  "title": "Can Proof Assistants Verify Multi-Agent Systems?",
  "abstract": "Abstract. This paper presents the SODA language for verifying multi-agent systems. SODA is a high-level functional and object-oriented language that supports the compilation of its code not only to Scala, a strongly statically typed high-level programming language, but also to Lean, a proof assistant and programming language. Given these capabilities, SODA can implement multi-agent systems, or parts thereof, that can then be integrated into a mainstream software ecosystem on the one hand and formally verified with state-of-the-art tools on the other hand. We provide a brief and informal introduction to SODA and the aforementioned interoperability capabilities, as well as a simple demonstration of how interaction protocols can be designed and verified with SODA. In the course of the demonstration, we highlight challenges with respect to real-world applicability.",
  "summary": "This paper explores using the SODA programming language to formally verify multi-agent systems (MAS). SODA compiles to both Scala (for execution) and Lean (a proof assistant), bridging the gap between implementation and formal verification. The researchers demonstrate this approach with a simplified e-commerce example, proving properties like list length invariance during transactions.  This is relevant to LLM-based multi-agent systems because it offers a potential pathway to formally verify the behavior of complex agent interactions, increasing reliability and trustworthiness.  The ability to combine practical execution with rigorous formal analysis addresses a key challenge in building robust and dependable multi-agent applications, particularly those incorporating LLMs.",
  "takeaways": "This paper introduces SODA, a language designed to bridge the gap between implementing multi-agent systems (MAS) and formally verifying their behavior.  While the paper uses Scala and Lean, its core concepts are highly relevant to JavaScript developers working with LLM-based multi-agent applications.  Here's how you can apply these insights:\n\n**1. Formalizing Agent Interactions:**\n\n* **Concept:** SODA emphasizes specifying agent interaction protocols and verifying their correctness.  This aligns with defining clear communication patterns for LLM agents in a web app.  Instead of relying solely on emergent behavior, you define how agents exchange information and make decisions.\n* **JavaScript Application:**  Use a message-passing framework like `Comlink` or a dedicated state management library like `Redux` or `MobX` to structure agent communication.  Define message types and schemas (e.g., using `JSON Schema`) for requests and responses. This allows for more predictable and debuggable agent interactions.\n\n**2. Invariants in JavaScript:**\n\n* **Concept:** The paper uses invariants—conditions that always hold true—to verify system properties. This helps ensure LLM agents adhere to specific rules and constraints within the web app.\n* **JavaScript Application:**  Implement runtime checks within your agent code to enforce invariants.  For example, if an agent's role is to manage resources, an invariant could be that the total resources never exceed a certain limit.  Libraries like `Zod` for data validation or custom assertion functions can be used for this.  Include logging and error handling to track invariant violations.\n\n**3. Functional Approach to Agent State:**\n\n* **Concept:** SODA's functional nature, where functions don't modify state directly but create new state, helps in reasoning about system behavior.\n* **JavaScript Application:**  Embrace immutable data structures with libraries like `Immer` or `Immutable.js`. This makes it easier to track changes, debug issues, and potentially implement undo/redo functionality within the agent system.\n\n**4. Simulating and Testing Agent Systems:**\n\n* **Concept:** The paper demonstrates testing agent behavior with simulated scenarios.\n* **JavaScript Application:** Create a testing environment where you can simulate different user interactions and observe agent responses. Tools like `Jest` and `Cypress` can be used for automated testing. Mocking LLM responses can be helpful for testing specific agent logic in isolation.\n\n**5. Agent Communication with LLMs:**\n\n* **Concept:**  The paper focuses on verifying the logic surrounding agent interactions.  This is especially relevant when integrating LLMs, as they become a critical part of the agent's decision-making process.\n* **JavaScript Application:** Use libraries like `LangChain.js` to manage prompts and responses to/from LLMs.  Define clear interfaces between your agent code and the LLM interactions. This allows you to test and refine the agent's behavior by modifying prompts, handling different LLM outputs, and ensuring the LLM integration aligns with the overall agent interaction protocol.\n\n**Example: Collaborative Document Editing with LLM Agents:**\n\nImagine a web app where multiple users collaborate on a document. LLM-powered agents could assist with tasks like:\n\n* **Summarization Agent:**  Summarizes changes made by users.\n* **Style Agent:** Ensures consistent writing style.\n* **Grammar Agent:** Corrects grammar and spelling errors.\n\nBy applying the principles from the paper:\n\n* You would define message types for agents to exchange document updates and requests (e.g., \"summarize section,\" \"check grammar\").\n* Invariants could ensure that agent actions don't overwrite user input or introduce conflicting changes.\n* A functional approach to document state would make it easier to track and revert agent actions.\n* You could simulate different editing scenarios to test agent behavior.\n\n\nBy adapting the SODA philosophy to JavaScript and utilizing existing frameworks and libraries, you can move towards building more robust and predictable LLM-based multi-agent web applications.  While full formal verification in JavaScript might be challenging, the core ideas from this paper provide valuable guidance for structuring and testing agent interactions, leading to more reliable and maintainable multi-agent systems.",
  "pseudocode": "The provided research paper uses SODA, a functional language that compiles to Scala and Lean, to formally verify aspects of multi-agent systems. While it contains code snippets in SODA resembling pseudocode, these are intended for direct translation to Scala and Lean rather than representing abstract algorithms. The paper focuses on showcasing the feasibility of formal verification using a proof assistant (Lean) in conjunction with a practical implementation language (Scala) via SODA.  Therefore, converting these snippets directly to JavaScript wouldn't align with the paper's core message, which is language interoperability for verification, not algorithmic demonstration.\n\nHowever, let's illustrate the core concepts with a JavaScript example inspired by the paper's list operations and property verification:\n\n```javascript\n// Immutable list implementation (simplified for demonstration)\nconst Nil = { tag: 'Nil' };\n\nconst Cons = (head, tail) => ({ tag: 'Cons', head, tail });\n\n// Length function (recursive)\nconst length_def = (list) => {\n  switch (list.tag) {\n    case 'Nil': return 0;\n    case 'Cons': return 1 + length_def(list.tail);\n  }\n};\n\n// Set element at index (immutable)\nconst set_def = (list, index, element) => {\n  switch (list.tag) {\n    case 'Nil': return Nil;\n    case 'Cons':\n      if (index === 0) return Cons(element, list.tail);\n      else return Cons(list.head, set_def(list.tail, index - 1, element));\n  }\n};\n\n\n// Example usage and property check\nconst myList = Cons(1, Cons(2, Cons(3, Nil)));\nconsole.log(\"Original list length:\", length_def(myList)); // Output: 3\n\nconst newList = set_def(myList, 1, 4);\nconsole.log(\"New list length:\", length_def(newList)); // Output: 3\n\nconsole.log(\"Original list:\", myList); // Original list remains unchanged\nconsole.log(\"New list:\", newList); // New list with modified element\n\n\n// Property check (length invariance after set)\nconst checkLengthInvariance = (list, index, element) =>\n  length_def(list) === length_def(set_def(list, index, element));\n\nconsole.log(\"Length Invariance:\", checkLengthInvariance(myList, 1, 4)); // Output: true\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThis JavaScript code demonstrates the concepts discussed in the paper:\n\n1. **Immutable Lists:**  `Nil` and `Cons` create immutable list structures. `set_def` creates a new list with the modification instead of mutating the original.\n2. **Recursive `length_def`:** Calculates list length recursively, similar to the paper's naive definition.\n3. **`set_def` function:** Replicates the paper's `set_def` functionality, creating a new list with the element at the specified index updated.\n4. **Property Verification (Simplified):** `checkLengthInvariance` function demonstrates a basic property check.  In a real-world scenario with a proof assistant, this would be formally proven.\n\nThis example illustrates the fundamental ideas behind the research paper in a way that's familiar to JavaScript developers. The focus remains on immutability and the possibility of formally verifying properties—key themes relevant to multi-agent systems where predictable and verifiable behavior is crucial.  In a full multi-agent application using LLMs, these list operations could represent aspects of agent knowledge or shared world state, where maintaining consistency and verifiability is essential.",
