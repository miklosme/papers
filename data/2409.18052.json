  "title": "Explaining Explaining",
  "abstract": "Explanation is key to people having confidence in high-stakes AI systems. However, machine-learning-based systems - which account for almost all current AI â€“ can't explain because they are usually black boxes. The explainable AI (XAI) movement hedges this problem by redefining \"explanation\". The human-centered explainable AI (HCXAI) movement identifies the explanation-oriented needs of users but can't fulfill them because of its commitment to machine learning. In order to achieve the kinds of explanations needed by real people operating in critical domains, we must rethink how to approach AI. We describe a hybrid approach to developing cognitive agents that uses a knowledge-based infrastructure supplemented by data obtained through machine learning when applicable. These agents will serve as assistants to humans who will bear ultimate responsibility for the decisions and actions of the human-robot team. We illustrate the explanatory potential of such agents using the under-the-hood panels of a demonstration system in which a team of simulated robots collaborates on search task assigned by a human.",
  "summary": "This research paper argues that while machine learning is powerful, it's difficult to explain how ML-based AI systems reach their conclusions. This is a problem for critical applications where trust and understanding are needed. The paper proposes a \"hybrid\" approach using LEIAs (Language-Endowed Intelligent Agents) that combine symbolic AI with machine learning. \n\nKey points for LLM-based multi-agent systems:\n\n* **Explainability is crucial:**  The paper stresses that for multi-agent systems in critical applications (like healthcare), being able to understand the system's reasoning is essential, which is a challenge for pure ML approaches.\n* **Hybrid approach:** Combining LLMs (for tasks where explainability is less crucial) with symbolic AI (for explainable reasoning) offers a more trustworthy approach.\n* **Under-the-hood panels:** These provide a visual way to trace the reasoning process of agents, making their actions more transparent to users.\n* **Tailored explanations:**  LEIAs are designed to tailor explanations to different users based on their needs and understanding, highlighting the importance of factors like \"mindreading\" in multi-agent communication.",
  "takeaways": "This paper advocates for a hybrid approach to building explainable AI systems, combining the strengths of LLMs with knowledge-based systems, particularly in scenarios where trust and transparency are critical. Here are some practical examples of how JavaScript developers can apply these insights to LLM-based multi-agent AI projects:\n\n**1. Building an E-commerce Chatbot Assistant:**\n\n* **Challenge:**  An e-commerce site wants a multi-agent system where an LLM-powered chatbot interacts with customer service agents to provide efficient and explainable support.\n* **Solution:**\n    * **LLM (e.g., GPT-3):**  Handle natural language understanding and dialog flow of customer interactions. \n    * **Knowledge Graph (e.g., implemented with Neo4j and accessed via a JS library):** Store product information, customer policies, shipping details, etc.\n    * **Rule-based System (e.g., using a JS rule engine like Nools):**  Define business logic for recommending products, applying discounts, and handling returns based on knowledge graph data. \n* **Explainability:** When a customer service agent questions the chatbot's recommendation, the system can provide a trace of:\n    * **Customer input:** The initial question asked.\n    * **Knowledge graph query:** The specific data retrieved from the knowledge graph.\n    * **Rule activation:** The business rule triggered by the data.\n    * **Final decision:** How the recommendation was generated.\n\n**2. Collaborative Project Management Tool:**\n\n* **Challenge:** Create a project management tool where multiple AI agents, representing different teams (design, development, marketing), collaborate on tasks.\n* **Solution:**\n    * **LLMs (e.g., GPT-3 for language, Codex for code generation):** Allow agents to communicate with each other in natural language and generate relevant code snippets.\n    * **Task Ontology (e.g., OWL, RDF, accessed with a JS library):** Define a shared understanding of tasks, dependencies, and deadlines.\n    * **Agent Communication Protocol (e.g., FIPA-ACL, implemented in JS):** Standardize how agents request information, negotiate deadlines, and report progress.\n* **Explainability:** When a human manager wants to understand why a task is delayed, the system can provide:\n    * **Agent communication logs:** Show the history of requests, responses, and negotiations between agents. \n    * **Task dependency visualization (e.g., using a JS library like D3.js):** Highlight the critical path in the project timeline and which agent's actions are impacting the delay.\n    * **Reasoning behind decisions (e.g., using a truth maintenance system implemented in JS):** Explain why an agent chose a particular action based on its knowledge and goals. \n\n**JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries:**\n\n* **LLM APIs:** OpenAI API, Hugging Face Transformers.js\n* **Knowledge Graph:** Neo4j, Dgraph, with respective JavaScript drivers.\n* **Rule Engines:** Nools, json-rules-engine.\n* **Data Visualization:** D3.js, Chart.js.\n* **Ontology/Semantic Web:** rdflib.js, jsonld.js\n\n**Key Takeaways for Developers:**\n\n* **Hybrid Approach is Key:** Combine the power of LLMs with the structure and reasoning capabilities of knowledge-based systems.\n* **Explainability by Design:** Plan for explainability from the start, designing agents and interactions to make decisions transparent.\n* **Choose the Right Tools:** Leverage JavaScript's ecosystem of libraries and frameworks for LLM integration, knowledge representation, rule-based systems, and data visualization.\n\nBy embracing this hybrid approach and prioritizing explainability, JavaScript developers can unlock the potential of LLM-based multi-agent systems to create intelligent, trustworthy, and impactful web applications.",
