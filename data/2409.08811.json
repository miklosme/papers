  "title": "Mutual Theory of Mind in Human-Al Collaboration: An Empirical Study with LLM-driven Al Agents in a Real-time Shared Workspace Task",
  "abstract": "Human-AI teams (HATs) are increasingly common, but understanding how AI agents with theory of mind (ToM) can effectively collaborate with humans in real-time shared workspace settings is still an open question. We conducted a mixed-design experiment to investigate the impact of mutual theory of mind (MToM) on HAT performance and collaboration process in a real-time shared workspace task based on Overcooked. We find that the agent's ToM ability does not significantly impact team performance but can enhance human understanding of the agent. We also found that the interactivity of communication impacts the team performance with the best performance achieved when both humans and agents are forbidden to communicate. Our results suggest that human communication preferences and the human perception of the agent's ToM are essential aspects of the MToM process in real-time shared workspace settings. We further discussed humans' understanding of agents with ToM abilities, highlighting that implicit communication plays an important role in human perception and understanding of agents in shared workspace settings. The agent's ToM capability and the communication interactivity will be crucial for future design of human-AI collaborative agents.",
  "summary": "This research explores how humans and AI agents with Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities interact and collaborate in real-time tasks within a shared workspace. \n\n- It finds that an LLM-driven AI agent with ToM can enhance human understanding and feeling of being understood, even if not significantly impacting team performance.\n- Bidirectional verbal communication may hinder performance due to increased workload and distraction for the human.\n- Humans tend to rely on observing the AI's actions rather than verbal communication to infer its intentions and coordinate their own actions.\n- The AI agent's ability to adapt its behavior based on human actions is crucial for effective collaboration. \n- Hallucination in LLMs can negatively influence ToM capabilities, requiring protective measures for future applications. \n- Exploring multi-level recursive ToM processes and enhancing non-verbal communication abilities of LLM-driven agents are important future directions.",
  "takeaways": "This paper provides valuable insights for JavaScript developers working on LLM-based multi-agent AI systems, particularly in web development scenarios. Here are some practical examples of how the findings can be applied:\n\n**1. Prioritizing Non-Verbal Communication through Visual Cues:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Building a collaborative web-based design tool where multiple users (including AI agents) can work together on a canvas.\n* **Application:** Instead of relying heavily on text chat for coordination, focus on designing a visually rich interface where actions are intuitively represented. \n    * Use libraries like Fabric.js or Paper.js to visually represent objects, their states, and actions performed on them (e.g., an AI agent dragging an element on the canvas).\n    * Implement animations to showcase AI agent intentions (e.g., highlighting an area an AI wants to modify).\n    * Employ real-time visual feedback mechanisms (e.g., progress bars, color changes) to convey the AI's progress and understanding of human actions.\n\n**2. Leveraging Implicit Communication through Observational ToM:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Developing an AI-powered chatbot that assists customer service agents in real-time by analyzing conversations and suggesting relevant responses.\n* **Application:** Train the LLM-based agent to understand the context and nuances of the customer interaction by:\n    * Analyzing the customer's messages and agent's responses using natural language processing techniques (e.g., sentiment analysis with libraries like Sentiment or Compromise).\n    * Observing the agent's actions within the customer service platform (e.g., searching for information, opening specific resources) to infer intent and predict needs.\n    * Using this understanding to proactively suggest helpful resources, responses, or actions to the agent without explicit verbal prompts, enhancing efficiency and collaboration.\n\n**3. Understanding ToM Perception and Agent Feedback:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Creating a collaborative project management web application where AI agents contribute to task allocation and progress tracking.\n* **Application:** \n    * Conduct user studies or A/B testing to understand how users perceive the AI agent's ToM capabilities (e.g., using questionnaires and behavioral analysis).\n    * Allow users to provide explicit feedback on the AI agent's understanding and actions through simple interface elements (e.g., thumbs up/down ratings, feedback buttons).\n    * Use this feedback to refine the AI agent's ToM model and improve its alignment with user expectations, especially regarding task difficulty perception.\n\n**4. Balancing Verbal and Non-Verbal Communication:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Designing a real-time multi-player web game with both human and AI players.\n* **Application:**\n    * Carefully consider the real-time constraints of the game and the cognitive load of verbal communication on players.\n    * Limit verbal communication to essential coordination and strategic discussions, leveraging a concise and intuitive command system (e.g., pre-defined messages, quick chat options).\n    * Supplement verbal communication with rich non-verbal cues like game world actions, character animations, and visual indicators to convey information effectively.\n    * Experiment with different communication interactivity levels (bidirectional, unidirectional, limited) to find the optimal balance for user experience and team performance.\n\n**Frameworks and Libraries:**\n\n* **LLM Interaction:** LangChain, Transformers.js (for client-side LLM interaction)\n* **Web Development:** React, Vue, Angular\n* **Canvas Manipulation:** Fabric.js, Paper.js\n* **NLP:** Compromise, Sentiment, Natural\n* **User Interface Design:** Material UI, Bootstrap\n\nBy incorporating these insights and using relevant JavaScript tools, developers can create LLM-based multi-agent AI systems for the web that are more effective, intuitive, and aligned with human collaborative preferences. Remember, the focus should be on fostering seamless human-AI teamwork, where both parties understand and complement each other's actions and intentions.",
