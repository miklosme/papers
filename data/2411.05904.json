  "title": "Autonomous Industrial Control using an Agentic Framework with Large Language Models",
  "abstract": "Abstract: As chemical plants evolve towards full autonomy, the need for effective fault handling and control in dynamic, unpredictable environments becomes increasingly critical. This paper proposes an innovative approach to industrial automation, introducing validation and reprompting architectures utilizing large language model (LLM)-based autonomous control agents. The proposed agentic system comprising of operator, validator, and reprompter agents enables autonomous management of control tasks, adapting to unforeseen disturbances without human intervention. By utilizing validation and reprompting architectures, the framework allows agents to recover from errors and continuously improve decision-making in real-time industrial scenarios. We hypothesize that this mechanism will enhance performance and reliability across a variety of LLMs, offering a path toward fully autonomous systems capable of handling unexpected challenges, paving the way for robust, adaptive control in complex industrial environments. To demonstrate the concept's effectiveness, we created a simple case study involving a temperature control experiment embedded on a microcontroller device, validating the proposed approach.",
  "summary": "This paper proposes a framework for autonomous industrial control using multiple LLM-based agents, particularly for handling unexpected events.  A key innovation is the \"reprompting architecture,\" where a \"Reprompter Agent\" refines the actions of an \"Actor Agent\" based on feedback from a \"Validator Agent\" interacting with a digital twin.  This iterative feedback loop improves the LLM agent's decision-making, leading to safer and more effective actions. A temperature control case study using different OpenAI LLMs demonstrates the framework's ability to enhance control performance and reliability, especially with reprompting.  The research highlights the potential of LLM-based multi-agent systems and reprompting for robust industrial automation.",
  "takeaways": "This paper's core concept of a reprompting architecture for LLM-based multi-agent systems translates well into practical JavaScript applications, particularly in complex web development scenarios. Here are some practical examples, focusing on web development contexts and utilizing relevant JavaScript technologies:\n\n**1. Interactive Narrative Generation:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine building an interactive story where user choices influence the narrative.  Multiple LLM agents could represent different characters or narrative elements.\n* **Multi-Agent System:**\n    * *Storyteller Agent (Actor):* Generates narrative text based on current story state.  Uses a JavaScript library like `transformers.js` or a cloud API for LLM interaction.\n    * *Consistency Agent (Validator):* Checks if the generated text contradicts established story elements or lore, leveraging a local knowledge graph implemented with a library like `jsonld.js`.\n    * *Reprompter Agent:* If inconsistencies arise, provides alternative prompts to the Storyteller Agent, perhaps suggesting different phrasing or narrative directions. This can be managed using a JavaScript state management library like Redux or Zustand.\n* **Implementation:** The reprompting loop could be implemented with asynchronous JavaScript using `async/await`, ensuring a smooth user experience while the agents interact.\n\n**2. Collaborative Code Generation:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  A multi-agent system assists developers in writing code.\n* **Multi-Agent System:**\n    * *Code Generator Agent (Actor):* Generates code snippets based on developer requests using libraries like `transformers.js`.\n    * *Style/Linting Agent (Validator):* Checks the generated code against pre-defined style guides and linting rules, potentially utilizing tools like ESLint programmatically within the agent.\n    * *Reprompter Agent:* Suggests code improvements or alternative implementations if the generated code fails style checks or contains errors.\n* **Implementation:** A browser extension could integrate these agents into the developer's IDE, providing real-time code assistance and reprompting feedback using JavaScript event listeners.\n\n**3. Personalized Web Experiences:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  Tailor a website's content and layout based on user preferences and behavior.\n* **Multi-Agent System:**\n    * *Content Curator Agent (Actor):* Selects and presents relevant content based on user profile and context.\n    * *User Experience Agent (Validator):* Evaluates the proposed layout and content presentation based on usability heuristics or A/B testing data, which could be logged and analyzed using JavaScript libraries.\n    * *Reprompter Agent:* Refines content selection and layout based on user engagement metrics and feedback, potentially using JavaScript animation libraries to dynamically adjust the interface.\n* **Implementation:** A Node.js backend could host these agents, interacting with the frontend via websockets to dynamically update the user experience using JavaScript frameworks like React or Vue.js.\n\n**Key JavaScript Technologies and Frameworks:**\n\n* **LLM Interaction:** `transformers.js`, LangchainJS, cloud-based LLM APIs\n* **State Management:** Redux, Zustand, MobX\n* **Knowledge Graphs:** `jsonld.js`, other graph databases with JavaScript APIs\n* **Frontend Frameworks:** React, Vue.js, Angular\n* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js\n* **Real-time Communication:** Websockets, Socket.IO\n\n\nBy implementing these concepts with readily available JavaScript technologies, developers can build more robust, responsive, and intelligent web applications. The reprompting architecture allows for continuous improvement and adaptation, essential for handling the dynamic and complex nature of the web environment.  This approach empowers JavaScript developers to create the next generation of intelligent web experiences.",
  "pseudocode": "No pseudocode block found. However, the paper describes a multi-agent system architecture.  While not presented in pseudocode, the logic of the agents can be represented in JavaScript. Here's a simplified illustration:\n\n```javascript\n// Agent definitions (using a class structure for illustration)\nclass MonitoringAgent {\n  constructor(plant, tLab) {\n    this.plant = plant;\n    this.tLab = tLab; // TCLab interface (assuming it exists)\n  }\n\n  async getState() {\n    // Get plant state (temperature from TCLab)\n    const temperature = await this.tLab.getTemperature();\n    return { temperature };\n  }\n\n  detectAnomaly(state) {\n    return state.temperature > 27 || state.temperature < 25;\n  }\n}\n\nclass ActorAgent {\n  constructor(llm, hi_temp, lo_temp) {\n    this.llm = llm; // LLM interface\n    this.hi_temp = hi_temp;\n    this.lo_temp = lo_temp;\n  }\n\n  async getAction(state) {\n    const prompt = `Task: Operate the system between ${this.lo_temp}°C and ${this.hi_temp}°C. ... (Rest of prompt from Fig. 4)`;\n    const response = await this.llm.generate(prompt, {\n      curr_state: state, // Pass current state to the LLM\n      // ... other parameters\n    });\n    const action = parseInt(response.text); // Parse action (1 or 0)\n    return action;\n  }\n}\n\nclass ValidatorAgent {\n  constructor(digitalTwin) {\n    this.digitalTwin = digitalTwin; // Digital twin interface\n  }\n\n  async validateAction(action, state) {\n    // Simulate action on digital twin\n    const simulationResult = await this.digitalTwin.simulate(action, state);\n    // Check if temperature stays within range\n    return (\n      simulationResult.temperature >= 25 &&\n      simulationResult.temperature <= 27\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nclass ReprompterAgent {\n  constructor(llm, validator) {\n    this.llm = llm;\n    this.validator = validator;\n  }\n\n  async reprompt(originalAction, state, attempts = 0) {\n\n    if (attempts >= 3) {  // Safety check - limit reprompt attempts\n        return 0; // Default to safe action (cooling) if too many attempts\n    }\n\n    const newPrompt = `Previous action ${originalAction} failed.  Suggest a new action. ...`; // Refined prompt\n    const response = await this.llm.generate(newPrompt, { state });\n    const newAction = parseInt(response.text);\n\n    const isValid = await this.validator.validateAction(newAction, state);\n    return isValid ? newAction : this.reprompt(newAction, state, attempts + 1);\n  }\n}\n\n\n// Example Usage (simplified):\nasync function runControlLoop(plant, tLab, llm, digitalTwin) {\n\n  const monitoringAgent = new MonitoringAgent(plant, tLab);\n  const actorAgent = new ActorAgent(llm, 27, 25);\n  const validatorAgent = new ValidatorAgent(digitalTwin);\n  const reprompterAgent = new ReprompterAgent(llm, validatorAgent);\n\n\n  while (true) {\n    const state = await monitoringAgent.getState();\n    if (monitoringAgent.detectAnomaly(state)) {\n      let action = await actorAgent.getAction(state);\n      let isValid = await validatorAgent.validateAction(action, state);\n\n      if (!isValid) {\n        action = await reprompterAgent.reprompt(action, state);\n      }\n\n      await tLab.setAction(action); // Implement action on TCLab\n    }\n\n    await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 1000)); // Wait\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n\nThis code provides a basic structure for the multi-agent system described in the paper. It uses placeholder interfaces (`tLab`, `llm`, `digitalTwin`) which would need to be replaced with actual implementations for interacting with the TCLab, the LLM (e.g., OpenAI API), and the digital twin. The code demonstrates how the agents interact, using prompts, validation, and reprompting to control the system. The safety override (after 3 failed reprompt attempts) is also incorporated. This JavaScript representation helps to translate the conceptual framework into a more concrete and practical form for software engineers. It can serve as a starting point for building a real-world implementation of this LLM-based multi-agent control system. Remember to expand and adapt this structure based on the specifics of your control system and environment.",
