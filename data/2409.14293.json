  "title": "A novel load distribution strategy for aggregators using IoT-enabled mobile devices",
  "abstract": "Abstract-The rapid proliferation of Internet-of-things (IoT) as well as mobile devices such as Electric Vehicles (EVs), has led to unpredictable load at the grid. The demand to supply ratio is particularly exacerbated at a few grid aggregators (charging stations) with excessive demand due to the geographic location, peak time, etc. Existing solutions on demand response cannot achieve significant improvements based only on time-shifting the loads without considering the device properties such as charging modes and movement capabilities to enable geographic migration. Additionally, the information on the spare capacity at a few aggregators can aid in re-channeling the load from other aggregators facing excess demand to allow migration of devices. In this paper, we model these flexible properties of the devices as a mixed-integer non-linear problem (MINLP) to minimize excess load and the improve the utility (benefit) across all devices. We propose an online distributed low-complexity heuristic that prioritizes devices based on demand and deadlines to minimize the cumulative loss in utility. The proposed heuristic is tested on an exhaustive set of synthetic data and compared with solutions from a solver/optimization tool for the same runtime to show the impracticality of using a solver. A real-world EV testbed data is also tested with our proposed solution and other scheduling solutions to show the practicality of generating a feasible schedule and a loss improvement of at least 57.23%.",
  "summary": "This paper tackles the problem of efficiently distributing energy loads in a smart grid with diverse devices, including mobile ones like electric vehicles (EVs). It proposes a new strategy considering:\n\n* **Heterogeneous devices:** Devices have varying energy needs, deadlines, and can operate in multiple power modes (e.g., an EV charging at different speeds).\n* **Mobility:**  Some devices, like EVs, can move between aggregators (local energy providers) to find better access to power.\n\nThe authors formulate this as a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem and offer a lightweight, distributed algorithm for real-time scheduling. \n\n**Relevance to LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems:**\n\n* **Decentralized decision-making:**  The proposed algorithm highlights the potential of having intelligent agents (devices) make local decisions based on their needs and available information, similar to how LLMs can enable agency in multi-agent systems.\n* **Resource allocation:** Balancing energy demand and supply across the grid mirrors the challenges of managing resources in complex LLM-powered applications.\n* **Dynamic environment:**  The incorporation of mobile devices with changing needs and locations showcases the system's ability to adapt to a dynamic environment, a crucial aspect of real-world multi-agent systems.",
  "takeaways": "This research paper focuses on optimizing energy distribution across a network, particularly relevant with the rise of electric vehicles and smart grids. While not directly about LLMs or multi-agent AI for web development, it offers valuable concepts transferable to those domains. Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights:\n\n**1. Prioritizing LLM Task Distribution:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine building a multi-agent web app where each agent, powered by an LLM, specializes in tasks like text generation, translation, or code analysis. \n* **Application:**  This paper's priority function (Equation 10) inspires a similar approach for LLMs.  You can prioritize tasks based on:\n    * **Urgency (Deadline):**  Time-sensitive requests (e.g., real-time chat) get higher priority.\n    * **Complexity (Demand):**  Resource-intensive tasks (e.g., generating long-form content) might have lower priority than simpler ones.\n    * **Agent Specialization (Power Modes):**  Assign tasks to LLMs best suited for them, considering their strengths (e.g., a code-generation LLM handles code requests).\n\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    ```javascript\n    function calculateTaskPriority(task) {\n      const timeToDeadline = task.deadline - Date.now();\n      const complexityFactor = task.estimatedResources / 10; // Adjust scaling\n      let priority = (1 / timeToDeadline) * complexityFactor;\n\n      // Additional factors (agent load, task type, etc.)\n      // ...\n\n      return priority;\n    }\n    ```\n\n**2. Agent Communication and Coordination:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  LLM-based agents need to exchange information (e.g., partial results, task status) efficiently.\n* **Application:** The paper emphasizes communication between aggregators (analogous to agent groups or a central coordinator).\n    * **Message Queue (Backhaul Network):** Use a message queue like Redis or RabbitMQ to simulate the backhaul network, enabling asynchronous communication.\n    * **WebSockets (Real-time Updates):** For real-time coordination in the browser, consider WebSockets.\n\n* **JavaScript Example (Simplified with Socket.IO):**\n    ```javascript\n    // Server-side (Node.js)\n    io.on('connection', (socket) => {\n      socket.on('taskUpdate', (data) => {\n        // Broadcast update to relevant agents\n        socket.broadcast.emit('updateReceived', data); \n      });\n    });\n\n    // Client-side (Browser)\n    socket.on('updateReceived', (data) => {\n      // Update UI or agent behavior based on received data\n    });\n    ```\n\n**3. Dynamic Resource Allocation (Mobility):**\n\n* **Scenario:**  In web apps, agent workloads can fluctuate.  Some LLMs might be overloaded, while others are idle.\n* **Application:**  While complex, the paper's concept of \"mobility\" (shifting devices between aggregators) can inspire:\n    * **Agent Migration:**  Design a system where less loaded agents can \"take over\" tasks from overloaded ones. This requires careful task splitting and state transfer. \n    * **Dynamic Scaling:** Use cloud functions or serverless technologies to automatically scale the number of LLM instances based on demand.\n\n**JavaScript Libraries and Frameworks:**\n\n* **LangChain:** Simplifies the integration of LLMs into JavaScript applications.\n* **AutoGPT:**  Provides higher-level orchestration of LLM agents for achieving goals.\n* **Message Queues:** Redis, RabbitMQ, or cloud-based solutions (AWS SQS, Google Pub/Sub).\n* **WebSockets:** Socket.IO provides an easier abstraction over raw WebSockets.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **LLM Cost:**  Running multiple LLMs can be expensive. Carefully design your priority and resource allocation strategies.\n* **Complexity:** Implementing true agent \"mobility\" with LLMs is challenging. Start with simpler coordination mechanisms.\n* **Experimentation:** The field is rapidly evolving.  Treat these ideas as starting points and experiment to find what works best for your application. \n\nBy drawing parallels between the paper's concepts and the challenges of building LLM-based multi-agent systems, JavaScript developers can develop more efficient, scalable, and robust web applications.",
  "pseudocode": "```javascript\n// Aggregator Level Logic (Lines 7-17 of Algorithm 1)\n\nfor (const device of devices) {\n  // Compute accumulated utility for the device\n  device.computeAccumulatedUtility(); \n\n  // Compute priority based on Eq. 10\n  device.priority = computePriority(\n    device.accumulatedUtility,\n    device.energyDemand,\n    currentTime, \n    device.deadline\n  );\n}\n\n// Sort devices by priority in descending order\ndevices.sort((a, b) => b.priority - a.priority); \n\nfor (const device of devices) {\n  // Assign the lowest feasible power mode\n  device.assignedPowerMode = device.getLowestFeasiblePowerMode(aggregator.availablePower);\n\n  // Update aggregator available power\n  aggregator.availablePower -= device.assignedPowerMode; \n}\n\n// Attempt to upgrade power mode if possible\nfor (const device of devices) {\n  if (aggregator.availablePower > 0) {\n    device.assignedPowerMode = device.getNextHigherPowerMode(aggregator.availablePower);\n    aggregator.availablePower -= device.assignedPowerMode;\n  } else {\n    break; // No more power available\n  }\n}\n\n// Update and share aggregator load information\naggregator.updateStatusList();\naggregator.shareStatusList(devices); \n\n\n// Device Level Logic (Lines 18-24 of Algorithm 1)\n\nconst aggregatorStatus = receiveStatusList();\n\nif (device.assignedPowerMode === 0 && device.isMobile) {\n  let bestUtilityLoss = Infinity;\n  let targetAggregator = null;\n\n  for (const aggregator of aggregatorStatus) {\n    const moveCost = calculateMoveCost(\n      currentAggregator,\n      aggregator\n    );\n\n    const utilityLoss = device.calculateUtilityLoss(\n      moveCost,\n      currentTime\n    );\n\n    if (utilityLoss < bestUtilityLoss) {\n      bestUtilityLoss = utilityLoss;\n      targetAggregator = aggregator;\n    }\n  }\n\n  if (bestUtilityLoss < device.calculateUtilityLoss(0, currentTime)) {\n    // Send a movement request to the target aggregator\n    sendMovementRequest(targetAggregator);\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe JavaScript code implements a simplified version of the distributed algorithm described in the research paper. \n\n**Aggregator Level:**\n\n1. **Priority-based Scheduling:**  \n   - Each aggregator iterates through its connected devices.\n   - It computes the `accumulatedUtility` for each device (Eq. 4 in the paper) and uses it to calculate the `priority` (Eq. 10).\n   - Devices are sorted based on priority in descending order (highest loss first).\n   - The aggregator tries to assign the lowest feasible power mode to each device, taking into account the available power. \n   - If there's any power left, the aggregator attempts to upgrade the power modes of devices (in priority order).\n   - Finally, the aggregator updates its load status and shares it with all devices.\n\n**Device Level:**\n\n1. **Mobility Decision:**\n   - Mobile devices that haven't been allocated any power (`assignedPowerMode === 0`) will evaluate potential moves to other aggregators. \n   - For each potential move, the device calculates the `moveCost` and the resulting `utilityLoss`.\n   - If a move results in lower utility loss compared to staying at the current aggregator, the device sends a movement request to the best target aggregator.\n\n**Purpose:**\n\nThe algorithm aims to minimize the overall utility loss in the system by:\n\n- **Prioritizing Critical Devices:** Devices with higher potential utility loss (closer deadlines, higher criticality) are given higher priority for power allocation.\n- **Enabling Mobility for Better Resource Utilization:** Mobile devices can dynamically move to less congested aggregators to potentially improve their chances of receiving power and minimize their own utility loss.\n\n**Note:** This JavaScript implementation provides a high-level structure and omits some details from the paper (like specific utility loss calculations, power mode feasibility checks, etc.) for brevity. You'll need to fill in those details based on the exact formulas and constraints provided in the research paper to create a fully functional implementation.",
