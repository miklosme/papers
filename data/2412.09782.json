  "title": "EI-Drive: A Platform for Cooperative Perception with Realistic Communication Models",
  "abstract": "Abstract-The growing interest in autonomous driving calls for realistic simulation platforms capable of accurately simulating cooperative perception process in realistic traffic scenarios. Existing studies for cooperative perception often have not accounted for transmission latency and errors in real-world environments. To address this gap, we introduce EI-Drive, an edge-AI based autonomous driving simulation platform that integrates advanced cooperative perception with more realistic communication models. Built on the CARLA framework, EI-Drive features new modules for cooperative perception while taking into account transmission latency and errors, providing a more realistic platform for evaluating cooperative perception algorithms. In particular, the platform enables vehicles to fuse data from multiple sources, improving situational awareness and safety in complex environments. With its modular design, EI-Drive allows for detailed exploration of sensing, perception, planning, and control in various cooperative driving scenarios. Experiments using EI-Drive demonstrate significant improvements in vehicle safety and performance, particularly in scenarios with complex traffic flow and network conditions. All code and documents are accessible on our GitHub page: https://ucd-dare.github.io/eidrive.github.io/.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces EI-Drive, a new autonomous driving simulation platform built on CARLA that incorporates realistic communication models (including latency and errors) into cooperative perception. This allows for more realistic testing of multi-agent autonomous driving algorithms.\n\nKey features for LLM-based multi-agent systems include: the realistic communication model simulating latency and errors between agents (crucial for accurate multi-agent interactions), the ability to fuse data from heterogeneous agents like vehicles and RSUs using a simple late fusion method (demonstrating a basic form of multi-agent cooperation which could be extended with LLMs), and customizable built-in scenarios for testing complex multi-agent interactions under various network conditions.  This allows researchers to explore how LLMs can improve communication and cooperation within multi-agent systems, particularly in handling uncertainty and delays.",
  "takeaways": "This paper introduces EI-Drive, a platform for simulating realistic multi-agent autonomous driving scenarios with a focus on cooperative perception and realistic communication models.  Let's explore how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights to LLM-based multi-agent web applications:\n\n**1. Simulating Realistic Communication:**\n\n* **Latency & Errors:** EI-Drive emphasizes the impact of latency and errors. In JavaScript, you can simulate these using `setTimeout` and random error generation. Imagine a multi-agent chat application using LLMs. To simulate latency, wrap message sending in a `setTimeout` with a randomized delay:\n```javascript\nfunction sendMessage(message, recipient) {\n  const latency = Math.random() * 500; // Simulate up to 500ms latency\n  setTimeout(() => {\n      if (Math.random() < 0.05) { // 5% chance of error\n          console.error(\"Message transmission failed!\");\n          return;\n      }\n      // Send the message (using your actual messaging logic)\n      recipient.receiveMessage(message); \n  }, latency);\n}\n```\n* **Partial Information:**  Simulate dropped messages or incomplete data. For instance, in a collaborative document editing app using LLMs, randomly remove parts of updates before distributing them to other clients.\n\n**2. Cooperative Perception (Data Fusion):**\n\n* **Client-Side Fusion:** In a web-based multi-agent game using LLMs for agent control, each client can run its own perception model (e.g., image recognition using TensorFlow.js) and share partial observations.  Fusion could occur client-side using a simple averaging of positions, or a more complex weighted average based on confidence scores from each client's LLM.\n```javascript\nfunction fuseObservations(observations) {\n  const fusedPosition = observations.reduce((sum, obs) => sum + obs.position * obs.confidence, 0) /\n                       observations.reduce((sum, obs) => sum + obs.confidence, 0);\n   return fusedPosition;\n}\n```\n\n* **Server-Side Fusion:**  A server could be responsible for data fusion, especially with many agents. This might involve sending raw sensor-like data (e.g., canvas snapshots in a game) to the server for processing and then broadcasting fused information back to clients. Node.js with a library like Socket.IO would be suitable for this real-time communication.\n\n**3. Modular Pipeline:**\n\n* **JavaScript Frameworks:** Frameworks like React or Vue.js naturally support modularity. You can create components for Sensing (e.g., user input or webcam data), Perception (LLM-based interpretations), Planning (decision-making logic), and Acting (updates to the UI).\n* **Event-Driven Architecture:** Design your agents with an event-driven architecture to decouple modules. For example, a \"perceptionComplete\" event could trigger the planning module.\n\n**4. Heterogeneous Agents:**\n\n* **Specialized Agents:**  Create different types of agents using JavaScript classes, each with its own LLM. One agent might be an LLM specializing in summarizing text, another in generating code, while another focuses on dialogue, interacting to create a more robust application.\n* **Role-Based Communication:** Design communication patterns based on agent roles.  In a multi-agent customer support system, an LLM-powered chatbot might handle initial queries, then pass complex issues to a human agent.\n\n**5. Experimentation and Visualization:**\n\n* **Browser-Based Visualization:**  Visualize your multi-agent system's behavior directly in the browser using libraries like Chart.js or D3.js to track metrics like message latency, error rates, or agent performance.\n* **Logging & Analysis:**  Log interactions and performance data to analyze the impact of different latency, error rates, and fusion methods.\n\n**Example: Collaborative Code Editor**\n\nImagine building a collaborative code editor where multiple developers can write code simultaneously.  LLMs can assist with code generation, error detection, and auto-completion. You could incorporate the following EI-Drive-inspired features:\n\n* **Latency Simulation:**  Simulate network lag by delaying code updates between clients.\n* **Cooperative Error Detection:** Fuse error detection outputs from individual LLM agents on each client to get a more robust overall error detection.\n* **Modular Design:** Use React to separate code editing components, LLM interaction modules, and communication logic.\n\n\nBy incorporating these ideas, JavaScript developers can create more robust and realistic LLM-based multi-agent applications that are better prepared for the complexities of real-world deployment.  EI-Drive provides a valuable framework for thinking about these challenges and offering practical solutions using familiar JavaScript tools and technologies.",
