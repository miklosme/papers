  "title": "Bel Esprit: Multi-Agent Framework for Building AI Model Pipelines",
  "abstract": "As the demand for artificial intelligence (AI) grows to address complex real-world tasks, single models are often insufficient, requiring the integration of multiple models into pipelines. This paper introduces Bel Esprit, a conversational agent designed to construct AI model pipelines based on user-defined requirements. Bel Esprit employs a multi-agent framework where subagents collaborate to clarify requirements, build, validate, and populate pipelines with appropriate models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework in generating pipelines from ambiguous user queries, using both human-curated and synthetic data. A detailed error analysis highlights ongoing challenges in pipeline construction. Bel Esprit is available for a free trial at https://belesprit.aixplain.comÂ¹.",
  "summary": "Bel Esprit is a multi-agent system that helps build pipelines of AI models based on user requests, like creating a system for multilingual video dubbing.  It uses multiple AI agents that work together to clarify user requests, build the pipeline, check for errors, and select the best AI models for the job.\n\nKey points for LLM-based multi-agent systems:\n\n* **Multi-agent collaboration:**  Different LLM agents (Mentalist, Builder, Inspector, Matchmaker) handle distinct tasks in building and refining the AI pipeline.\n* **Iterative refinement:** The system uses a loop where the Builder creates a pipeline, the Inspector checks for errors, and the Builder revises until the pipeline is correct.\n* **Chain-of-branches:** Complex pipelines are built step-by-step, branch by branch, to reduce errors and make the process more manageable.\n* **Handling ambiguity:** The Mentalist agent clarifies ambiguous user requests by asking clarifying questions and converting them into structured specifications.\n* **Generic LLMs for fallback:** When a specific AI model isn't available for a task, a general-purpose LLM with a custom prompt can be used as a fallback.\n* **Script generation:** For simple tasks not suited for LLMs, the system can generate scripts using another LLM.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents Bel Esprit, a multi-agent framework for constructing AI model pipelines based on user queries.  Let's explore how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights to LLM-based multi-agent web applications:\n\n**1. Mentalist (Query Clarification):**\n\n* **Scenario:**  A user wants to build a web app that summarizes news articles from different languages.  Their initial query might be vague: \"Summarize news.\"\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** Use a chatbot interface (e.g., a custom implementation with WebSockets or a library like Botpress) to engage the user in a clarifying dialogue. Employ prompt engineering techniques similar to those used by Bel Esprit's Mentalist, prompting the user for details like input language, desired output length, and specific news sources.\n\n```javascript\n// Example using a hypothetical chatbot API\nchatbot.ask(\"What language are the news articles in?\");\nchatbot.onReply((language) => {\n  chatbot.ask(`What is your desired summary length? (e.g., short, medium, long)`);\n  // ... further clarification ...\n});\n```\n\n**2. Builder (Pipeline Construction):**\n\n* **Scenario:** Based on the clarified user needs (e.g., summarize English news articles into short summaries), construct a pipeline.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** Represent the pipeline as a JavaScript object or JSON structure. Leverage a JavaScript graph library like Cytoscape.js or Vis.js to visualize and manipulate the pipeline.  The LLM can be accessed via API calls to services like OpenAI or through local embeddings and libraries for similarity comparisons.\n\n```javascript\n// Example pipeline representation (JSON)\nconst pipeline = {\n  nodes: [\n    { id: \"input\", type: \"text\", modality: \"English\" },\n    { id: \"summarizer\", type: \"LLM\", function: \"summarize\", params: { length: \"short\" } },\n    { id: \"output\", type: \"text\", modality: \"English\" }\n  ],\n  edges: [\n    { source: \"input\", target: \"summarizer\" },\n    { source: \"summarizer\", target: \"output\" }\n  ]\n};\n```\n\n**3. Inspector (Pipeline Validation):**\n\n* **Scenario:** Ensure the constructed pipeline is valid (syntactically and semantically).  For example, check if the output of a translation model is compatible with the input of a summarization model.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** Implement validation functions in JavaScript. For syntactic checks, validate the pipeline structure against defined constraints using schema validation libraries. For semantic validation, leverage LLMs through API calls to assess alignment with the user's query, similar to Bel Esprit's approach.  Use Jest or similar testing frameworks for robust unit testing of validation logic.\n\n```javascript\n// Example semantic validation (hypothetical LLM API call)\nconst validationResult = await llm.validatePipeline(pipeline, userQuery);\nif (validationResult.isValid) { // ... proceed ... }\n```\n\n**4. Matchmaker (Model Selection):**\n\n* **Scenario:** Select appropriate models for each pipeline stage. For example, choose a suitable English summarization model.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** Maintain a registry of available models (e.g., a JSON file or database).  The Matchmaker logic can be implemented in JavaScript, considering factors like user preferences, model performance, and cost.\n\n```javascript\n// Example model registry (JSON)\nconst models = {\n  \"summarization\": {\n    \"English\": [\"modelA\", \"modelB\", \"modelC\"]\n  },\n  // ... other functions and languages ...\n};\n\nfunction selectModel(functionType, language) { \n  // ... selection logic ... \n}\n```\n\n**5. Chain-of-Branches (Complex Pipeline Construction):**\n\n* **Scenario:** Break down a complex pipeline (e.g., translate, then summarize multiple articles) into smaller, manageable branches.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** Implement a recursive function to construct the pipeline branch by branch, representing each branch as a separate pipeline structure (JSON) before combining them.\n\n**Key JavaScript Libraries/Frameworks:**\n\n* **LLM APIs:** OpenAI, Cohere, etc.\n* **Chatbot Libraries:** Botpress, Rasa, etc.\n* **Graph Visualization:** Cytoscape.js, Vis.js\n* **Testing Framework:** Jest\n\nBy combining these elements, a JavaScript developer can create a web application that dynamically builds and executes LLM-based AI pipelines based on interactive user queries, mirroring the core principles of the Bel Esprit framework. This approach empowers users to customize their AI workflows without needing in-depth technical expertise, opening up new possibilities for web-based AI applications.",
