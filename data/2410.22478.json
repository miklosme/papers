  "title": "Designing robot swarms: a puzzle, a problem, and a mess",
  "abstract": "Swarm robotics is the study of how to design self-organized, autonomous groups of robots. In a robot swarm, coordinated collective behavior emerges from interactions among robots and between robots and their environment. Consequently, designing a robot swarm has traditionally been associated with identifying or engineering interaction rules to achieve a specific desired collective behavior.  We illustrate the varying complexity of designing robot swarms using a conceptual framework borrowed from organizational theory and systems thinking. Specifically, we examine the issue from the perspective of three levels of complexity: puzzle, problem, and mess. Originally outlined by Ackoff in the 1970s, this conceptual framework helps identify and express the complexity of an issue based on the number of intervening factors, its general formulation, and available solutions. In the following, we discuss how (i) the swarm robotics literature evolved by solving particular puzzles, (ii) recent advances in the automatic design of robot swarms are providing new tools to tackle a more general problem, and (iii) achieving large-scale robot swarms that operate in real-world scenarios is a mess.",
  "summary": "This paper discusses the increasing complexity of designing robot swarms, using the framework of puzzle, problem, and mess.  A \"puzzle\" is designing rules for basic collective behaviors (e.g., aggregation). A \"problem\" is automatically designing and optimizing these rules for specific tasks. The \"mess\" is deploying large-scale swarms in the real world, dealing with environmental interactions, other agents (including humans), safety, security, ethics, and regulations.\n\nFor LLM-based multi-agent systems, this translates to: starting with basic agent interactions (puzzle), moving towards automated design and optimization of agent behaviors for given tasks (problem), and ultimately tackling real-world deployment with its complex social and environmental considerations (mess).  Key relevant concepts include: automating design, lifelong learning, distributed situational awareness, human-agent interaction, safety/security, and ethical implications.",
  "takeaways": "This paper provides a valuable framework for JavaScript developers venturing into LLM-based multi-agent web applications. Let's translate the \"puzzle, problem, and mess\" framework into practical JavaScript examples:\n\n**1. The Puzzle (Simple, Defined Interactions):**\n\n* **Scenario:** Building a chat application where multiple LLM-powered chatbots interact with each other and a user in a controlled environment.  The goal is to have them collaborate on a creative writing task, like composing a short story.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * **LLM Integration:** Use a JavaScript library like `langchain` or a cloud provider's API for interacting with LLMs.\n    * **Agent Framework:**  Develop a simple agent class in JavaScript. Each agent has a role (e.g., narrator, character A, character B) and uses the LLM to generate its dialogue based on previous turns.\n    * **Interaction Rules:** Define clear rules for turn-taking and information sharing between agents. For instance, one agent might start the story, another continues it, and the third adds descriptive elements.  This could be managed by a central orchestrator function.\n* **Example:**\n\n```javascript\n// Simplified Agent class\nclass ChatbotAgent {\n  constructor(role, llm) {\n    this.role = role;\n    this.llm = llm;\n  }\n\n  async generateResponse(context) {\n    const prompt = `You are the ${this.role}.  Continue the story: ${context}`;\n    return await this.llm.generate(prompt); // Using langchain or similar\n  }\n}\n\n// ... Orchestrator logic to manage turn-taking ...\n```\n\n**2. The Problem (Complex, Goal-Oriented Behavior):**\n\n* **Scenario:** Creating a multi-agent system for a collaborative design tool.  LLM-powered agents assist users in generating design ideas, suggesting improvements, and automating repetitive tasks.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * **Reinforcement Learning:** Explore simple reinforcement learning techniques to optimize agent behavior towards a design goal (e.g., maximizing user satisfaction). This can be implemented using libraries like `ml5.js` or `brain.js`.\n    * **Advanced Agent Architecture:** Agents might have internal states and decision-making processes.  Consider using state machines or behavior trees (libraries like `machina.js` or custom implementations) to manage agent logic.\n    * **Decentralized Communication:** Implement message passing between agents using WebSockets or a message broker.\n* **Example:** Agents could receive rewards based on user feedback on their design suggestions, leading them to learn better design strategies over time.\n\n**3. The Mess (Real-World, Open Systems):**\n\n* **Scenario:** Building an LLM-powered multi-agent system for managing a smart home. Agents control different devices (lights, thermostat, security system), learning user preferences and adapting to changing conditions.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * **Robust Error Handling:**  Implement mechanisms to handle unexpected events and failures in the real world (e.g., a device going offline). This is crucial for a mess scenario.\n    * **Dynamic Adaptation:**  Use techniques like online learning to allow agents to adapt to changing user preferences and environmental conditions.\n    * **Security Considerations:** Implement security measures to protect the system from unauthorized access and malicious attacks.\n    * **Explainability:** Use tools or techniques to provide insights into agent decisions for the user.\n* **Example:**  An agent might learn that the user prefers a lower temperature at night and adjust the thermostat accordingly, or it might detect unusual activity and alert the security system.  JavaScript libraries for visualization (e.g., `D3.js`) could be used to explain agent decisions to the user.\n\n\n\n**Key JavaScript Technologies for Multi-Agent Development:**\n\n* **LLM Libraries:** `langchain`, Cloud Provider APIs (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).\n* **Agent Frameworks:** Custom implementations, `machina.js` (state machines).\n* **Communication:** WebSockets, message brokers (e.g., MQTT.js).\n* **Reinforcement Learning:** `ml5.js`, `brain.js`.\n* **Visualization:** `D3.js`, `Chart.js`.\n\n\n\nBy understanding the \"puzzle, problem, and mess\" framework, JavaScript developers can better plan, design, and implement robust and scalable LLM-based multi-agent systems for the web.  Start with simple puzzles, gradually increase complexity, and be prepared to address the challenges of real-world \"messes.\"",
