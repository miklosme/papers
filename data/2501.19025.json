  "title": "Recognize then Resolve: A Hybrid Framework for Understanding Interaction and Cooperative Conflict Resolution in Mixed Traffic",
  "abstract": "Abstract-A lack of understanding of interactions and the inability to effectively resolve conflicts continue to impede the progress of Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) in their interactions with Human-Driven Vehicles (HDVs). To address this challenge, we propose the Recognize then Resolve (RtR) framework. First, a Bilateral Intention Progression Graph (BIPG) is constructed based on CAV-HDV interaction data to model the evolution of interactions and identify potential HDV intentions. Three typical interaction breakdown scenarios are then categorized, and key moments are defined for triggering cooperative conflict resolution. On this basis, a constrained Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm is introduced to determine the optimal passage order while accommodating HDV intentions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RtR framework outperforms other cooperative approaches in terms of safety and efficiency across various penetration rates, achieving results close to consistent cooperation while significantly reducing computational resources. Our code and data are available at: https://github.com/FanGShiYuu/RtR-Recognize-then-Resolve/.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces the Recognize then Resolve (RtR) framework for improving the safety and efficiency of autonomous vehicles (CAVs) interacting with human-driven vehicles (HDVs) at intersections.  It addresses the challenge of CAVs understanding and reacting to unpredictable HDV behavior.\n\nRtR uses a Bilateral Intention Progression Graph (BIPG) to model the interaction dynamics and predict HDV intentions (rush or yield) based on real-time data like time-to-collision. When the BIPG detects potential interaction breakdowns (uncertain, inefficient, or dangerous), a constrained Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm determines the optimal passing order for all vehicles, respecting predicted HDV intentions.  This targeted cooperative decision-making improves safety and efficiency compared to always cooperating or relying solely on single-vehicle decision-making.  The focus on recognizing interaction patterns and incorporating predicted intentions is highly relevant to LLM-based multi-agent systems, where understanding and responding to complex agent interactions is crucial.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents valuable insights for JavaScript developers working on LLM-based multi-agent applications, especially in web development contexts like collaborative web apps, interactive simulations, and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). Hereâ€™s how developers can apply the RtR framework and related concepts:\n\n**1. Modeling Interaction Dynamics with BIPG (Bilateral Intention Progression Graph):**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine building a collaborative code editor where multiple users (agents) simultaneously edit the same document.  Conflicts can arise when two users modify the same code block.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**  Use a JavaScript graph library like `vis-network` or `sigma.js` to represent the BIPG. Nodes can represent agents (users), and edges can represent their interactions (code modifications). Each node can store LLM-generated predictions of user intent (e.g., \"edit function X,\" \"add new feature Y\"). The edge weights could represent the potential for conflict based on the predicted intentions and actions (e.g., simultaneous edits to the same lines of code).\n* **Conflict Detection:** Monitor changes in the graph structure and edge weights to detect potential conflicts (analogous to the \"uncertain,\" \"inefficient,\" and \"dangerous\" interaction scenarios in the paper). When a conflict threshold is reached, trigger the conflict resolution mechanism.\n\n**2. Constrained MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search) for Conflict Resolution:**\n\n* **Scenario:** In the collaborative code editor, when a conflict is detected, the system needs to decide which user's changes take precedence or how to merge the changes intelligently.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** Implement the MCTS algorithm in JavaScript.  Use the LLM-generated user intentions as constraints during the search for the optimal solution.  The reward function could consider factors like minimizing code disruption, preserving user intent, and maintaining code consistency. Libraries like `mcts.js` can provide a starting point, but you'll likely need to customize them for your specific needs.\n* **LLM Integration:** The LLM can assist in evaluating the quality of different solutions explored by MCTS. For instance, the LLM can assess the semantic correctness and potential bugs introduced by different merge strategies, informing the reward function.\n\n**3. HDV (Human-Driven Vehicle) Intention Modeling with LLMs:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  Consider a multi-agent web game where some agents are controlled by humans and others by AI. The AI agents need to anticipate and react to the human players' actions effectively.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** Use the LLM to model human player intentions based on their past actions and in-game communication.  Train the LLM on a dataset of human gameplay data to predict future moves and strategies. These predictions can then be used as input to the BIPG and the constrained MCTS.\n\n**4. Practical Considerations for Web Developers:**\n\n* **Client-Server Architecture:** Consider whether the multi-agent logic runs on the client (browser) or server. For complex simulations or real-time interactions, a server-side implementation might be more appropriate.\n* **WebSockets:** Use WebSockets for real-time communication between agents and the server in web applications.  This is crucial for dynamic updating of the BIPG and efficient conflict resolution.\n* **Visualization:** Use JavaScript visualization libraries like D3.js or Chart.js to display the BIPG, agent states, and conflict resolution progress to users, making the system more transparent and understandable.\n* **Performance Optimization:** Multi-agent systems can be computationally intensive.  Optimize your JavaScript code and consider using Web Workers for offloading computations to improve performance, especially in browser-based applications.\n\n\nBy combining the RtR framework with the power of LLMs and the flexibility of JavaScript, web developers can create innovative and intelligent multi-agent applications that handle complex interactions and resolve conflicts effectively in dynamic web environments.  This approach opens up exciting new possibilities for collaborative web apps, interactive simulations, and other multi-user web experiences.",
  "pseudocode": "The paper doesn't contain explicit pseudocode blocks, but the core algorithms are described mathematically and textually. Here's a JavaScript interpretation of the key algorithms:\n\n**1. Cooperative Acceleration Calculation:**\n\n```javascript\nfunction calculateCooperativeAcceleration(egoVehicle, opponentVehicle) {\n  const di = distance(opponentVehicle.position, intersectionPoint); // Distance between opponent and collision point\n  const vi = opponentVehicle.speed; // Opponent's current speed\n  const tcp_j = timeToCollisionPoint(egoVehicle, intersectionPoint); // Ego vehicle's TTCP\n\n  // Cooperative acceleration calculation (Eq. 2)\n  const ac = (2 * (di - vi * tcp_j)) / (tcp_j * tcp_j); \n  return ac;\n}\n\n// Helper functions\nfunction distance(pos1, pos2) { /* Calculate distance between two positions */ }\nfunction timeToCollisionPoint(vehicle, point) { /* Calculate TTCP */ }\n```\n\n* **Purpose:**  Quantifies the impact of a vehicle's actions on another during an interaction. It considers the distance to the potential collision point, speeds, and Time-To-Collision Point (TTCP).  This helps to assess the degree of cooperation or conflict between vehicles.\n\n**2. Intention Boundary Check (using SVM):**\n\n```javascript\nfunction predictIntention(egoVehicle, opponentVehicle, svmModel) {\n  const tcp_i = timeToCollisionPoint(opponentVehicle, intersectionPoint);\n  const tcp_j = timeToCollisionPoint(egoVehicle, intersectionPoint);\n  const ac_j = calculateCooperativeAcceleration(egoVehicle, opponentVehicle);\n\n  const features = [tcp_i, tcp_j, ac_j];  // Input features for the SVM\n  const prediction = svmModel.predict(features); // Use trained SVM model\n\n  if (prediction > 0) {\n    return \"rush\"; //  HDV intends to proceed first\n  } else {\n    return \"yield\"; // HDV intends to yield\n  }\n}\n```\n\n* **Purpose:** Predicts the intention (rush or yield) of an HDV using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The SVM model is trained offline using interaction data, and this function applies the model during real-time interactions. The features used are the TTCPs of both vehicles and the cooperative acceleration of the ego vehicle.\n\n**3. Constrained Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for Optimal Passing Order:**\n\n```javascript\nfunction constrainedMCTS(vehicles, hdvIntentions) {\n  let root = new Node(null, []);  // Root node with no parent and empty passing order\n\n  for (let i = 0; i < NUM_ITERATIONS; i++) { // MCTS iterations\n    let node = select(root);\n    if (!node.isFullyExpanded()) {\n       node = expand(node, vehicles);\n    }\n    const reward = simulate(node, vehicles, hdvIntentions);\n    backpropagate(node, reward);\n  }\n\n  return bestChild(root).passingOrder; // Return the best passing order found\n}\n\n\n// Helper functions (simplified for brevity):\nfunction select(node) { /* Tree traversal based on UCB1 (Eq. 5) */ }\nfunction expand(node, vehicles) { /* Adds a new child node with an extended passing order*/ }\nfunction simulate(node, vehicles, hdvIntentions) { /* Simulates interaction and calculates reward (Eq. 7) */ }\nfunction backpropagate(node, reward) { /* Updates statistics of nodes along the path */ }\nfunction bestChild(node) { /* Returns the child node with the highest average reward */ }\n\n\nclass Node {\n  constructor(parent, passingOrder) {\n    this.parent = parent;\n    this.passingOrder = passingOrder;\n    this.children = [];\n    this.visits = 0;\n    this.totalReward = 0;\n  }\n\n  isFullyExpanded() { /* Checks if all possible passing order extensions have been explored */ }\n}\n```\n\n* **Purpose:** This is the core conflict resolution algorithm. It uses MCTS to find the optimal passing order for vehicles at an intersection.  Crucially, it incorporates HDV intentions as constraints during the simulation phase, ensuring the generated passing order respects the predicted behavior of human drivers. The reward function penalizes solutions that violate HDV intentions.\n\n\nThese JavaScript snippets offer a simplified but functional interpretation of the algorithms described in the paper.  A real-world implementation would require more detailed helper functions, proper integration with a traffic simulator or real-time data stream, a trained SVM model, and parameter tuning. However, they provide a good starting point for JavaScript developers interested in exploring multi-agent AI for cooperative driving.",
