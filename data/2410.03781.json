  "title": "Towards the Pedagogical Steering of Large Language Models for Tutoring: A Case Study with Modeling Productive Failure",
  "abstract": "One-to-one tutoring is one of the most efficient methods of teaching. Following the rise in popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs), there have been efforts to use them to create conversational tutoring systems, which can make the benefits of one-to-one tutoring accessible to everyone. However, current LLMs are primarily trained to be helpful assistants and thus lack crucial pedagogical skills. For example, they often quickly reveal the solution to the student and fail to plan for a richer multi-turn pedagogical interaction. To use LLMs in pedagogical scenarios, they need to be steered towards using effective teaching strategies: a problem we introduce as Pedagogical Steering and believe to be crucial for the efficient use of LLMs as tutors. We address this problem by formalizing a concept of tutoring strategy, and introducing StratL, an algorithm to model a strategy and use prompting to steer the LLM to follow this strategy. As a case study, we create a prototype tutor for high school math following Productive Failure (PF), an advanced and effective learning design. To validate our approach in a real-world setting, we run a field study with 17 high school students in Singapore. We quantitatively show that StratL succeeds in steering the LLM to follow a Productive Failure tutoring strategy. We also thoroughly investigate the existence of spillover effects on desirable properties of the LLM, like its ability to generate human-like answers. Based on these results, we highlight the challenges in Pedagogical Steering and suggest opportunities for further improvements. We further encourage follow-up research by releasing a dataset of Productive Failure problems and the code of our prototype and algorithm.",
  "summary": "This research paper explores how to make Large Language Models (LLMs) better tutors by controlling their conversational strategies. \n\nKey points for LLM-based multi-agent systems:\n\n* **LLMs lack inherent pedagogical skills:** They're better at giving satisfying answers than promoting learning.\n* **The paper introduces StratL:** An algorithm that guides LLMs to follow effective teaching strategies over multiple conversation turns.\n* **StratL uses \"tutoring intents\":** Specific goals like giving hints or encouraging deeper thinking, which are then translated into prompts for the LLM. \n* **Focus on \"Productive Failure\":** A teaching method where students explore solutions before being taught, which goes against LLM's natural inclination to provide answers directly.\n* **Promising results, but limitations:**  StratL successfully steered LLMs toward the desired teaching style, but more work is needed on intent selection and social/scalability aspects.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents exciting possibilities for JavaScript developers working with LLMs in multi-agent web applications. Let's break down how you can use its insights:\n\n**1. Building Pedagogical Chatbots:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine building an interactive coding tutorial website using Node.js. Instead of just providing static content, you want an LLM-powered agent that guides learners through exercises using the Productive Failure (PF) approach.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * **State Tracing:** Use a JavaScript library like `natural` to process learner messages, identify errors (syntax, logical, conceptual), requests for help, and even sentiment.\n    * **Intent Selection:**  Implement the paper's PF-inspired transition graph (see Figure 4 in the paper) using a JavaScript library like `xstate` to manage the chatbot's tutoring strategy dynamically based on learner states.\n    * **Intent-Dependent Steering:**  Craft dynamic prompts for your LLM (e.g., using OpenAI API) using template literals. For example, if the learner makes a logical error, the prompt could be: `\"You're on the right track, but there's a slight flaw in your logic. Can you think of any edge cases where your code might not behave as expected?\"`.  \n    * **Framework:** Consider using a conversational AI framework like `Botpress` or `Rasa` which often have built-in functionalities for state management and intent recognition, making your integration smoother.\n\n**2. Collaborative Problem-Solving Environments:**\n\n* **Scenario:** You're building a collaborative design platform where teams brainstorm solutions (like Figma but with AI). You want LLM agents to facilitate, not dictate, the process, encouraging exploration.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * **Agent Roles:** Define different agent roles with specialized pedagogical strategies (e.g., \"Challenger,\" \"Clarifier,\" \"Synthesizer\") using the paper's taxonomy of tutoring intents (Table 3).\n    * **Turn-Taking & Orchestration:** Employ a JavaScript library like `Socket.IO` for real-time communication between agents and the web interface. Use a queue system to manage agent turn-taking, prompting them based on the conversation's state. \n    * **Visualizing Solution Spaces:** As users interact, use a JavaScript visualization library like `D3.js` to represent the different solution paths (RSMs) being explored, making the design process more transparent.\n\n**3. Personalized Learning Paths:**\n\n* **Scenario:** You're building an e-learning platform with LLM-powered tutors for different subjects. You want to personalize the learning journey for each student.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * **Student Modeling:** Track student performance, learning styles, and preferences using JavaScript and store the data (consider `localStorage` or a server-side database).\n    * **Adaptive Intent Selection:**  Adjust the tutoring strategy (and thus the prompted intents) based on the student model. For example, a struggling student might need more scaffolding (\"Hint\" intents), while a fast learner could benefit from more challenging \"Identify Limits\" prompts.\n\n**Key Takeaways for JavaScript Developers:**\n\n* **LLMs are tools, not teachers (yet):** This paper highlights that simply using an LLM for tutoring won't lead to effective learning. You need to guide them with a pedagogical strategy.\n* **Think in multi-turn dialogues:**  Plan your LLM interactions as multi-turn conversations.  Don't just focus on single-turn responses.\n* **Experiment with the paper's insights:** Use the provided transition graph, intent taxonomy, and prompt engineering techniques as starting points for your own projects.\n\nBy combining the power of LLMs with thoughtful pedagogical design and JavaScript's versatility, you can create the next generation of engaging, effective, and truly interactive web applications!",
