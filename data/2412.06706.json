  "title": "Asynchronous Agents with Perfect Recall: Model Reductions, Knowledge-Based Construction, and Model Checking for Coalitional Strategies",
  "abstract": "Model checking of strategic abilities for agents with memory is a notoriously hard problem, and very few attempts have been made to tackle it. In this paper, we present two important steps towards this goal. First, we take the partial-order reduction scheme that was recently proved to preserve individual and coalitional abilities of memoryless agents, and show that it also works for agents with memory. Secondly, we take the Knowledge-Based Subset Construction, that was recently studied for synchronous concurrent games, and adapt it to preserve abilities of memoryful agents in asynchronous MAS. On the way, we also propose a new execution semantics for strategies in asynchronous MAS, that combines elements of Concurrent Game Structures and Interleaved Interpreted Systems in a natural and intuitive way.",
  "summary": "This paper tackles the challenge of verifying strategic abilities in multi-agent systems where agents have memory of past interactions, particularly focusing on asynchronous communication.  It adapts and extends existing techniques like Knowledge-Based Subset Construction and Partial Order Reduction to handle imperfect information and memory. This allows for translating a complex problem (agents with memory) into a simpler one (memoryless agents in an expanded model) and shrinking the model size while preserving key properties. These advancements are relevant for verifying the correctness and security of complex multi-agent web applications where LLMs could act as reasoning engines for individual agents. The ability to verify strategic properties within these systems, especially for agents with recall (like LLMs which maintain conversation history), provides a powerful tool for ensuring dependable and secure application behavior.",
  "takeaways": "This research paper presents valuable insights for JavaScript developers working with LLM-based multi-agent systems, particularly in asynchronous web environments. Here are some practical examples of how its concepts can be applied:\n\n**1. Modeling Asynchronous Interactions with i/o-iCGS:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  Building a collaborative web editor where multiple users (agents) interact with a shared document. Each user's actions (e.g., typing, formatting) are asynchronous events.\n* **Application:**  Represent the editor's logic as an i/o-iCGS using a JavaScript library like `graphlib` or a custom implementation.  Each node in the graph represents a global state (the combined document state and user states), while edges represent transitions labeled with user choices (input) and resulting document changes (output). This helps manage the complexity of asynchronous interactions, especially with eventual consistency considerations common in collaborative web apps.\n* **Code Example (Conceptual):**\n```javascript\n// Example i/o-iCGS node representation\nconst node = {\n  documentState: \"...\",\n  user1State: { cursorPosition: 10, selection: null },\n  user2State: { cursorPosition: 25, selection: \"hello\" },\n};\n\n// Example i/o-iCGS edge representation\nconst edge = {\n  source: node1,\n  target: node2,\n  input: { user1: \"type 'a'\", user2: \"delete 'o'\" },\n  output: \"document updated\",\n};\n```\n\n**2. Implementing Knowledge-Based Strategies:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Developing a multi-player online game where agents have imperfect information about other players' states.\n* **Application:**  Use the Knowledge-Based Subset Construction (KBSC) to create individual \"knowledge states\" for each agent.  This can be implemented in JavaScript by maintaining a set of possible game states consistent with each agent's observations. LLMs can enhance this by reasoning about potential hidden states and strategies based on limited information.  This allows you to develop more sophisticated agent behaviors that account for uncertainty.\n* **Example:** In a card game, an agent's knowledge state might include all possible hands other players could have, given the cards already played and the agent's own hand.\n\n**3. Leveraging Partial Order Reduction (POR):**\n\n* **Scenario:**  Simulating a complex web application with many asynchronous components, like microservices communicating via message queues.\n* **Application:** POR can significantly reduce the complexity of model checking and simulation. In JavaScript, you can implement POR by selectively exploring execution paths that are relevant to the properties being verified, ignoring interleavings of independent events that don't affect the overall outcome. This can be especially useful for testing responsiveness and fault tolerance of asynchronous systems.\n* **Example:** If two users are editing different parts of a document simultaneously, POR can treat their actions as independent, simplifying the simulation and making debugging more efficient.  LLMs can further be used to predict independent events for efficient filtering.\n\n**4. Combining with LLM Reasoning:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Building a chatbot system where multiple LLM-powered agents interact with a user to fulfill complex requests.\n* **Application:** Combine the formal methods from the paper with the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Use the i/o-iCGS to structure agent interactions, and use LLMs to generate agent strategies based on their knowledge states, the current dialog context, and potential future actions. This allows building more robust and effective multi-agent conversational AI systems.\n* **Example:**  An LLM can be used to decide which agent should respond to a user query based on its expertise and the information available in the current dialog state (represented as a node in the i/o-iCGS).\n\n**JavaScript Libraries and Frameworks:**\n\n* **`graphlib`:**  For representing and manipulating i/o-iCGSs.\n* **`LangChain` & `LlamaIndex`:** For integrating LLMs into agent logic and strategy generation.\n* **Custom implementations:** JavaScript allows the flexibility to implement KBSC and POR algorithms tailored to specific application requirements.\n\nBy understanding and applying the principles of this research paper, JavaScript developers can build more sophisticated, efficient, and reliable LLM-based multi-agent systems for web applications and beyond.  It enables a bridge between formal verification approaches and the power of LLMs, paving the way for more robust and trustworthy agent behaviors in web development.",
  "pseudocode": "The paper includes algorithmic descriptions, but they are presented as numbered steps rather than traditional pseudocode blocks. Here's a JavaScript representation along with explanations:\n\n**1. Knowledge-Based Subset Construction (Expansion):**\n\nThis algorithm constructs the knowledge-based expansion of a projected model for an agent. It essentially explores all reachable knowledge states for the agent, considering their imperfect information and possible transitions.\n\n```javascript\nfunction expand(initialState, transitions, equivalenceRelation, repertoire) {\n  let knowledgeStates = [eClosure([initialState], transitions)]; // Initial knowledge state\n  let transitionsK = [];\n\n  while (true) {\n    let addedNewState = false;\n\n    for (const knowledgeState of knowledgeStates) {\n      for (const choice of repertoire(knowledgeState)) {        \n        let successors = [];\n        for (const state of knowledgeState) {\n          for (const [q, e, a, qPrime] of transitions) {\n            if (state === q && choice === e) {\n              successors.push(qPrime);\n            }\n          }\n        }\n\n        let successorsPrime = eClosure(successors, transitions);\n        let successorsK = quotientSet(successorsPrime, equivalenceRelation); // Partition by ~i\n\n        for (const succK of successorsK) {\n          if (!knowledgeStates.includes(succK)) { // Add new knowledge states\n            knowledgeStates.push(succK);\n            addedNewState = true;\n          }\n\n           // Add new transitions to the expanded model\n          for (const q of knowledgeState) {\n            for (const qPrime of succK) {\n              for (const a of getEventsForTransition(q, choice, qPrime, transitions)) {\n                transitionsK.push([knowledgeState, a, succK]);\n              }\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\n    if (!addedNewState) break;\n  }\n\n  return [knowledgeStates, transitionsK];\n}\n\n// Helper functions\nfunction eClosure(states, transitions) {  \n   let closure = [...states];\n   let changed = true;\n   while(changed) {\n       changed = false;\n       for (const [q, e, a, qPrime] of transitions) {\n           if (closure.includes(q) && a === 'e' && !closure.includes(qPrime)) {\n               closure.push(qPrime);\n               changed = true;\n           }\n       }\n   }\n   return closure;\n}\n\n\nfunction quotientSet(set, equivalenceRelation) {\n  // Implementation of quotient set creation based on equivalenceRelation\n  // ... (This depends on how the equivalence relation is represented)\n}\n\nfunction getEventsForTransition(q, choice, qPrime, transitions) {\n  let events = [];\n  for (const [state, e, a, nextState] of transitions) {\n     if (q === state && choice === e && qPrime === nextState && a !== 'e') {\n         events.push(a);\n     }\n  }\n  return events;\n}\n\n```\n\n\n\n**2. Partial Order Reduction:**\n\nThis algorithm modifies Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore a smaller portion of the state space while preserving relevant properties related to the formula and agent coalition being considered. It uses conditions C1, C2, and C3 to select a subset of enabled events for expansion.\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction reducedDFS(initialState, enabled, independentEvents, visibleEvents) {\n  let visited = new Set();\n  let reducedModelTransitions = [];\n\n  function dfs(state) {\n    visited.add(state);\n\n    let availableEvents = enabled(state);\n    let selectedEvents = selectSubset(state, availableEvents, independentEvents, visibleEvents);\n\n\n    for (const event of selectedEvents) {\n       let nextState = getNextState(state, event, enabled)\n       if (nextState && !visited.has(nextState)) {\n         reducedModelTransitions.push([state, event, nextState]);\n         dfs(nextState);\n       }\n    }\n  }\n\n\n  dfs(initialState);\n  return reducedModelTransitions;\n}\n\nfunction selectSubset(state, availableEvents, independentEvents, visibleEvents) {\n    // Implements conditions C1, C2, C3 from the paper\n    // ...  This is the core of the POR optimization and requires careful implementation\n    // to ensure correctness. The specific implementation will depend on how dependencies,\n    // invisibility, and enabled events are represented.\n}\n\n\nfunction getNextState(state, event, enabled) {\n    // Finds the next state based on the given state and event\n    for (const e of enabled(state)) {\n        if(event.out === e.out && equalSets(event.in, e.in)) {\n            return e.nextState;\n        }\n    }\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction equalSets(set1, set2) {\n     if(set1.size !== set2.size) return false;\n     for (const item of set1) {\n         if(!set2.has(item)) return false;\n     }\n     return true;\n}\n\n```\n\nThese JavaScript adaptations provide a more concrete basis for implementing the concepts from the paper.  Remember that the helper functions and the core logic of `selectSubset` would need further development based on the specific details of your multi-agent system representation.  The paper's formal definitions would guide the implementation of these missing parts.",
