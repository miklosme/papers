  "title": "Improving Mixed-Criticality Scheduling with Reinforcement Learning",
  "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel reinforcement learning (RL) approach to scheduling mixed-criticality (MC) systems on processors with varying speeds. Building upon the foundation laid by [1], we extend their work to address the non-preemptive scheduling problem, which is known to be NP-hard. By modeling this scheduling challenge as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), we develop an RL agent capable of generating near-optimal schedules for real-time MC systems. Our RL-based scheduler prioritizes high-critical tasks while maintaining overall system performance. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach. The RL scheduler significantly improves task completion rates, achieving around 80% overall and 85% for high-criticality tasks across 100,000 instances of synthetic data and real data under varying system conditions. Moreover, under stable conditions without degradation, the scheduler achieves 94% overall task completion and 93% for high-criticality tasks. These results highlight the potential of RL-based schedulers in real-time and safety-critical applications, offering substantial improvements in handling complex and dynamic scheduling scenarios.",
  "summary": "This paper explores using reinforcement learning (RL) to schedule tasks with different criticality levels (e.g., high-priority flight control vs. low-priority video rendering) on processors that can vary in speed.  It focuses on the difficult \"non-preemptive\" scheduling problem, where tasks cannot be interrupted once started.\n\nWhile not explicitly about LLMs, the use of an RL agent to make complex scheduling decisions in a dynamic environment is relevant to LLM-based multi-agent systems.  The paper highlights how an RL agent can learn to balance competing priorities (high vs. low criticality tasks) under changing conditions (processor speed), which is directly analogous to coordinating actions among multiple LLM agents with different objectives.  The focus on non-preemptive scheduling could also inform scenarios where LLM actions have irreversible consequences.",
  "takeaways": "This paper explores using Reinforcement Learning (RL) for scheduling mixed-criticality tasks, a concept applicable to LLM-based multi-agent web apps.  Let's translate the insights into practical JavaScript examples:\n\n**1. Prioritizing LLM Agent Actions:**\n\nImagine a multi-agent web app where agents manage different tasks:\n* **High-Criticality:**  Real-time chat moderation for harmful content, requiring immediate responses (using an LLM for content analysis).\n* **Low-Criticality:**  Sentiment analysis of user feedback, which can be delayed slightly (also using an LLM).\n\nUsing the paper's concept, you can prioritize high-criticality agent actions.  When the system is under load (analogous to the paper's \"degradation\"),  prioritize the chat moderation agent's LLM calls.\n\n```javascript\n// Simplified example using a priority queue\nconst priorityQueue = new PriorityQueue();\n\n// Add agent actions with priority (lower number = higher priority)\npriorityQueue.enqueue({ agent: 'chatModeration', action: 'analyzeText', text: '...' }, 1);\npriorityQueue.enqueue({ agent: 'sentimentAnalysis', action: 'analyzeText', text: '...' }, 2);\n\n// Process actions based on priority\nwhile (!priorityQueue.isEmpty()) {\n  const { agent, action, text } = priorityQueue.dequeue();\n  // Call LLM for the agent action (e.g., using LangChain or a custom API)\n  const llmResponse = await callLLM(agent, action, text);\n  // ... process LLM response ...\n}\n```\n\nLibraries like `priorityqueue.js` can implement this in JavaScript.  You could dynamically adjust priorities based on system load or other factors.\n\n**2.  Degradation Handling in LLM-based Apps:**\n\n\"Degradation\" in the paper can translate to several scenarios in web apps:\n* **LLM API Rate Limits:**  Exceeding the LLM API's request limits.\n* **Network Latency:**  Slow network connections affecting LLM response times.\n* **Server Load:** High traffic impacting server performance and LLM execution.\n\nThe paper's strategy of maintaining high-criticality tasks under degradation can be applied here.  If your app hits API rate limits, you might provide simplified LLM responses for low-criticality tasks or queue them for later processing, ensuring that critical tasks continue to function.\n\n```javascript\nasync function handleLLMCall(agent, action, text) {\n  try {\n    const llmResponse = await callLLM(agent, action, text);\n    return llmResponse;\n  } catch (error) {\n    if (error.code === 'RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED' && agent === 'sentimentAnalysis') { // Low-criticality agent\n       return { simplifiedResponse: true, sentiment: 'neutral' }; //  Fallback simplified response\n    } else {\n      throw error; // Re-throw for critical agents or other errors\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**3.  Multi-Agent Coordination using a JavaScript Framework:**\n\nFrameworks like `Machinomy` or `LangChain` (with its agent capabilities) can be used to manage the actions and communication of multiple LLM-powered agents in your web application.  You can implement scheduling logic within the framework to orchestrate the agents based on their priorities and the current system state.  \n\n**4.  Simulating and Experimenting:**\n\nJavaScript allows you to simulate the scenarios discussed in the paper.  You can create mock LLM agents, simulate varying levels of system load, and test different scheduling algorithms to observe their impact on task completion and overall performance.  This allows you to fine-tune your multi-agent system before deploying it to a production environment.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe paper's insights into mixed-criticality task scheduling offer valuable guidance for building robust LLM-based multi-agent web applications.  Prioritization queues, degradation handling strategies, and multi-agent frameworks, all implemented in JavaScript, can help ensure your applications perform reliably even under challenging conditions.  The ability to simulate various scenarios in JavaScript enables experimentation and optimization of your multi-agent system for real-world deployment.",
