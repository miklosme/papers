  "title": "Spiking Neural Networks as a Controller for Emergent Swarm Agents",
  "abstract": "Abstract-Drones which can swarm and loiter in a certain area cost hundreds of dollars, but mosquitos can do the same and are essentially worthless. To control swarms of low-cost robots, researchers may end up spending countless hours brainstorming robot configurations and policies to \"organically\" create behaviors which do not need expensive sensors and perception. Existing research explores the possible emergent behaviors in swarms of robots with only a binary sensor and a simple but hand-picked controller structure. Even agents in this highly limited sensing, actuation, and computational capability class can exhibit relatively complex global behaviors such as aggregation, milling, and dispersal, but finding the local interaction rules that enable more collective behaviors remains a significant challenge. This paper investigates the feasibility of training spiking neural networks to find those local interaction rules that result in particular emergent behaviors. In this paper, we focus on simulating a specific milling behavior already known to be producible using very simple binary sensing and acting agents. To do this, we use evolutionary algorithms to evolve not only the parameters (the weights, biases, and delays) of a spiking neural network, but also its structure. To create a baseline, we also show an evolutionary search strategy over the parameters for the incumbent hand-picked binary controller structure. Our simulations show that spiking neural networks can be evolved in binary sensing agents to form a mill.\nIndex Terms-Spiking Neural Networks, Evolutionary algorithms, Swarming Behaviors.",
  "summary": "This research investigates using spiking neural networks (SNNs) to control swarms of simple robots with limited sensing capabilities.  The goal is to achieve complex emergent behavior (like milling in a circle) by optimizing the SNN's structure and parameters through an evolutionary algorithm. \n\nWhile not directly using LLMs, the paper's focus on evolving communication and behavior in resource-constrained agents using minimal sensing directly applies to LLM-based multi-agent system development.  It highlights the potential for using similar evolutionary approaches to develop sophisticated multi-agent interactions without relying on extensive pre-defined rules or complex individual agent capabilities.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents exciting possibilities for JavaScript developers working with LLMs in multi-agent systems, especially when limited by simple communication protocols or constrained hardware. Hereâ€™s how you can apply these insights:\n\n**1. Simulating Emergent Behavior in Web Applications**\n\n* Imagine building a collaborative web game where user-controlled agents (represented by LLM-powered bots) interact on a canvas. Each agent could have a limited understanding of its surroundings (like the binary sensors in the paper) and communicate with others through simple messages.\n* Use JavaScript libraries like `p5.js` or `Phaser` to create a visual simulation environment. \n* Instead of hardcoding complex interaction rules, use an evolutionary algorithm (like NEAT or a genetic algorithm implemented in a library like `geneticalgorithm`) to evolve the LLM prompts. \n* The fitness function could reward agents for achieving a desired global behavior (like forming a specific pattern or collaboratively solving a puzzle).\n\n**JavaScript Implementation Snippet (Conceptual):**\n\n```javascript\n// Define a simple agent with an LLM prompt and basic actions\nclass Agent {\n  constructor(prompt) {\n    this.llm = new LLM(prompt); // Your LLM integration here\n    this.position = { x: 0, y: 0 };\n  }\n\n  act(observation) {\n    let action = this.llm.generate(observation); // LLM suggests an action\n    // ... (update position based on action)\n  }\n}\n\n// Initialize a population of agents with different prompts\nlet population = [];\nfor (let i = 0; i < populationSize; i++) {\n  population.push(new Agent(generateRandomPrompt()));\n}\n\n// ... (Run the simulation, evaluate fitness, and evolve the prompts)\n```\n\n**2. Decentralized Decision-Making in Web Apps**\n\n* Consider a web application for managing a delivery fleet. Each driver (agent) can only communicate with nearby drivers and has limited information about the overall traffic situation. \n*  You could use an LLM to power each agent's decision-making process (e.g., choosing routes, responding to delays).\n* The evolutionary approach from the paper could be applied to optimize the LLM's prompts or fine-tune its parameters over time, leading to better global efficiency in terms of delivery times and fuel consumption.\n\n**3.  Enhancing User Interfaces with SNNs**\n\n* While the paper focuses on agent control, SNNs can also process real-time user interaction data (mouse movements, clicks, scrolling) to predict user intent or personalize UI elements. \n* Libraries like `Synaptic.js` or `brain.js` can be used to experiment with SNNs in the browser.\n\n**Key Takeaways for JavaScript Developers:**\n\n* **Emergent behavior** is powerful:  You can achieve complex system-level behavior by defining simple local interactions between LLM-powered agents.\n* **Evolutionary algorithms** are your friends:  They can help you find optimal LLM prompts and parameters, even with non-differentiable or complex reward functions. \n* **SNNs offer intriguing possibilities:** Though early, they can be explored for real-time data processing in web applications.\n\nThis paper encourages you to move beyond traditional, centralized AI approaches. By embracing the principles of multi-agent systems and evolutionary computation, you can unlock new possibilities for building more intelligent, adaptive, and robust web applications.",
