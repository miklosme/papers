  "title": "Collaborative State Fusion in Partially Known Multi-agent Environments",
  "abstract": "Abstract-In this paper, we study the collaborative state fusion problem in a multi-agent environment, where mobile agents collaborate to track movable targets. Due to the limited sensing range and potential errors of on-board sensors, it is necessary to aggregate individual observations to provide target state fusion for better target state estimation. Existing schemes do not perform well due to (1) impractical assumption of the fully known prior target state-space model and (2) observation outliers from individual sensors. To address the issues, we propose a two-stage collaborative fusion framework, namely Learnable Weighted Robust Fusion (LoF). LoF combines a local state estimator (e.g., Kalman Filter) with a learnable weight generator to address the mismatch between the prior state-space model and underlying patterns of moving targets. Moreover, given observation outliers, we develop a time-series soft medoid(TSM) scheme to perform robust fusion. We evaluate LoF in a collaborative detection simulation environment with promising results. In an example setting with 4 agents and 2 targets, LoF leads to a 9.1% higher fusion gain compared to the state-of-the-art.",
  "summary": "- The research tackles the problem of combining information from multiple AI agents (like sensors) to accurately track moving targets, even when the agents have limited and potentially faulty data.\n- It proposes LoF, a two-stage framework where agents first estimate target states individually, then a central process combines these estimates robustly, even with errors or inconsistencies. LoF learns to weigh agents' estimates based on their past reliability, making it adaptable to changing conditions. This is relevant to LLM-based systems where agents could be LLMs processing and interpreting complex data, with LoF ensuring reliable combined conclusions.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents a novel approach to robustly fuse state estimates in multi-agent systems, particularly useful for JavaScript developers building LLM-based web applications where agents need to collaborate effectively. Let's dive into practical examples:\n\n**Scenario:** Collaborative Code Editor\n\nImagine building a collaborative code editor like Google Docs but powered by LLMs. Multiple developers (agents) simultaneously edit code, each with an LLM agent predicting their next actions and suggesting completions. \n\n**Challenge:** Each LLM agent might have slightly different predictions about the code's future state (e.g., variable values, function calls).  Naive averaging of these predictions could lead to inaccurate results, especially if one LLM has a faulty prediction (outlier).\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Local State Estimation:** Each developer's browser runs an instance of a JavaScript LLM library like `TensorFlow.js`. This locally processes code changes and uses the LLM to predict the code's future state, represented as a probability distribution (mean and uncertainty).\n\n2. **Local Weight Generation:** Implement the paper's Local Weight Generator (Fig 3a) using a small neural network in `TensorFlow.js`. This network takes the local LLM's prediction (mean, uncertainty) and assesses its agreement with the history of code edits. A well-aligned prediction receives higher weight.\n\n3. **Centralized Robust Fusion (Server-Side):** A Node.js server aggregates local predictions and their weights. Instead of simple averaging, implement the Time-Series Soft Medoid (TSM) using a library like `Math.js`. TSM handles outliers gracefully, leading to a more robust fused prediction of the code's state. This fused prediction is then broadcasted back to clients for better code completion and suggestion.\n\n**JavaScript Frameworks/Libraries:**\n\n* **TensorFlow.js:** For running LLM inference and training small neural networks in the browser.\n* **Node.js:** For server-side aggregation and robust fusion logic.\n* **Math.js:** For matrix operations and implementing TSM.\n* **Socket.IO:**  For real-time communication between clients and the server.\n\n**Other Web Development Applications:**\n\n* **Multi-User Design Tools:** In Figma-like applications, multiple users could collaboratively design interfaces, with LLMs assisting each user. LoF ensures design consistency despite variations in individual LLM outputs.\n* **Real-Time Strategy Games:** In browser-based strategy games, multiple players (or AI agents) could leverage LLMs to strategize. LoF enables robust decision-making based on the aggregated and refined predictions of individual LLMs.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nBy implementing LoF's principles, JavaScript developers can build more robust and reliable LLM-based multi-agent web applications, paving the way for a new era of intelligent and collaborative online experiences.",
  "pseudocode": "```javascript\nconst { Optimizer, losses } = require('@tensorflow/tfjs'); \n\n// Assuming a suitable neural network model 'MLP' for local weight generation is defined\n// ...\n\nfunction trainLoFModel(dataset, model, batchSize, horizonLength) {\n  const optimizer = new Optimizer(); // Choose a suitable optimizer, e.g., Adam\n  model.compile({ loss: losses.meanSquaredError, optimizer: optimizer }); \n\n  for (let iteration = 0; iteration < maxIterations; iteration++) {\n    const batchData = dataset.getBatch(batchSize); // Assuming a method to fetch batches\n    \n    for (let t = 0; t < horizonLength; t++) {\n      const batchLoss = []; \n      for (const trajectory of batchData) {\n        const { localStates, localWeights, fusionState, observation } = processTrajectory(trajectory, t);\n        // 'processTrajectory' function (not shown here) would handle:\n        // - Iterating through each agent in the trajectory.\n        // - Estimating local states (e.g., using KF) and weights using the model ('MLP').\n        // - Performing robust fusion to get the 'fusionState'.\n\n        const loss = model.fit(observation, localWeights); // Train the model to predict local weights\n        batchLoss.push(loss);\n      }\n      \n      // Update model parameters based on the average loss over the batch\n      const averageLoss = tf.mean(batchLoss);\n      optimizer.minimize(() => averageLoss); \n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThis JavaScript code implements the training process for the Learnable Weighted Robust Fusion (LoF) model as described in the research paper. Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - It imports necessary components from TensorFlow.js.\n   - It assumes you have a defined neural network model 'MLP' for local weight generation.\n   - It initializes an optimizer (e.g., Adam).\n   - It compiles the model with a mean squared error loss function.\n\n2. **Training Loop:**\n   - It iterates over a specified number of training iterations (`maxIterations`).\n   - In each iteration, it fetches a batch of data from the dataset.\n   - It then loops through each time step in the horizon.\n\n3. **Processing Each Trajectory:**\n   - For each trajectory in the batch:\n     - It calls a `processTrajectory` function (not defined in the provided snippet). This function is responsible for:\n       - Iterating through each agent in the trajectory.\n       - Using a state estimator (like Kalman Filter) to estimate the local state of the target for each agent.\n       - Using the neural network model `MLP` to generate local weights based on observations and previous fusion states.\n       - Performing robust fusion (using TSM) to get the fused state estimate. \n     - The `processTrajectory` function would return:\n       - `localStates`: An array of local state estimates for all agents in the trajectory.\n       - `localWeights`: An array of local weights predicted by the `MLP` for all agents.\n       - `fusionState`: The final fused state estimate obtained after robust fusion (TSM). \n       - `observation`: The observation data for the current time step.\n\n4. **Loss Calculation and Optimization:**\n   - It calculates the loss by comparing predicted local weights (`localWeights`) with those obtained from the `processTrajectory` function using the specified loss function.\n   - It updates the `MLP` model's parameters using the optimizer based on the calculated loss.\n\n5. **Model Update:**\n   - The model's parameters are updated after processing each batch of trajectories.\n\n**Purpose:**\n\nThis algorithm aims to train the neural network model (`MLP`) within the LoF framework. The `MLP` learns to predict the local weights for each agent's state estimate based on its observations and the previous fusion state. The goal is to optimize these weights so that the robust fusion process, using TSM, produces the most accurate and robust target state estimate, especially in the presence of noisy observations or uncertainties in the system.",
