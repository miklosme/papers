  "title": "Relational Weight Optimization for Enhancing Team Performance in Multi-Agent Multi-Armed Bandits",
  "abstract": "Abstract:\nWe introduce an approach to improve team performance in a Multi-Agent Multi-Armed Bandit (MAMAB) framework using Fastest Mixing Markov Chain (FMMC) and Fastest Distributed Linear Averaging (FDLA) optimization algorithms. The multi-agent team is represented using a fixed relational network and simulated using the Coop-UCB2 algorithm. The edge weights of the communication network directly impact the time taken to reach distributed consensus. Our goal is to shrink the timescale on which the convergence of the consensus occurs to achieve optimal team performance and maximize reward. Through our experiments, we show that the convergence to team consensus occurs slightly faster in large constrained networks.",
  "summary": "This paper explores optimizing communication in multi-agent reinforcement learning (specifically Multi-Agent Multi-Armed Bandits or MAMABs) by adjusting the weights of connections in the agent network.  It aims to speed up consensus among agents about the best action to take in an uncertain environment, improving overall team performance.\n\nFor LLM-based multi-agent systems, this research highlights the importance of efficient communication network topologies for achieving faster convergence on optimal solutions.  Optimizing the flow of information (analogous to edge weights) between LLMs acting as agents could significantly impact how quickly they reach agreement and effectively collaborate.",
  "takeaways": "This paper explores optimizing communication within a multi-agent system for faster convergence on optimal solutions, particularly relevant for LLM-based agents in web applications.  Let's translate its insights into practical JavaScript examples:\n\n**Scenario:** Imagine building a collaborative writing web app using LLMs. Multiple agents (each representing a user or an AI assistant) contribute to a shared document. They need to reach a consensus on style, tone, and content suggestions.\n\n**1. Representing the Agent Network:**\n\n```javascript\n// Adjacency matrix representing connections between 4 agents\nconst adjacencyMatrix = [\n  [0, 1, 1, 0],\n  [1, 0, 1, 1],\n  [1, 1, 0, 1],\n  [0, 1, 1, 0]\n];\n\n// Convert to a graph data structure (e.g., using a library like vis.js or Cytoscape.js)\nconst nodes = [\n  { id: 1, label: 'Agent 1' },\n  { id: 2, label: 'Agent 2' },\n  { id: 3, label: 'Agent 3' },\n  { id: 4, label: 'Agent 4' },\n];\nconst edges = [];\nfor (let i = 0; i < adjacencyMatrix.length; i++) {\n  for (let j = i + 1; j < adjacencyMatrix[i].length; j++) {\n    if (adjacencyMatrix[i][j] === 1) {\n      edges.push({ from: i + 1, to: j + 1 });\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nconst graph = { nodes, edges }; \n```\n\n**2. Implementing Consensus with Optimized Weights:**\n\nThe paper focuses on optimizing the `P` (Perron) matrix, which dictates how agents influence each other.  We can use libraries like `math.js` for matrix operations.  While directly calculating FMMC/FDLA solutions can be complex, we can start with heuristics and experiment with simpler optimization approaches later on.\n\n```javascript\nimport * as math from 'mathjs';\n\n// Example: Maximum-degree weights (as described in the paper)\nfunction getMaxDegreeWeights(adjacencyMatrix) {\n  let maxDegree = 0;\n  for (const row of adjacencyMatrix) {\n    maxDegree = Math.max(maxDegree, row.reduce((sum, val) => sum + val, 0));\n  }\n\n  const P = math.identity(adjacencyMatrix.length);  // Start with identity matrix\n\n  for (let i = 0; i < adjacencyMatrix.length; i++) {\n    for (let j = 0; j < adjacencyMatrix[i].length; j++) {\n      if (i !== j && adjacencyMatrix[i][j] === 1) {\n        P.subset(math.index(i, j), 1 / maxDegree);\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  return P;\n}\n\nlet agentOpinions = [0.2, 0.8, 0.5, 0.6]; // Initial opinions (e.g., on writing style 0-1 scale)\nconst P = getMaxDegreeWeights(adjacencyMatrix);\n\n\nfunction updateOpinions(newObservations) {  // newObservations: Array of new agent inputs\n  let combinedInput = math.add(agentOpinions, newObservations); // z(t) in the paper\n  agentOpinions = math.multiply(P, combinedInput); \n}\n\n\n// Example Usage: Agents provide feedback after LLM suggestion.\nconst llmSuggestionStyleScore = 0.9;\nconst agentFeedback = [0.1, 0.2, -0.1, 0]; // Positive or negative adjustments based on feedback\n\nupdateOpinions(agentFeedback);\nconsole.log(agentOpinions); // Updated agent opinions after consensus\n\n```\n\n\n**3. Integrating with LLMs:**\n\nUse a JavaScript LLM library (e.g., `langchain.js`) to generate text. The consensus reached using the optimized `P` matrix can inform prompts, parameters, or post-processing steps.\n\n```javascript\n// ... inside an async function\n\n//Simplified langchain example:\nconst { LLMChain, PromptTemplate } = require(\"langchain\");\nconst { OpenAI } = require(\"langchain/llms/openai\");\n\nconst llm = new OpenAI({ temperature: agentOpinions.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0) / agentOpinions.length }); // Temperature influenced by consensus on style\n\nconst promptTemplate = new PromptTemplate({\n template: \"Write a paragraph about {topic} in a {style} tone.\",\n inputVariables: [\"topic\", \"style\"],\n});\n\nconst chain = new LLMChain({ llm, promptTemplate });\nconst response = await chain.call({ topic: \"space exploration\", style:  \"formal\" /* Get style from agentOpinions */});\n\n// ... further processing of the LLM output\n```\n\n**Key improvements over basic averaging:**\n\n* **Faster convergence:** Optimized weights can help agents agree on parameters for LLM prompting more quickly, leading to a more responsive application.\n* **Robustness to outliers:**  In scenarios where one agent might have very different preferences, the optimized `P` matrix (especially using FMMC/FDLA later on) can reduce the impact of extreme opinions and ensure a more stable consensus.\n* **Adaptability to network structure:** By accounting for the relationship between agents, the system can function effectively even with complex communication patterns.\n\n\n\nThis example demonstrates how the research can be applied. Future directions would involve integrating the full FMMC/FDLA calculations for more complex scenarios, exploring different network structures, and evaluating the impact of optimized consensus on LLM output quality.  The core idea is to move beyond simple averaging and leverage the network structure for more efficient multi-agent coordination in web applications.",
  "pseudocode": "The paper doesn't contain explicit pseudocode blocks. However, several mathematical formulations describe algorithms central to the research.  Here's a JavaScript representation and explanation of those algorithms:\n\n**1. Coop-UCB2 Arm Selection (Equation 1):**\n\n```javascript\nfunction calculateQ(s, n, t, sigma_a, gamma, eta, M) {\n  // s: Estimated total reward for the arm by the agent\n  // n: Number of times the arm was selected by the agent\n  // t: Current timestep\n  // sigma_a, gamma, eta: Algorithm parameters (see paper)\n  // M: Number of agents\n\n  const f = t > 1 ? Math.log(t - 1) : 0; // Avoid log(0)\n  const G = 1 - (eta * eta) / 16;\n  const explorationTerm = Math.sqrt((2* sigma_a * sigma_a * Math.log(gamma * Math.pow(t -1, M))) / (n+f));\n  return (s / (n+f)) + explorationTerm;\n\n\n}\n\nfunction selectArm(Qs) {\n  // Qs: An array of Q values for each arm\n\n  let bestArm = 0;\n  let maxQ = -Infinity;\n\n  for (let i = 0; i < Qs.length; i++) {\n    if (Qs[i] > maxQ) {\n      maxQ = Qs[i];\n      bestArm = i;\n    }\n  }\n  return bestArm;\n}\n\n\n// Example Usage (for agent k and arm i):\nlet s_ki = 10; \nlet n_ki = 5;\nlet t = 100;\nlet sigma_a = 1;\nlet gamma = 1.2;\nlet eta = 0.1;\nlet M = 3;\n\nlet Q_ki = calculateQ(s_ki, n_ki, t, sigma_a, gamma, eta, M);\n\n\nlet Qs = [ /* Q values for all arms */]; // Example: [0.5, 0.8, 0.2]\nlet chosenArm = selectArm(Qs);\n\nconsole.log(\"Chosen arm:\", chosenArm);\n\n```\n\n* **Purpose:** This code implements the core of the Coop-UCB2 algorithm. It calculates the estimated value (`Q`) of each arm for an agent, considering both the current reward estimate and an exploration term. The `selectArm` function then chooses the arm with the highest `Q` value.\n\n**2. Consensus Update (Equations 2 & 3):**\n\n```javascript\nfunction updateEstimates(P, n_previous, s_previous, rewards, selections) {\n  // P: Transition matrix\n  // n_previous: Previous number of selections for each arm (array of vectors)\n  // s_previous: Previous total reward for each arm (array of vectors)\n  // rewards: Rewards received in the current timestep for each arm (array of vectors)\n  // selections: Number of times each arm selected for each agent.\n\n\n  const n_current = [];\n  const s_current = [];\n\n\n  for (let i = 0; i < n_previous.length; i++) { // Iterate over arms\n     // Elementwise matrix multiplication is not directly supported in JS standard lib so you may need to use external library or define it yourself for simplicity here we just present it as matrix multiplication\n    n_current[i] = matrixMultiply(P, matrixAdd(n_previous[i], selections[i]));\n    s_current[i] = matrixMultiply(P, matrixAdd(s_previous[i], rewards[i]));\n  }\n  return [n_current, s_current];\n}\n\n\n// Example usage: you should define your own `matrixMultiply` and `matrixAdd` functions\n// These helper matrix operations may be provided with JavaScript linear algebra libraries\nlet P = [ /* Transition matrix values */ ];\nlet n_previous = [ /* previous n values */ ];\nlet s_previous = [ /* previous s values */ ];\nlet rewards = [ /* current rewards */ ];\nlet selections = [/*number of selection for each arm*/];\n\nlet [n_current, s_current] = updateEstimates(P, n_previous, s_previous, rewards, selections);\n\nconsole.log(\"Updated n:\", n_current);\nconsole.log(\"Updated s:\", s_current);\n```\n\n* **Purpose:** This function updates the agents' estimates of the number of selections (`n`) and total reward (`s`) for each arm based on the rewards received in the current timestep and information shared through the network (represented by the transition matrix `P`). `matrixMultiply` and `matrixAdd` are assumed helper functions for matrix operations.\n\n**3. Transition Matrix Calculation (Equation 4):**  The code for this is embedded in the answer about FMMC and FDLA optimization below.\n\n**4. Fastest Mixing Markov Chain (FMMC) and Fastest Distributed Linear Averaging (FDLA):**  These are convex optimization problems best solved using specialized libraries or solvers,  rather than implementing the solver algorithms directly in JavaScript. However,  here's how you might set up the problem in JavaScript to be used with a solver:\n\n```javascript\n// Assuming you have a library that can handle SDP problems (e.g., cvxpy in Python)\n// and functions for matrix operations (e.g., numericjs)\n\n\n\nfunction calculateP_FMMC(adjacencyMatrix, M) {\n\n\n    //  Call your SDP Solver here. The exact syntax will depend on your chosen library.\n    //  Pass the objective function and constraints defined in Equation 7 in the paper.\n\n\n}\n\n\nfunction calculateP_FDLA(adjacencyMatrix, M) {\n\n    // Call your SDP Solver here. The exact syntax will depend on your chosen library.\n    // Pass the objective function and constraints defined in Equation 9 in the paper.\n\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n// Example usage (assuming a 3x3 adjacency matrix)\nconst adjacencyMatrix = [\n    [0, 1, 1],\n    [1, 0, 1],\n    [1, 1, 0],\n\n\n];\n\nconst M = adjacencyMatrix.length;\n\nconst P_FMMC = calculateP_FMMC(adjacencyMatrix, M);\nconst P_FDLA = calculateP_FDLA(adjacencyMatrix, M);\n\n\nconsole.log(\"P_FMMC:\", P_FMMC);\nconsole.log(\"P_FDLA:\", P_FDLA);\n\n```\n\n* **Purpose:** These functions would use a suitable solver library to calculate the optimal transition matrix `P` using either the FMMC or FDLA method.  The provided code is a conceptual outline; the actual implementation using an SDP solver requires specific library functions and formatting.\n\n\n\nThese JavaScript snippets, combined with an appropriate SDP solver and matrix math library, provide a practical starting point for JavaScript developers exploring the MAMAB algorithms described in the paper.  Remember to install the necessary libraries.  This response provides the algorithm translations and core framework; further development would be required to create a full, working application.",
