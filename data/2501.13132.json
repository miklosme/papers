  "title": "A Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Framework for Multi-UAV Combat Using Leader-Follower Strategy",
  "abstract": "Multi-UAV air combat is a complex task involving multiple autonomous UAVs, an evolving field in both aerospace and artificial intelligence. This paper aims to enhance adversarial performance through collaborative strategies. Previous approaches predominantly discretize the action space into predefined actions, limiting UAV maneuverability and complex strategy implementation. Others simplify the problem to 1v1 combat, neglecting the cooperative dynamics among multiple UAVs. To address the high-dimensional challenges inherent in six-degree-of-freedom space and improve cooperation, we propose a hierarchical framework utilizing the Leader-Follower Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (LFMAPPO) strategy. Specifically, the framework is structured into three levels. The top level conducts a macro-level assessment of the environment and guides execution policy. The middle level determines the angle of the desired action. The bottom level generates precise action commands for the high-dimensional action space. Moreover, we optimize the state-value functions by assigning distinct roles with the leader-follower strategy to train the top-level policy, followers estimate the leader's utility, promoting effective cooperation among agents. Additionally, the incorporation of a target selector, aligned with the UAVs' posture, assesses the threat level of targets. Finally, simulation experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.",
  "summary": "This paper proposes a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for coordinating multiple UAVs in air combat using a leader-follower strategy.  The framework allows UAVs to learn complex collaborative maneuvers, outperforming traditional methods that treat multi-UAV combat as multiple independent 1v1 engagements.  A key improvement is a modified critic within the multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm, allowing followers to prioritize the leader's actions for better coordination.  This approach is relevant to LLM-based multi-agent systems as it demonstrates a method for improving agent collaboration and decision-making within a hierarchical structure, potentially applicable to complex, multi-agent scenarios beyond air combat. The target selector further refines agent focus and action selection in complex environments, relevant to prioritizing interactions within multi-agent LLM systems.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework with a leader-follower strategy for coordinating multiple UAVs in air combat.  While the context is military, the core concepts are highly relevant to JavaScript developers building LLM-based multi-agent applications for the web. Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights:\n\n**1. Hierarchical Action Planning:**\n\n* **Concept:** The paper's three-tiered hierarchy (macro-strategy, action angles, action commands) can be applied to complex web interactions.  Instead of directly issuing LLM prompts, create a hierarchy.\n* **Example:** Imagine a multi-agent collaborative writing tool.\n    * **Macro-level (Policy Selector):**  Determine the overall writing goal (e.g., \"write a blog post about AI\").  This could be a user selection or an LLM decision.\n    * **Middle-level (Sub-policies):** Choose writing strategies based on the goal (e.g., \"research,\" \"outline,\" \"draft,\" \"edit\"). These can be implemented as separate LLM agents or prompts with defined roles.\n    * **Low-level (Action Commands):**  Generate specific text based on the chosen strategy.  LLMs execute these commands, generating paragraphs, refining sentences, or suggesting improvements.\n* **JS Implementation:**  Langchain provides abstractions to implement this hierarchical approach.  You can also implement this logic using functions.\n\n**2. Leader-Follower Dynamics:**\n\n* **Concept:** Designate some LLMs as leaders, providing direction, and others as followers, refining and executing tasks. This is particularly beneficial for complex tasks like collaborative content creation, design, or problem-solving.\n* **Example:**  A multi-agent design tool could have a leader LLM proposing overall design layouts while follower LLMs specialize in refining individual elements (e.g., generating CSS, suggesting color palettes, creating image assets).\n* **JS Implementation:**  Create separate LLM instances (e.g., using Langchain), passing outputs from the leader to the followers.\n\n**3. Target Selection (Relevance Scoring):**\n\n* **Concept:** The paper emphasizes dynamically selecting targets based on threat level and posture.  In web development, this translates to prioritizing actions and requests within your multi-agent system.\n* **Example:**  In a customer service chatbot application, multiple agent LLMs might be available. A \"target selector\" function could analyze incoming customer requests, prioritizing them based on urgency, sentiment, or topic to route them to the most appropriate LLM agent.\n* **JS Implementation:** Develop a scoring function (e.g. Sentiment analysis using libraries like ml5.js, topic detection), to rank tasks/requests and dynamically allocate them to your LLMs.\n\n**4. Collaborative Training and State Sharing:**\n\n* **Concept:** Although not the primary focus of the paper, effective collaboration requires shared state and learning.  LLMs should be able to access and modify a shared state.\n* **Example:**  In a collaborative writing application, each LLM could access and modify a shared document or JSON representation. The leader could append new ideas; follower LLMs refine and elaborate based on this shared state.\n* **JS Implementation:** Use a shared database, in-memory store (e.g. Redis), or a shared JSON object accessible to all LLM agents.\n\n**5. Libraries and Frameworks:**\n\n* **Langchain:** Offers tools for chaining LLMs, managing prompts, and creating agent workflows.  It aligns well with the hierarchical concept from the paper.\n* **Hugging Face Transformers.js:**  Provides access to powerful LLMs in the browser, enabling client-side multi-agent systems.\n* **Web Workers:** Allow parallel execution of LLM agents in the background without blocking the UI.\n\n**Summary for JS Developers:**\n\nThis paper offers valuable insights for structuring and coordinating complex, multi-agent interactions within web applications.  The hierarchical approach, leader-follower dynamic, and dynamic task prioritization are directly applicable to various web development scenarios using LLMs, improving efficiency and fostering more intelligent and collaborative web experiences.  Experiment with these concepts using Langchain and client-side LLMs to create truly innovative applications.",
  "pseudocode": "No pseudocode block found. However, several mathematical formulas are present. They can be translated to Javascript as follows:\n\n**1. Discounted Cumulative Reward (Equation 1):**\n\n```javascript\nfunction calculateDiscountedReward(rewards, gamma) {\n  let discountedReward = 0;\n  let discountFactor = 1;\n  for (let i = 0; i < rewards.length; i++) {\n    discountedReward += rewards[i] * discountFactor;\n    discountFactor *= gamma;\n  }\n  return discountedReward;\n}\n\n\n// Example usage:\nconst rewards = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nconst gamma = 0.9;\nconst G = calculateDiscountedReward(rewards, gamma);\nconsole.log(\"Discounted Cumulative Reward:\", G); \n```\n\n* **Explanation:** This function calculates the discounted cumulative reward (G) given an array of rewards received at each time step and a discount factor (gamma).  It's crucial in reinforcement learning for evaluating the long-term value of actions.\n\n\n\n**2. Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) (Equation 2):**\n\n```javascript\nfunction calculateGAE(rewards, values, gamma, lambda) {\n  const advantages = [];\n  let advantage = 0;\n  for (let i = rewards.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n    const delta = rewards[i] + (i + 1 < rewards.length ? gamma * values[i + 1] : 0) - values[i];\n    advantage = delta + gamma * lambda * advantage;\n    advantages.unshift(advantage); // Add to the beginning\n  }\n  return advantages;\n}\n\n// Example Usage\nconst rewards = [1, 2, 0, 1];\nconst values = [2, 3, 1, 0];\nconst gamma = 0.9;\nconst lambda = 0.95;\n\nconst advantages = calculateGAE(rewards, values, gamma, lambda);\nconsole.log(\"Generalized Advantage Estimations:\", advantages);\n\n```\n\n* **Explanation:** This function calculates the GAE (A) which is a more stable and efficient way to estimate the advantage function in reinforcement learning, considering both immediate and future rewards.\n\n\n\n**3. Leader-Follower Value Function Update (Equation 3):**\n\n```javascript\nfunction updateValueFunctions(vf_current, vl_current, reward_f, reward_l, vf_next, vl_next, alpha, state_f, action_f, actions)\n{\n\n  const max_advantage = Math.max(...actions.map((a)=> a.advantage));\n\n  const vf_updated = (1-alpha) * vf_current + alpha * ( reward_f + gamma * max_advantage);\n\n  const vl_updated = (1-alpha) * vl_current + alpha * (reward_l + gamma* vl_next);\n\n  return {vf_updated, vl_updated}\n\n\n}\n\n// Example Usage:  (Illustrative, requires integrating into a larger RL framework)\nconst vf_current = 2;\nconst vl_current = 3;\nconst reward_f = 1;\nconst reward_l = 0.5;\nconst vf_next = 1;\nconst vl_next = 2;\nconst alpha = 0.1;\nconst state_f =  [/* state values*/];  // Replace with actual state representation\nconst action_f = [/* action values */]; // Replace with actual action representation\nconst actions = [{action: [/*...*/], advantage: 0.2}, {action: [/*...*/], advantage: 0.5}]; //Example\nconst gamma = 0.9;\n\nconst {vf_updated, vl_updated} = updateValueFunctions(vf_current, vl_current, reward_f, reward_l, vf_next, vl_next, alpha, state_f, action_f, actions)\n\n\nconsole.log(\"Updated Follower Value Function:\", vf_updated);\nconsole.log(\"Updated Leader Value Function:\", vl_updated);\n\n\n```\n\n* **Explanation:** This function updates the value functions for the follower and leader UAVs separately, incorporating the leader-follower relationship into the learning process.\n\n\n**4.  Posture Reward (Equation 7) & Distance Reward (Equation 8):**\n\n```javascript\nfunction calculatePostureReward(alpha, beta) {\n  const maxVal = Math.max(Math.atanh(1 - Math.max(alpha+beta, 1e-4)/ Math.PI)/ Math.PI, 0);\n  return minVal + 1/(25*(alpha + beta) + 2*Math.PI);\n}\n\nfunction calculateDistanceReward(distance, maxAttackRange)\n{\n\n  const x = distance / maxAttackRange;\n  const b1 = /* value */; // Requires tuning based on combat scenario\n  const b2 = /* value */;\n  const b3 = /* value */;\n  const b4 = /* value */;\n  const k1 = /* value */;\n  const k2 = /* value */;\n\n  if (x < 1)\n  {\n\n    return Math.exp(k1*x) + b1;\n  }\n\n  else if ( x>=1 && x < 2)\n  {\n\n    return Math.exp(k1 * x)/(x) + b2;\n  }\n\n  else{\n\n    return b3/(x) + b4\n\n  }\n\n\n\n}\n\n\n// Example Usage: (Illustrative values for alpha, beta, distance, maxAttackRange)\nconst alpha = 0.5; // Angle off\nconst beta = 0.3; // Target angle\nconst postureReward = calculatePostureReward(alpha, beta);\nconsole.log(\"Posture Reward:\", postureReward);\n\n\nconst distance = 2000; // Current distance to target\nconst maxAttackRange = 4000; // Maximum attack range\nconst distanceReward = calculateDistanceReward(distance, maxAttackRange);\nconsole.log(\"Distance Reward:\", distanceReward);\n\n```\n\n* **Explanation:** These functions calculate the reward components based on a UAV's posture (angles alpha and beta relative to target) and its distance to the target. These reward functions encourage desirable combat behaviors.\n\n\n\n**5. Target Score (Equation 9):**\n\n```javascript\nfunction calculateTargetScore(targetPosition, targetPosture, targetCapability, alpha, beta, gamma) {\n\n  return alpha * targetPosition + beta * targetPosture + gamma * targetCapability;\n}\n\n// Example usage: (Illustrative values for target attributes and weighting factors)\n\nconst targetPosition = 0.8; // E.g., proximity to critical areas (normalized)\nconst targetPosture = 0.6;  // E.g., vulnerability based on orientation (normalized)\nconst targetCapability = 0.9; //E.g., offensive/defensive capabilities (normalized)\nconst alpha = 0.5;\nconst beta = 0.3;\nconst gamma = 0.2;\n\n\nconst score = calculateTargetScore(targetPosition, targetPosture, targetCapability, alpha, beta, gamma);\nconsole.log(\"Target Score:\", score);\n\n```\n\n* **Explanation:** This function calculates a target's score based on factors like position, posture (vulnerability), and capability, weighted by factors (alpha, beta, gamma) representing mission priorities.\n\n\nThese JavaScript implementations provide a starting point for developers wanting to experiment with the multi-agent combat scenario described in the paper.  Remember that these are simplified snippets and will need to be integrated into a larger reinforcement learning framework, using libraries like TensorFlow.js or similar.  You'll also need to provide appropriate state representations, action spaces, and define the overall training loop.",
