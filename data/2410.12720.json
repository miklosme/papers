  "title": "HEnRY: A Multi-Agent System Framework for Multi-Domain Contexts",
  "abstract": "This project, named HEnRY, aims to introduce a Multi-Agent System (MAS) into Intesa Sanpaolo. The name HEnRY summarizes the project's core principles: the Hierarchical organization of agents in a layered structure for efficient resource management; Efficient optimization of resources and operations to enhance overall performance; Reactive ability of agents to quickly respond to environmental stimuli; and Yielding adaptability and flexibility of agents to handle unexpected situations. The discussion covers two distinct research paths: the first focuses on the system architecture, and the second on the collaboration between agents. This work is not limited to the specific structure of the Intesa Sanpaolo context; instead, it leverages existing research in MAS to introduce a new solution. Since Intesa Sanpaolo is organized according to a model that aligns with international corporate governance best practices, this approach could also be relevant to similar scenarios.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces HEnRY, a multi-agent system (MAS) framework designed for managing knowledge and tasks across multiple domains within a large organization. \n\nHere's how it's relevant to LLM-based multi-agent systems:\n\n* **LLM-powered agents:** HEnRY utilizes agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle domain-specific tasks and collaborate on complex problems.\n* **Domain-specific knowledge:** The system emphasizes segmenting knowledge into domains, allowing agents to specialize and utilize appropriate LLMs for their expertise.\n* **Hierarchical architecture:** Agents are organized hierarchically, with \"facilitator\" agents coordinating communication and tasks between domain-specific agents.\n* **Mediator agents:** For complex, cross-domain tasks, \"mediator\" agents orchestrate collaboration between different domain agents, ensuring efficient problem-solving.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents a fascinating, albeit early-stage, look at building a multi-agent system (MAS) for a complex organization. While it doesn't delve into JavaScript-specific implementations, we can extrapolate practical applications for JavaScript developers working on LLM-based multi-agent apps.\n\nHere's how a JavaScript developer could apply the paper's insights:\n\n**1. Agent Architecture with JavaScript and Node.js**\n\n* **Domain Agents:** You could build domain agents specializing in specific areas like natural language processing, data retrieval, or task execution. Each agent can leverage relevant JavaScript libraries:\n    * **NLP Agent:** Employ natural language processing libraries like `natural` or `compromise` to parse user requests and extract meaning.\n    * **Data Retrieval Agent:** Utilize libraries like `axios` to fetch data from APIs or databases based on user requests.\n    * **Task Execution Agent:** Use libraries specific to the task, such as calendar integration or email automation.\n* **Facilitator Agent:**  A Node.js service could act as the facilitator, receiving user requests, routing them to the appropriate domain agents, and consolidating responses. This facilitator could leverage a message broker like `Redis` or `RabbitMQ` for efficient communication.\n* **Digital Twin Agent:** This agent, potentially built with a framework like `Express.js`, could personalize user interactions. It would maintain user context, history, and preferences, enriching communication and understanding user needs.\n\n**2. Communication and Coordination**\n\n* **Message Queues:** Utilize message queues (`Redis`, `RabbitMQ`, etc.) to facilitate asynchronous communication between agents. This decoupled approach enhances scalability and fault tolerance.\n* **WebSockets:**  For real-time updates and collaborative scenarios, consider implementing WebSockets using libraries like `Socket.IO`. This enables direct, bi-directional communication between agents and potentially the user interface.\n\n**3.  Example Scenario: Building a Smart Assistant for Project Management**\n\nImagine building a smart assistant to help manage projects. You could have these domain agents:\n\n* **Task Management Agent:** Uses a library like `Asana` or `Trello`'s API to manage tasks, deadlines, and assignments.\n* **Communication Agent:**  Integrates with Slack or Microsoft Teams using their respective APIs to send notifications and facilitate team discussions.\n* **Resource Allocation Agent:** Connects to a resource management system to track resource availability and assign tasks accordingly.\n\nThe facilitator would orchestrate these agents to provide a seamless experience:\n\n1. A user requests a new project timeline through the Digital Twin's web interface (built with React, Vue, or similar).\n2. The Digital Twin sends the request to the facilitator via a message queue.\n3. The facilitator breaks down the request and dispatches tasks:\n    * Task Management Agent creates project tasks and subtasks.\n    * Communication Agent notifies the team about the new project and deadlines.\n    * Resource Allocation Agent assigns team members based on availability.\n4. Agents update their respective systems and report back to the facilitator.\n5. The facilitator consolidates the information and notifies the Digital Twin, which updates the user.\n\n**Key Takeaways for JavaScript Developers**\n\n* **Modularity and Reusability:**  Break down complex problems into smaller, specialized agents for better maintainability and scalability.\n* **Asynchronous Communication:** Embrace asynchronous paradigms like message queues to enhance system resilience and responsiveness.\n* **Leverage the JavaScript Ecosystem:** Utilize the vast array of JavaScript libraries and frameworks to build powerful and efficient multi-agent systems tailored to web development needs.\n\nThis paper provides a high-level blueprint. JavaScript developers, with their knowledge of web technologies and frameworks, are well-positioned to translate these concepts into practical, LLM-powered multi-agent applications that revolutionize how we interact with the web.",
