  "title": "SOCRATIC: Enhancing Human Teamwork via AI-enabled Coaching",
  "abstract": "Coaches are vital for effective collaboration, but cost and resource constraints often limit their availability during real-world tasks. This limitation poses serious challenges in life-critical domains that rely on effective teamwork, such as healthcare and disaster response. To address this gap, we propose and realize an innovative application of AI: task-time team coaching. Specifically, we introduce SOCRATIC, a novel AI system that complements human coaches by providing real-time guidance during task execution. SOCRATIC monitors team behavior, detects misalignments in team members' shared understanding, and delivers automated interventions to improve team performance. We validated SOCRATIC through two human subject experiments involving dyadic collaboration. The results demonstrate that the system significantly enhances team performance with minimal interventions. Participants also perceived SOCRATIC as helpful and trustworthy, supporting its potential for adoption. Our findings also suggest promising directions both for AI research and its practical applications to enhance human teamwork.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces SOCRATIC, an AI system designed to enhance human teamwork in real-time, particularly for complex, time-sensitive tasks like disaster response or surgery.  SOCRATIC acts as a virtual coach, monitoring team actions, inferring team members' intentions, and offering targeted suggestions when it detects potential misalignments that could lead to suboptimal performance.\n\nKey points for LLM-based multi-agent systems:\n\n* **Intent inference:** SOCRATIC uses a Bayesian approach and leverages multi-agent imitation learning (specifically BTIL) trained on human demonstrations to model team behavior and infer the likely intentions of each team member, even with partial information. This is relevant to building LLMs that can understand and predict the goals and actions of multiple agents in a collaborative setting.\n* **Intervention generation:** The system uses a cost-benefit analysis based on the inferred intents to decide when and how to intervene, aiming to provide helpful guidance without disrupting the team's workflow. This is analogous to prompting strategies in LLMs, where the system needs to decide when to provide feedback or suggestions.\n* **Human-AI collaboration:** SOCRATIC is designed to work *with* human teams, not replace them. It focuses on improving coordination and communication among human members by providing real-time support and feedback.  This aligns with the growing focus on building LLMs that can collaborate effectively with humans in various tasks.\n* **Task-time coaching:** The focus is on delivering real-time, in-the-moment feedback during task execution, as opposed to post-hoc analysis.  This is relevant to building interactive LLM applications where the system needs to provide dynamic and context-aware responses.\n* **User interface:** SOCRATIC uses a user-friendly interface to deliver its interventions to the human team.  This highlights the importance of designing intuitive interfaces for LLM-based systems to facilitate seamless human-AI interaction.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents Socratic, an AI coach that enhances teamwork in multi-agent systems, particularly relevant for LLM-based agents in web applications.  Here are practical examples for JavaScript developers:\n\n**1. Building a Collaborative Writing Tool:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine building a collaborative writing tool where multiple LLM-based agents assist users with writing different sections of a document (e.g., introduction, literature review, methodology).\n* **Applying Socratic:** Use a JavaScript framework like React or Vue.js to build the frontend. Implement a central \"coach\" agent (using a library like LangChain or LlamaIndex) that monitors the output of each LLM \"writer\" agent.  The coach can analyze the text for consistency in style, terminology, and argument flow. If inconsistencies or potential misalignments are detected (e.g., conflicting statements across sections), the coach agent, via the JavaScript frontend, can provide feedback to the writer agents (e.g., suggesting changes in phrasing or providing relevant context from other sections).  This feedback loop mimics Socratic's intervention mechanism.\n\n**2. Developing a Multi-Agent Customer Support Chatbot:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  Multiple specialized LLM agents handle different aspects of customer support (e.g., order status, technical issues, billing).\n* **Applying Socratic:** Implement each agent using a JavaScript chatbot framework (e.g., Botpress, Rasa).  A coach agent, also implemented as a chatbot but with broader knowledge, monitors the ongoing conversations.  If a customer's issue spans multiple domains, the coach can detect this and facilitate hand-off between agents or provide summarizing information to ensure a seamless experience.  This avoids frustrating back-and-forth between specialized agents.\n\n**3. Creating a Multi-Agent Game:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  Players interact with several LLM-based characters in a web-based game.\n* **Applying Socratic:** Use a JavaScript game engine like Phaser or PixiJS. Each character is an LLM-based agent. A coach agent monitors the game state and player actions. If a player is struggling or the characters' actions are not aligned with the overall narrative, the coach can subtly intervene, providing hints to the player or adjusting the characters' behavior to ensure a more engaging experience.\n\n**4. Building a Collaborative Design Platform:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Multiple users and LLM agents work together on a design project (e.g., website design, graphic design).\n* **Applying Socratic:**  A central coach agent, built using LangChain or similar libraries, tracks each agent's contributions (user actions and LLM-generated design elements).  If a misalignment occurs (e.g., conflicting design choices), the coach can flag the issue and suggest a course correction.  The frontend would be built with React, Vue.js, or similar and display the design and coach feedback.\n\n\n**Key JavaScript Technologies and Concepts:**\n\n* **LLM Libraries:** LangChain and LlamaIndex for building and managing the coach and writer agents.\n* **Frontend Frameworks:** React, Vue.js, or Angular for building interactive user interfaces and feedback displays.\n* **Chatbot Frameworks:**  Botpress or Rasa for implementing conversational agents.\n* **Game Engines:** Phaser or PixiJS for game development.\n* **WebSockets:** For real-time communication between agents and the coach.\n* **Asynchronous JavaScript:**  Crucial for handling multiple agents concurrently and processing LLM responses.\n\n**Focusing on Intent:**\n\nSocratic emphasizes the importance of recognizing intent.  In JavaScript development, this translates to incorporating structured data formats (e.g., JSON-LD) to represent the intent of different actions or outputs.  This allows the coach agent to analyze the \"meaning\" behind the agents' actions rather than just their surface-level outputs.  You can also adapt prompt engineering techniques to focus on eliciting specific intents from your LLMs, assisting the \"coach\" with its analysis.\n\n\nBy implementing these practical examples, JavaScript developers can leverage the insights from the Socratic paper to build more robust and effective LLM-based multi-agent systems for the web, enhancing user experience and tackling complex collaborative tasks.  These scenarios also offer fertile ground for further research into the intersection of multi-agent systems and human-computer interaction.",
