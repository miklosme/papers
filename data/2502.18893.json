  "title": "Distributed Online Task Assignment via Inexact ADMM for unplanned online tasks and its Applications to Security",
  "abstract": "Abstract-In multi-robot system (MRS) applications, efficient task assignment is essential not only for coordinating agents and ensuring mission success but also for maintaining overall system security. In this work, we first propose an optimization-based distributed task assignment algorithm that dynamically assigns mandatory security-critical tasks and optional tasks among teams. Leveraging an inexact Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)-based approach, we decompose the task assignment problem into separable and non-separable subproblems. The non-separable subproblems are transformed into an inexact ADMM update by projected gradient descent, which can be performed through several communication steps within the team. In the second part of this paper, we formulate a comprehensive framework that enables MRS under plan-deviation attacks to handle online tasks without compromising security. The process begins with a security analysis that determines whether an online task can be executed securely by a robot and, if so, the required time and location for the robot to rejoin the team. Next, the proposed task assignment algorithm is used to allocate security-related tasks and verified online tasks. Finally, task fulfillment is managed using a Control Lyapunov Function (CLF)-based controller, while security enforcement is ensured through a Control Barrier Function (CBF)-based security filter. Through simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed framework allows MRS to effectively respond to unplanned online tasks while maintaining security guarantees.",
  "summary": "This paper proposes a distributed algorithm for assigning tasks to multiple robots, prioritizing critical security tasks while allowing for flexible responses to unplanned tasks.  It leverages inexact ADMM to decompose the problem, enabling distributed computation among robots with local communication.  A key application is explored: co-observation-secured map exploration, where robots monitor each other to detect malicious deviations.  This integrates with the task assignment to ensure security is maintained even when responding to unplanned tasks.  This approach could be relevant to LLM-based multi-agent systems where agents need to coordinate complex tasks while maintaining security and responding to unforeseen events in a distributed manner.  The focus on decentralized computation and robust task prioritization aligns with the challenges of building distributed and reliable multi-agent applications.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents a distributed task assignment algorithm applicable to LLM-based multi-agent systems in web development. Here are practical examples illustrating how JavaScript developers can leverage these insights:\n\n**1. Collaborative Content Creation:**\n\nImagine a web application for collaborative story writing, using multiple LLMs as agents.  Each LLM agent has a specialized role (e.g., plot development, character dialogue, descriptive writing).  The distributed task assignment algorithm can dynamically allocate writing tasks to different LLMs based on their strengths and current story context.\n\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** A Node.js backend can manage the agents, using a library like `socket.io` for real-time communication.  Each agent could be a separate process running an LLM interface library. The frontend (React, Vue, or Angular) would display the evolving story and allow user interaction to trigger new tasks. The task assignment algorithm would be implemented in the backend, prioritizing tasks based on user input and story coherence.\n\n\n**2. Multi-Agent Customer Support Chatbot:**\n\nInstead of a single chatbot, a team of specialized LLM agents could handle different aspects of customer queries (e.g., order status, technical support, billing inquiries). The distributed task assignment algorithm can route incoming queries to the most suitable agent based on keywords, query context, and agent availability.\n\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** Similar to the collaborative writing scenario, a Node.js backend with `socket.io` could manage the agents.  Integrate with a chat platform API (e.g., Twilio, Sendbird) to handle the user interface.  The task assignment algorithm, running in the backend, would analyze incoming messages and dynamically assign them to appropriate agents, improving response time and accuracy.\n\n\n**3. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) Management:**\n\nLLM agents could automate tasks within a DAO, such as proposal evaluation, voting coordination, and treasury management.  The distributed task assignment algorithm can delegate tasks to agents based on their expertise and the DAO's current needs, promoting efficiency and decentralization.\n\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** Use a web3 library like `ethers.js` or `web3.js` to interact with the DAO's smart contracts.  A Node.js backend could manage the LLM agents, assigning them tasks based on events emitted by the smart contracts. The algorithm would ensure distributed task handling and fault tolerance within the DAO.\n\n\n\n**Key JavaScript Considerations:**\n\n* **Communication:** Real-time communication between agents is crucial. Libraries like `socket.io` or message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) are suitable.\n\n* **Agent Management:** Implement a system to manage the lifecycle and state of each agent.\n\n* **LLM Interfacing:** Libraries like `langchain.js` facilitate interaction with LLMs from JavaScript.\n\n* **Security:** Address potential security vulnerabilities by validating agent inputs and outputs, using techniques suggested in the paper like \"co-observation\" (cross-checking agent responses) where applicable.\n\n\n**Bridging the Gap between Research and Practice:**\n\nThe paper's theoretical concepts translate to practical web development scenarios by:\n\n* **Prioritization:** The algorithm prioritizes tasks, allowing developers to ensure critical functionalities are always handled.\n* **Scalability:** The distributed nature of the algorithm allows for handling increasing numbers of agents and tasks as the application grows.\n* **Robustness:** By avoiding a single point of failure, the system becomes more robust and resilient to individual agent errors.\n\nBy implementing these concepts in JavaScript and utilizing relevant web technologies, developers can explore the potential of multi-agent LLM-based systems to create more interactive, intelligent, and robust web applications.",

This lookup table is crucial for enabling robots to deviate from the planned trajectory to handle online tasks while maintaining security guarantees (i.e., not entering forbidden regions).\n\nThe algorithm iterates through the planned trajectory waypoints.  For each waypoint `q1`, it determines the farthest future waypoint `q2` such that the reachability ellipsoid between `q1` and `q2` does *not* intersect any forbidden regions. The index of this farthest safe waypoint `q2` (or the corresponding time) is stored as the \"latest secure regroup time\" for `q1` in the lookup table.  This means that if a robot deviates at `q1`, it can safely rejoin the team at or before the time associated with `q2` without compromising security.  The `isSecure` helper function determines if the reachability ellipsoid between two waypoints intersects any forbidden regions.\n\nThis pre-computation is important for efficient online decision-making, as it avoids the need for computationally intensive reachability analysis during the mission.  When an online task appears, the robot can quickly consult the lookup table to determine if it can be handled safely.  This contributes to real-time responsiveness to online tasks within the co-observation-secured multi-robot system.",
