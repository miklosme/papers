  "title": "Online Fair Division: Towards Ex-Post Constant MMS Guarantees",
  "abstract": "Abstract\n\nWe investigate the problem of fairly allocating m indivisible items among n sequentially arriving agents with additive valuations, under the sought-after fairness notion of maximin share (MMS). We first observe a strong impossibility: without appropriate knowledge about the valuation functions of the incoming agents, no online algorithm can ensure any non-trivial MMS approximation, even when there are only two agents. Motivated by this impossibility, we introduce ONLINEKTYPEFD (online k-type fair division), a model that balances theoretical tractability with real-world applicability. In this model, each arriving agent belongs to one of k types, with all agents of a given type sharing the same known valuation function. We do not constrain k to be a constant. Upon arrival, an agent reveals her type, receives an irrevocable allocation, and departs. We study the ex-post MMS guarantees of online algorithms under two arrival models:\n\n•\tAdversarial arrivals: In this model, an adversary determines the type of each arriving agent. We design a -MMS competitive algorithm and complement it with a lower bound, ruling out any Ω()-MMS-competitive algorithm, even for binary valuations.\n•\tStochastic arrivals: In this model, the type of each arriving agent is independently drawn from an underlying, possibly unknown distribution. Unlike the adversarial setting where the dependence on k is unavoidable, we surprisingly show that in the stochastic setting, an asymptotic, arbitrarily close-to-½-MMS competitive guarantee is achievable under mild distributional assumptions.\n\nOur results extend naturally to a learning-augmented framework; when given access to predictions about valuation functions, we show that the competitive ratios of our algorithms degrade gracefully with multiplicative prediction errors. The main technical challenge is guaranteeing ex-post fairness, i.e., ensuring that every arriving agent gets a bundle of sufficient value. For this, we design novel approaches built on ideas of maintaining tentative overlapping allocations and multi-phase bag-filling, combined with procedures to carefully handle high-valued items, all of which may be of independent interest.",
  "summary": "This paper tackles the challenge of fairly dividing indivisible items among agents arriving online.  Since achieving perfect fairness (Maximin Share or MMS) is impossible in this setting, the authors introduce ONLINEKTYPEFD, where agents belong to one of *k* known types with predefined valuations. They design algorithms for both adversarial and stochastic agent arrivals.  Under stochastic arrivals with known probability distribution, they achieve a near-optimal MMS guarantee.  Even with unknown distributions, they provide a learning-augmented approach.\n\n\nFor LLM-based multi-agent systems, this research is relevant because it provides a framework for thinking about type-based agent interactions with shared resources. The algorithms, while not directly applicable to LLMs, offer insights into resource allocation in dynamic, online environments. The concept of types could be analogous to pre-trained LLM models or specific prompts/roles, and the valuation functions could represent the utility of different data or computational resources to those LLMs. The learning-augmented approach is particularly intriguing, as it suggests a path towards adapting resource allocation strategies as the system learns more about agent behavior.",
  "takeaways": "This paper's insights on online fair division with agent arrivals are highly relevant to JavaScript developers building LLM-based multi-agent web applications. Here are some practical examples, focusing on leveraging the \"k-type\" model and the stochastic arrival model:\n\n**1. Dynamic Content Recommendation:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine an e-commerce site with multiple LLM agents recommending products. Each agent has a \"personality\" (type) reflected in its recommendation strategy (e.g., \"budget-conscious,\" \"trend-focused,\" \"luxury-oriented\").  Users arrive stochastically, and their preferences might align with different agent types.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * **Agent Types:** Define agent types using distinct prompts or fine-tuned LLM models. Each type could use a specific knowledge base or focus on different product attributes.\n    * **Allocation Algorithm:** Implement a JavaScript version of Algorithm 3 (stochastic arrival, known distribution) or Algorithm 7 (unknown distribution) to choose which agent's recommendations to display to each user. Track user engagement (clicks, purchases) to estimate the distribution of user preferences over agent types.\n    * **Frontend Framework:** Use a framework like React or Vue.js to dynamically render recommendations based on the chosen agent.  Store agent types and allocation logic in a centralized state management library like Redux or Vuex.\n\n**2. Collaborative Writing or Code Generation:**\n\n* **Scenario:** A multi-agent system where LLMs assist users with writing or coding. Each agent specializes in a particular style or domain (e.g., \"technical documentation,\" \"creative writing,\" \"JavaScript,\" \"Python\"). Users arrive with different tasks, needing different agent expertise.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * **Agent Specialization:** Use different prompts, fine-tuning, or even different LLM providers to create specialized agents.\n    * **Task Allocation:** Implement a JavaScript-based allocation algorithm (Algorithm 3 or 7) based on the incoming task descriptions (e.g., keywords, language).\n    * **Collaboration Framework:** Integrate the agents within a collaborative editor (e.g., ProseMirror, CodeMirror) using JavaScript. The allocation algorithm dynamically assigns sections or code blocks to the most appropriate agent.\n\n**3. Personalized Chatbot Interactions:**\n\n* **Scenario:** A customer support system using multiple LLM-powered chatbots. Each agent is trained on a specific product line or has a different communication style (e.g., \"formal,\" \"informal,\" \"technical\"). Users arrive with diverse questions, requiring different agent expertise.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * **Chatbot Personalities:** Train different LLM-based chatbots using distinct datasets or prompts.\n    * **Routing Algorithm:** Implement a JavaScript routing algorithm (Algorithm 3 or 7) based on user input (e.g., product name, keywords).\n    * **Chat Framework:** Integrate the chatbots within a web-based chat interface using a library like Chat.js or a framework like React.  The routing algorithm dynamically assigns the incoming chat to the appropriate agent.\n\n**4. Multi-Agent Game Development:**\n\n* **Scenario:** A browser-based game with multiple LLM-controlled non-player characters (NPCs).  Each NPC has a distinct role or behavior (type), e.g., \"trader,\" \"warrior,\" \"explorer.\" Players interact with NPCs stochastically.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * **NPC Behaviors:** Implement different NPC types using separate LLM agents, each with its own goals and strategies.\n    * **Interaction Management:** Use a JavaScript implementation of Algorithm 3 or 7 to manage interactions between players and NPCs, assigning interactions to the most relevant NPC type based on player actions or context.\n    * **Game Engine/Framework:** Integrate the agents within a JavaScript game engine like Phaser or Babylon.js.\n\n**Key Considerations for JavaScript Developers:**\n\n* **MMS Computation:** The paper assumes access to MMS values. While exact computation is complex, approximate methods or heuristics are likely sufficient for practical web applications.\n* **Learning-Augmented Framework:** Embrace the learning aspect. Continuously monitor user feedback and update the distribution of user preferences over agent types to improve allocation decisions over time.\n* **Scalability:** If the number of agent types or users is very large, optimize the JavaScript implementation of the allocation algorithms for performance. Consider using Web Workers for computationally intensive tasks.\n\n\nBy applying the k-type model and the allocation algorithms presented in the paper, JavaScript developers can build more intelligent and responsive multi-agent web applications that fairly distribute resources and provide personalized experiences to users arriving online.  Remember to leverage the learning capabilities of LLMs to continuously refine the system's understanding of user preferences and optimize the fairness of resource allocation.",

The goal is to allocate indivisible items to sequentially arriving agents such that each agent receives a bundle of items worth at least a fraction (1/k in this case) of their Maximin Share (MMS).\n* **Key Concepts:**\n    * **Tentative Allocations (G):**  The algorithm maintains a set of tentative bundles `G[i]` for each agent type `i`.  These bundles are valued at least 1/k by the corresponding type.\n    * **Saturated Types:** A type is considered saturated if it has enough tentative bundles to satisfy all potential remaining agents of that type.\n    * **Bag-Filling:**  If no tentative bundle is available for an arriving agent, a new bundle is created by iteratively adding items until at least one unsaturated type values it at 1/k or higher. If the current agent values the filled bag sufficiently, it's allocated. Otherwise, the bag becomes a tentative allocation for the unsaturated types who value it sufficiently.\n\n\n**Algorithm 2 Explanation:**\n\n* **Purpose:** This preprocessing function is a helper function used by Algorithm 1. It creates initial tentative allocations by identifying high-valued items (valued at least 1/k) for each type and adding them as singleton bundles to the tentative allocation set `G`.\n* **Relationship to Algorithm 1:** By pre-allocating highly valued items, Algorithm 2 helps in ensuring that these items are not wasted by allocating to lower valued types initially, thereby increasing the chances of satisfying MMS guarantees later in the main allocation process.\n\n**Other Algorithms (3, 4, 5, 6, and 7) and Remaining JavaScript Code:**\n\nThe user's request was to provide JavaScript for the pseudocode blocks. Algorithm 1 and 2 are the only ones presented in pseudocode format in the provided research paper excerpt. Algorithms 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are discussed conceptually but not given in explicit pseudocode form. Implementing these would require a deeper dive into the paper's details and potentially designing the corresponding logic in JavaScript from the descriptions.  The provided JavaScript includes placeholder functions (`getAgentType` and `allocateToAgent`) to simulate agent arrivals and allocations. These need to be replaced with appropriate implementations depending on the experimental setup.",
