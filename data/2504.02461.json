  "title": "Am I Being Treated Fairly? A Conceptual Framework for Individuals to Ascertain Fairness",
  "abstract": "Current fairness metrics and mitigation techniques provide tools for practitioners to assess how non-discriminatory Automatic Decision Making (ADM) systems are. What if I, as an individual facing a decision taken by an ADM system, would like to know: Am I being treated fairly?. We explore how to create the affordance for users to be able to ask this question of ADM. In this paper, we argue for the reification of fairness not only as a property of ADM, but also as an epistemic right of an individual to acquire information about the decisions that affect them and use that information to contest and seek effective redress against those decisions, in case they are proven to be discriminatory. We examine key concepts from existing research not only in algorithmic fairness but also in explainable artificial intelligence, accountability, and contestability. Integrating notions from these domains, we propose a conceptual framework to ascertain fairness by combining different tools that empower the end-users of ADM systems. Our framework shifts the focus from technical solutions aimed at practitioners to mechanisms that enable individuals to understand, challenge, and verify the fairness of decisions, and also serves as a blueprint for organizations and policymakers, bridging the gap between technical requirements and practical, user-centered accountability.",
  "summary": "This paper proposes a framework called \"ascertainable fairness\" to help users understand and challenge decisions made by AI systems (specifically Algorithmic Decision-Making or ADM).  It aims to give individuals more power in situations where AI impacts their lives, moving beyond technical fairness metrics to a more user-centric approach.\n\nKey points for LLM-based multi-agent systems:\n\n* **Explainability and Contestability:** The framework emphasizes the need for clear explanations of AI decisions and mechanisms for users to challenge those decisions (contestation).  This directly relates to designing LLMs that can explain their reasoning and engage in dialogue to justify their actions.  Multi-agent contestation dialogues could involve negotiation and argumentation between user agents and system agents.\n* **Fairness of Recourse:**  The framework considers the fairness of the steps a user must take to change an AI's decision.  This is relevant to LLM agents that provide recommendations or suggest actions. The \"recourse\" offered by these agents should be fair and unbiased.\n* **Auditing:**  The framework includes mechanisms for external audits of AI systems, which can ensure accountability and transparency.  This relates to developing methods for auditing the behavior of LLM agents, including their internal decision-making processes and their interactions with other agents.\n* **User-Centric Fairness:**  The framework emphasizes the importance of individual perceptions of fairness, recognizing that users may have different values and priorities than the developers of AI systems. This highlights the need for LLM agents to be adaptable and personalize their interactions to align with individual user preferences and values.",
  "takeaways": "This research paper focuses on \"ascertainable fairness\" in Algorithmic Decision Making (ADM), which translates to giving users tools to understand and challenge AI's decisions. For JavaScript developers building LLM-based multi-agent web apps, this translates into several practical considerations:\n\n**1. Fairness of Predictions (Component C1): Building a \"Fairness Dashboard\"**\n\n* **Concept:** Allow users to explore how different attributes influence the LLM's predictions.  This involves creating a transparent view into how the LLM's output changes when input attributes are tweaked.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * **Frontend:**  Use a framework like React or Vue.js to create an interactive interface.  Users can adjust sliders representing different input attributes (e.g., loan amount, income for a loan application). The interface would display the LLM's prediction in real-time and highlight how changes in input affect the outcome.  Charts (e.g., using Chart.js or D3.js) can visualize these relationships.\n    * **Backend:** Node.js can handle communication with the LLM.  Libraries like TensorFlow.js or ONNX.js could be used for local model execution and analysis if you're not using a cloud-based LLM API.\n* **Example:**  In a multi-agent loan application system, one agent could gather user data, another agent could interact with the LLM for prediction, and a third agent could present this information (and counterfactuals) on the fairness dashboard.\n\n**2. Fairness of Recourse (Component C2): \"What-If\" Scenarios and Actionable Advice**\n\n* **Concept:**  Provide users with specific, achievable steps to improve their outcome if the LLM's initial decision is unfavorable.  This is related to counterfactual explanations â€“ \"If you had X, the outcome would likely be Y.\"\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * **Frontend:** Continue using React/Vue.js.  Based on the LLM's output, display actionable recommendations (e.g., \"Increase your credit score by 50 points,\" \"Provide additional proof of income\").\n    * **Backend:** The backend would calculate these \"recourses\" by strategically querying the LLM with modified inputs. Libraries like \"AIF360\" (though primarily Python, its concepts are adaptable to JavaScript) can inspire the logic for recourse generation.\n* **Example:** In a multi-agent job application system, one agent could analyze the user's resume and another agent could use the LLM to predict the likelihood of getting an interview. If the prediction is low, the system could offer concrete advice: \"Improve your resume by adding keywords X, Y, and Z\" or \"Highlight projects related to technology A.\"\n\n\n**3. Contestability (Component C3): Integrating Feedback and Dispute Mechanisms**\n\n* **Concept:**  Allow users to challenge the LLM's decision and provide feedback.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * **Frontend:** Create feedback forms (using React/Vue.js) allowing users to express concerns about specific attributes, the fairness metric used, or the decision itself.\n    * **Backend:** Store this feedback and potentially use it to retrain the LLM or adjust its parameters. This connects to the research paper's idea of a \"contestation dialogue.\"  You might create a dedicated agent for managing contestations, routing them to human experts if needed.\n* **Example:** A user might contest a low credit score prediction by claiming that a critical piece of information (e.g., stable employment history) was not properly considered.\n\n\n**4. Audit Mechanism (Component C4): Logging and Transparency**\n\n* **Concept:**  Maintain a detailed log of all LLM interactions and decisions for transparency and potential audits.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * **Backend:** Implement robust logging using Node.js and a database (e.g., MongoDB). Store input attributes, LLM output, explanations, recourses, and user feedback. This log becomes essential for regulatory compliance and demonstrates a commitment to fairness.\n* **Example:** In a multi-agent e-commerce system using LLMs for product recommendations, the audit log could record which products were recommended to which users, the reasons behind the recommendations, and any user feedback related to the recommendations' fairness.\n\n\n**JavaScript Libraries and Frameworks:**\n\n* **Frontend:** React, Vue.js, Angular, Chart.js, D3.js.\n* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, TensorFlow.js, ONNX.js.\n\n\nBy incorporating these practical steps, JavaScript developers can move beyond simply using LLMs to creating multi-agent systems that are both powerful and demonstrably fair.  This approach aligns with the increasing emphasis on responsible AI and the user's right to understand and challenge automated decisions.",
