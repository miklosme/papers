  "title": "PokéChamp: an Expert-level Minimax Language Agent",
  "abstract": "We introduce PokéChamp, a minimax agent powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) for Pokémon battles. Built on a general framework for two-player competitive games, PokéChamp leverages the generalist capabilities of LLMs to enhance minimax tree search. Specifically, LLMs replace three key modules: (1) player action sampling, (2) opponent modeling, and (3) value function estimation, enabling the agent to effectively utilize gameplay history and human knowledge to reduce the search space and address partial observability. Notably, our framework requires no additional LLM training. We evaluate PokéChamp in the popular Gen 9 OU format. When powered by GPT-40, it achieves a win rate of 76% against the best existing LLM-based bot and 84% against the strongest rule-based bot, demonstrating its superior performance. Even with an open-source 8-billion-parameter Llama 3.1 model, PokéChamp consistently outperforms the previous best LLM-based bot, Pokéllmon powered by GPT-40, with a 64% win rate. PokéChamp attains a projected Elo of 1300-1500 on the Pokémon Showdown online ladder, placing it among the top 30%-10% of human players. In addition, this work compiles the largest real-player Pokémon battle dataset, featuring over 3 million games, including more than 500k high-Elo matches. Based on this dataset, we establish a series of battle benchmarks and puzzles to evaluate specific battling skills. We further provide key updates to the local game engine. We hope this work fosters further research that leverage Pokémon battle as benchmark to integrate LLM technologies with game-theoretic algorithms addressing general multiagent problems.

  "summary": "This paper introduces PokéChamp, an AI agent that plays Pokémon at an expert level by combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with the minimax tree search algorithm.  The LLM enhances the search by suggesting player actions, predicting opponent actions, and estimating the value of game states, effectively incorporating strategic knowledge and handling the game's partial observability.  Notably for multi-agent systems development, PokéChamp's framework uses the LLM as a black box, requires no LLM fine-tuning, and is generally applicable to two-player zero-sum games.  Evaluation shows strong performance against other bots, including another LLM-based agent, and competitive performance against human players online.  The research also contributes a large Pokémon battle dataset and benchmarks for evaluating agent performance.",
  "takeaways": "This paper provides several valuable insights for JavaScript developers working on LLM-based multi-agent AI projects, especially in web development scenarios:\n\n**1. Minimax with LLM Augmentation:**\n\n* **Concept:** Instead of pure minimax, which can be computationally expensive, use LLMs to enhance three key areas: player action sampling (reducing branching factor), opponent modeling (handling partial observability), and value function estimation (approximating game outcomes).\n* **Practical Example:**  Imagine building a multi-agent web game like Diplomacy. Instead of exhaustively exploring all possible actions, use an LLM to propose a smaller subset of plausible moves for each agent based on the game state.  This can be done by sending a prompt to the LLM describing the current board state and asking for a few likely moves. This limits the search space while maintaining strategic depth. Libraries like `langchain.js` can simplify LLM interaction.\n\n```javascript\n// Simplified example using langchain.js\nconst { LLMChain, PromptTemplate } = require(\"langchain\");\nconst { OpenAI } = require(\"langchain/llms/openai\");\n\nconst llm = new OpenAI({ temperature: 0.9 }); // Your LLM\n\nconst template = \"Given the game state: {gameState}, suggest 3 plausible moves for player {playerId}\";\nconst prompt = new PromptTemplate({\n  template: template,\n  inputVariables: [\"gameState\", \"playerId\"],\n});\n\nconst chain = new LLMChain({ llm: llm, prompt: prompt });\n\n// ... inside your game loop ...\nchain.call({ gameState: currentGameState, playerId: currentPlayer }).then((res) => {\n  const suggestedMoves = res.text.split('\\n');\n  // Use these suggestedMoves in your minimax search\n});\n```\n\n**2. Opponent Modeling with Partial Observability:**\n\n* **Concept:**  Use LLMs and historical data to infer hidden information about opponents, addressing partial observability challenges.\n* **Practical Example:** In a real-time strategy game, an LLM can predict the opponent's base layout or unit composition based on visible actions and typical strategies observed in previous games.  This prediction can inform your agent's decision-making. Store game data in a database (e.g., MongoDB) and use it to fine-tune your LLM's predictions or create specific prompts based on historical patterns.\n\n**3. Approximate State Transition:**\n\n* **Concept:** Simplify complex game mechanics with approximate models and use readily available heuristics (like \"time to knockout\" in the paper) to improve decision speed.\n* **Practical Example:**  For a complex trading simulation, instead of simulating every market transaction, use an approximate model based on average trading volumes and price fluctuations.  This allows faster evaluations within the minimax search.  Combine this with heuristics like predicted profit margins to guide your agents' trading decisions.\n\n**4. Battle Testing and Puzzles:**\n\n* **Concept:**  Develop benchmark puzzles and arena-style competitions to test your multi-agent system rigorously.\n* **Practical Example:** Create unit testing scenarios for your multi-agent system. Test individual agent behaviors against predefined opponent strategies.  Use game logs to identify weaknesses and improve your agent's decision-making.  You can use testing frameworks like Jest or Mocha.  For more complex scenarios, develop a web-based testing interface using a framework like React or Vue.js.\n\n**5. Iterative Development and Evaluation:**\n\n* **Concept:**  The paper emphasizes the importance of iterative development and testing.  Don't expect perfection on the first try.  Continuously evaluate, analyze game logs, and refine your agents.\n* **Practical Example:** Set up a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate testing and deployment of your multi-agent system.  Analyze game logs using visualization tools to understand agent behavior.  Use A/B testing to compare different versions of your agents.\n\n\nBy integrating these insights into your development workflow, you can create more sophisticated and efficient LLM-based multi-agent AI applications, especially in the dynamic and partially observable environments common in web development.  The examples provided show how JavaScript frameworks and libraries can be used to put these concepts into practice. Remember to choose an LLM appropriate for your budget and computational resources.",
