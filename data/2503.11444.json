  "title": "Cerebrum (AIOS SDK): A Platform for Agent Development, Deployment, Distribution, and Discovery",
  "abstract": "Autonomous LLM-based agents have emerged as a powerful paradigm for complex task execution, yet the field lacks standardized tools for development, deployment, distribution, and discovery of agents. We present Cerebrum, an Agent SDK for AIOS that addresses this gap through three key components: (1) a comprehensive SDK featuring a modular four-layer architecture for agent development, encompassing LLM, memory, storage, and tool management; (2) a community-driven Agent Hub for sharing and discovering agents, complete with version control and dependency management; (3) an interactive web interface for testing and evaluating agents. The platform's effectiveness is demonstrated through implementations of various agent architectures, including Chain of Thought (CoT), ReAct, and tool-use agents. Cerebrum advances the field by providing a unified framework that standardizes agent development while maintaining flexibility for researchers and developers to innovate and distribute their agents. The live website is at https://app.aios.foundation, the code is at https://github.com/agiresearch/Cerebrum, and video https://app.aios.foundation/video-demo.",
  "summary": "Cerebrum is a new platform (SDK and Agent Hub website) for building, sharing, and using large language model (LLM)-based AI agents. It features a modular design, version control, dependency management, and simplifies complex agent development for various tasks like reasoning, tool use, and memory management. Relevant to LLM-based multi-agent systems are its standardized framework, focus on composability, agent specifications for behavior and resource management, and the centralized hub for community sharing and discovery.",
  "takeaways": "This paper introduces Cerebrum, a platform for developing, deploying, and distributing LLM-based agents. Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights to their multi-agent AI projects:\n\n**1. Modular Agent Development with JavaScript:**\n\n* **Cerebrum's Four-Layer Architecture:**  Translate this into a JavaScript class structure. Each layer (LLM, Memory, Storage, Tool) can be a separate class or module.  This promotes code reusability and maintainability.\n    ```javascript\n    class LLMLayer {\n      constructor(model) { this.model = model; }\n      async query(prompt) { /* ... interact with LLM API ... */ }\n    }\n\n    class MemoryLayer {\n      constructor(size) { this.memory = []; this.maxSize = size; }\n      add(item) { /* ... manage memory with LRU-k ... */ }\n    }\n\n    class Agent {\n      constructor(llm, memory) { this.llm = llm; this.memory = memory; }\n      async act(observation) { /* ... agent logic using llm and memory ... */ }\n    }\n\n    // Example usage\n    const llm = new LLMLayer(\"gpt-3.5-turbo\");\n    const memory = new MemoryLayer(10);\n    const agent = new Agent(llm, memory); \n    ```\n\n* **LangChainJS and LlamaIndex:**  Leverage these JavaScript libraries, which provide abstractions for building agents with LLMs.  Map Cerebrumâ€™s concepts to LangChain modules (LLMs, Prompts, Chains, Tools, Agents) or LlamaIndex data structures.\n\n**2. Agent Communication and Coordination:**\n\n* **Message Passing:** Implement agent communication using message queues (e.g., Redis, RabbitMQ) or WebSockets.  Define clear message formats (JSON) for tasks, responses, and internal agent states.  This is essential for multi-agent collaboration.\n* **Agent Hub Concept:** Though Cerebrum's hub is Python-based,  consider building a simplified JavaScript version using Node.js and Express.  This local hub can manage agent registration, discovery, and basic versioning.\n\n**3.  Web Application Integration:**\n\n* **Frontend Development:** Design a user interface (React, Vue, Angular) to interact with the multi-agent system. Display agent conversations, visualize agent states, and allow users to assign tasks or manage agents.\n* **Backend Integration:**  Use Node.js and Express to expose API endpoints for agent interactions.  Handle user requests, route them to appropriate agents, and return agent responses to the frontend.\n\n\n**4. Practical Examples and Scenarios:**\n\n* **E-commerce chatbot:** Develop a multi-agent system for customer support.  One agent handles product inquiries, another manages order tracking, and a third offers personalized recommendations.\n* **Collaborative writing tool:**  Build an application where multiple agents assist users in writing. One agent suggests content, another checks grammar, and a third provides research.\n* **Game AI:** Create a game with AI-powered agents that interact strategically. Use Cerebrum's concepts to develop individual agent behaviors and then manage interactions.\n\n**5. Experimenting with JavaScript Libraries:**\n\n* **LangChainJS Tools and Agents:** Explore LangChainJS's tools to build agents that access external resources (search engines, APIs). Implement a ReAct-style agent in JavaScript using tools.\n* **LlamaIndex Data Structures:** Experiment with LlamaIndex to create agents that interact with large amounts of indexed information.\n\n\nBy combining the theoretical foundation of Cerebrum with the flexibility of JavaScript and the power of libraries like LangChainJS and LlamaIndex, developers can build sophisticated LLM-based multi-agent systems for various web applications. Remember to focus on modular design, communication strategies, and user interface integration to create truly impactful multi-agent web experiences.",
  "pseudocode": "The paper contains several mathematical expressions that represent algorithms or processes, but not formal pseudocode blocks.  However, these expressions can be translated into JavaScript-like representations along with explanations.\n\n**1. Baseline Chatbot (Equation 1):**\n\n```javascript\nfunction baselineChatbot(x, llm) {\n  const prompt = generatePrompt(x); // Function to create the prompt string\n  const y = llm(prompt);  // Call the LLM function (assumed provided)\n  return y;\n}\n\nfunction generatePrompt(x) {\n  return x; // Basic prompt generation - just uses the input directly\n}\n\n// Example usage (assuming 'myLLM' is your LLM function):\nlet userInput = \"What is the capital of France?\";\nlet response = baselineChatbot(userInput, myLLM);\nconsole.log(response); // Expected output (from LLM):  \"Paris\"\n```\n\n* **Explanation:** This represents a simple chatbot that directly passes the user input `x` to the large language model (LLM) without any intermediate processing. The `generatePrompt` function in this basic version just returns the input unchanged. The LLM (represented by the `myLLM` function in the example) is treated as a black box that takes a prompt string and returns a response.\n\n**2. Chain of Thought Agent (Equation 2 & 3):**\n\n```javascript\nasync function chainOfThoughtAgent(x, llm) {\n  let prompt = \"Let's approach this step by step: \" + x;\n  let reasoningSteps = [];\n  let currentStep = prompt;\n\n  for (let i = 0; i < MAX_REASONING_STEPS; i++) {  // Limit reasoning steps\n      let si = await llm(currentStep);\n      reasoningSteps.push(si);\n\n      if (isFinalAnswer(si)) { // Function to check for final answer\n          return extractAnswer(si); // Function to extract final answer from si\n      }\n\n      currentStep = currentStep + \"\\n\" + si + \"\\nNext step:\";\n  }\n\n    return \"Could not find an answer after multiple reasoning steps.\"\n\n}\n\n\n// Example functions (you would need to implement these based on LLM output format):\n\nfunction isFinalAnswer(step) {\n  // Implement logic to detect when LLM has given final answer.\n  // Example: return step.includes(\"Final Answer:\");\n  return false; \n}\n\nfunction extractAnswer(step) {\n  // Implement logic to extract the answer from the LLM output.\n  // Example: return step.split(\"Final Answer:\")[1].trim();\n  return \"\";\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nlet userQuestion = \"What is 2 multiplied by 3, then added to 5?\";\nlet cotAnswer = await chainOfThoughtAgent(userQuestion, myLLM);\nconsole.log(cotAnswer);\n```\n\n* **Explanation:** This simulates a Chain of Thought agent.  It initializes the prompt with \"Let's approach this step by step:\" and then iteratively adds the LLM's output (intermediate reasoning steps) to the prompt for the next step.  The loop continues until a maximum number of steps (`MAX_REASONING_STEPS`) is reached, or the `isFinalAnswer` function detects a final answer in the LLM's output. The `extractAnswer` function extracts the final answer from the LLM output based on its expected format. You will have to define the `isFinalAnswer` and `extractAnswer` functions yourself, as the LLM's way of outputting a final answer is not defined in this context.\n\n\n\n\n**3. ReAct Agent (Equations 4, 5, and 6):**\n\nThe ReAct agent implementation is more complex because it requires defining a state space, action space, a transition function, and a policy.  Converting this to concrete JavaScript would require significant assumptions about the environment, tools available, and how the LLM interacts with them.  A high-level sketch is provided:\n\n\n\n```javascript\nclass ReActAgent {\n    constructor(llm) {\n        this.llm = llm;\n        this.state = { context: \"\", history: [] }; // Initial state\n    }\n\n    async act(userInput) {\n        this.state.context = userInput; // Update context with user input\n\n        for (let i = 0; i < MAX_STEPS; i++) {\n            const action = await this.policy(this.state); // Get action from policy\n\n            this.state.history.push({state: this.state, action: action});  // Store for history analysis\n\n\n            this.state = this.transition(this.state, action); // Update state based on action and potentially LLM calls\n\n           if (this.isTerminalState(this.state)){ //Checks if a terminal state is reached.\n               return extractFinalAnswer(this.state);\n           }\n\n\n\n        }\n\n        return \"Could not find answer after maximum number of steps.\";\n    }\n\n\n    async policy(state) { // Simplified policy (needs significant expansion)\n\n        const prompt = `Context: ${state.context}\\nHistory: ${JSON.stringify(state.history)}\\nChoose an action: Thought, Action, Observation`; // Example prompt\n\n\n        const action = await this.llm(prompt);  // Call LLM for action choice\n\n        return action.trim(); // Return the chosen action\n    }\n\n\n    transition(state, action) { // Placeholder - needs to be implemented based on your system\n\n      let newState = {...state};\n\n       if (action === \"Thought\") {\n          // Implement Thought transition logic, call LLM if necessary, update newState\n\n       }  else if (action === \"Action\") {\n          // Implement Action transition logic (e.g., tool usage), update newState\n\n\n       } else if (action === \"Observation\") {\n          // Implement Observation transition logic (e.g., get feedback from environment), update newState\n\n       }\n\n        return newState;\n    }\n\n\n    isTerminalState(state) { // Checks if current state is terminal. Define the conditions for your task.\n\n        // Example implementation\n        return state.history.length > 0 && state.history[state.history.length -1].action === \"Final Answer:\"\n\n\n    }\n\n\n}\n\n```\n\n\n* **Explanation:**  This simplified structure shows how a ReAct agent might be organized in JavaScript.  The `act` function is the main loop, choosing actions based on the current state using the `policy` function.  The `transition` function updates the state based on the chosen action. These would need to be fleshed out considerably based on your specific task, the available tools, and the structure of the LLM interaction. The policy function uses the context, current state, and history of state transitions to determine the next action through an LLM call.  The  `transition` function represents environment interaction and should be carefully designed. The `isTerminalState` function is to determine if a terminal state is reached, which would terminate the loop, returning the final answer. You would need to define how this function determines a terminal state based on your task.  The LLM (represented by `this.llm`) is called by both the `policy` and potentially by `transition` (if Thought actions involve LLM interaction).\n\n\n\n**4. Tool-Augmented Agent:**\n\nSimilar to the ReAct agent, a full JavaScript implementation would require significantly more detail about the tools, the LLM, and their interface. It follows the same general hierarchical process outlined in the paper.  Key components would be functions for tool selection (`fselect`), parameter generation (`fparams`), tool execution (`execute`), and response generation (`frespond`).  These would all involve interactions with the LLM and the specific tools you are using.\n\n\n\nIt's important to understand that these are just conceptual outlines.  A practical implementation of these multi-agent systems using LLMs requires much more context and detail about the specific LLM you're using, the environment, available tools, and the desired behavior of the agents.",
