  "title": "Enhancing Clinical Trial Patient Matching through Knowledge Augmentation with Multi-Agents",
  "abstract": "Matching patients effectively and efficiently for clinical trials is a significant challenge due to the complexity and variability of patient profiles and trial criteria. This paper presents a novel framework, Multi-Agents for Knowledge Augmentation (MAKA), designed to enhance patient-trial matching by dynamically supplementing matching prompts with external, domain-specific knowledge. The MAKA architecture consists of five key components: a knowledge probing agent that detects gaps in domain knowledge, a navigation agent that manages interactions among multiple specialized knowledge augmentation agents, a knowledge augmentation agent that incorporates relevant information into patient-trial matching prompts, a supervision agent aligning the outputs from other agents with the instructions and a matching agent making the final selection decision. This approach enhances the accuracy and contextual richness of patient matching, addresses inherent knowledge gaps in both trail criteria and large language models (LLMs), and improves the alignment between patient characteristics and the criteria.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces MAKA, a multi-agent framework designed to improve patient matching for clinical trials using LLMs. MAKA uses multiple agents to augment trial criteria with external knowledge, addressing gaps in both the criteria and LLM understanding.  Key points relevant to LLM-based multi-agent systems include: the use of specialized agents for knowledge probing, navigation, augmentation, and supervision; the dynamic integration of domain-specific knowledge to enhance LLM understanding; and the demonstration of improved performance in a patient-matching task compared to baseline LLM approaches.",
  "takeaways": "This paper introduces MAKA, a multi-agent system for augmenting LLMs in clinical trial patient matching. Here are some practical examples of how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights to broader LLM-based multi-agent AI projects, focusing on web development scenarios:\n\n**1. Knowledge Probing Agent:**\n\n* **Scenario:** A web app helps users find relevant information based on complex queries.  The LLM sometimes misinterprets nuanced queries or lacks specific domain knowledge.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**  Before sending a query to the LLM (e.g., OpenAI API), implement a probing agent using JavaScript. This agent could use regular expressions or a smaller, specialized LLM to analyze the user's query.  If the query lacks key information or uses ambiguous terms, the agent can prompt the user for clarification or add contextual keywords.  LangChain's Prompt Templates can structure these probes.\n\n```javascript\n// Simplified example using regex\nconst probeAgent = (query) => {\n  if (!query.match(/specific_keyword/)) {\n    return \"Please provide more details about [missing concept]\";\n  }\n  return null; // No probe needed\n};\n\nconst userQuery = \"Find information on latest treatments\";\nconst probe = probeAgent(userQuery);\n\nif (probe) {\n  // Prompt user for more information using probe\n} else {\n  // Send query to LLM\n}\n```\n\n**2. Navigation Agent:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  An e-commerce site uses multiple LLMs: one for product recommendations, another for sentiment analysis of reviews, and a third for generating marketing copy.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**  A Navigation Agent written in JavaScript, using a library like LangChain Agents, can decide which LLM to use based on the user's actions (e.g., viewing a product, writing a review). The agent acts as a router, directing requests to the appropriate LLM and managing the flow of information between them.\n\n**3. Knowledge Augmentation Agent:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  A web app provides personalized learning recommendations. The LLM struggles with rapidly evolving topics.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**  Create a JavaScript Knowledge Augmentation Agent that uses external APIs (e.g., Wikipedia API, a research database API) or vector databases (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate) to fetch up-to-date information. This information is added to the LLM prompt to ensure its responses are current and relevant.\n\n```javascript\n// Simplified example using an external API\nconst augmentPrompt = async (query) => {\n  const latestInfo = await fetch(\"some_api_endpoint\" + query).then(res => res.json());\n  return `${query}. Latest information: ${latestInfo.summary}`;\n};\n```\n\n\n**4. Supervision Agent:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  A chatbot built with an LLM sometimes generates responses that are off-topic or inappropriate.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**  A Supervision Agent in JavaScript can monitor the LLM's output using techniques like sentiment analysis libraries or by checking against a predefined list of forbidden terms. If a violation is detected, the agent can flag the response, modify it, or request a new response from the LLM.\n\n**5. Matching Agent (in a broader context):**\n\n* **Scenario:**  A job board matches candidates with open positions.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**  The Matching Agent, leveraging an LLM, can compare candidate profiles (skills, experience) with job descriptions.  Vector embeddings created using libraries like TensorFlow.js can represent both candidates and jobs. Similarity search functions then efficiently find the best matches.\n\n**JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries:**\n\n* **LangChain:**  Simplifies working with LLMs and building chains and agents.\n* **TensorFlow.js:** Provides tools for working with embeddings and similarity searches.\n* **Node.js with Express or similar frameworks:**  For building backend services for the agents.\n* **React, Vue, or Angular:** For creating interactive front-end interfaces.\n* **Vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate, etc.):**  For efficiently storing and querying embeddings.\n\n\nBy combining these building blocks, JavaScript developers can create sophisticated multi-agent systems that leverage the power of LLMs while addressing their limitations.  The key takeaway from the MAKA paper is the importance of modular design, enabling developers to  improve LLM performance by dynamically augmenting its knowledge and supervising its behavior through specialized agents. This principle extends far beyond clinical trial matching and applies to a wide range of web development applications utilizing LLMs.",
