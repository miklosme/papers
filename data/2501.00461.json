  "title": "Efficient support ticket resolution using Knowledge Graphs",
  "abstract": "A review of over 160,000 customer cases indicates that about 90% of time is spent by the product support for solving around 10% of subset of tickets where a trivial solution may not exist. Many of these challenging cases require the support of several engineers working together within a \"swarm\", and some also need to go to development support as bugs. These challenging customer issues represent a major opportunity for machine learning and knowledge graph that identifies the ideal engineer / group of engineers (swarm) that can best address the solution, reducing the wait times for the customer. The concrete ML task we consider here is a learning-to-rank (LTR) task that given an incident and a set of engineers currently assigned to the incident (which might be the empty set in the non-swarming context), produce a ranked list of engineers best fit to help resolve that incident. To calculate the rankings, we may consider a wide variety of input features including the incident description provided by the customer, the affected component(s), engineer ratings of their expertise, knowledge base article text written by engineers, response to customer text written by engineers, and historic swarming data. The central hypothesis test is that by including a holistic set of contextual data around which cases an engineer has solved, we can significantly improve the LTR algorithm over benchmark models. The article proposes a novel approach of modeling Knowledge Graph embeddings from multiple data sources, including the swarm information. The results obtained proves that by incorporating this additional context, we can improve the recommendations significantly over traditional machine learning methods like TF-IDF.",
  "summary": "This paper proposes a system for efficiently resolving customer support tickets by recommending the best-suited engineers or engineering teams (\"swarms\").  It leverages knowledge graphs, graph neural networks (GNNs), and natural language understanding (NLU) including very large language models (VLLMs) to analyze ticket content, engineer expertise, past collaborations (swarms), and knowledge base articles.\n\nKey points for LLM-based multi-agent systems:\n\n* **LLMs for Rich Contextualization:** VLLMs are used to process text from tickets, communications, and KBAs, generating rich contextual embeddings for both agents (engineers) and tasks (tickets).\n* **Knowledge Graph for Agent Relationships:**  A knowledge graph represents relationships between engineers, tickets, and KBAs, enabling the system to learn from past collaborations and expertise.\n* **GNNs for Agent Ranking:** GNNs operating on the knowledge graph produce dynamic agent embeddings that capture their expertise and collaboration history, facilitating a learning-to-rank approach.\n* **Multi-Agent Collaboration (Swarming):** The system specifically addresses scenarios where multiple agents need to collaborate to solve complex tickets, leveraging swarm data for training.\n* **Dynamic Agent Selection:** The proposed model allows for dynamic recommendations, taking into account the current state of the ticket and who is already working on it.",
  "takeaways": "This research paper presents valuable insights for JavaScript developers working with LLM-based multi-agent systems in web development. Here's how its concepts can be practically applied:\n\n**1. Building a Knowledge Graph:**\n\n* **Data Sources:** In a web app context, the knowledge graph can be populated from diverse sources like user interactions, product catalogs, support tickets (as the paper suggests), documentation, and even social media sentiment.\n* **JavaScript Libraries:**  Use libraries like `vis.js`, `Cytoscape.js`, or `D3.js` to visualize and interact with the knowledge graph in the browser. For backend graph databases, consider Neo4j or Amazon Neptune, accessible through their respective JavaScript drivers.\n* **Example:** In an e-commerce site, the graph could represent products, categories, user preferences, and purchase history.  This graph can then power multi-agent systems for personalized recommendations, dynamic pricing, or chatbot interactions.\n\n```javascript\n// Example using vis.js (simplified)\nconst nodes = new vis.DataSet([\n  { id: 1, label: \"Product A\" },\n  { id: 2, label: \"Category X\" },\n  { id: 3, label: \"User 1\" }\n]);\nconst edges = new vis.DataSet([\n  { from: 1, to: 2 }, // Product A belongs to Category X\n  { from: 3, to: 1 }  // User 1 likes Product A\n]);\nconst data = { nodes, edges };\nconst network = new vis.Network(container, data, options);\n```\n\n**2. Implementing NLU with LLMs:**\n\n* **LLM Integration:** Leverage cloud-based LLM APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Cohere, or Hugging Face Inference API) within your JavaScript code to process text from the knowledge graph, user queries, or support tickets.\n* **Example:** Extract key features from user reviews using an LLM, then embed those features as nodes or properties within the knowledge graph. This enriched graph becomes a valuable resource for sentiment analysis, product improvement, and agent decision-making.\n* **Client-side or Server-side:**  Consider performance implications. For complex or real-time processing, server-side execution using Node.js is preferable. For simpler tasks, client-side processing within the browser can improve responsiveness.\n\n```javascript\n// Example using OpenAI API (simplified â€“ requires API key)\nasync function getEmbedding(text) {\n  const response = await fetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings', {\n    method: 'POST',\n    headers: {\n      'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n      'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'\n    },\n    body: JSON.stringify({\n      input: text,\n      model: 'text-embedding-ada-002' // Example model\n    })\n  });\n  const data = await response.json();\n  return data.data[0].embedding;\n}\n```\n\n**3. Building Multi-Agent Systems:**\n\n* **Agent Communication:**  Design agents that interact with the knowledge graph and each other. WebSockets (using libraries like `Socket.IO`) provide real-time communication channels for agent coordination.\n* **Agent Framework:** Consider using agent-based modeling libraries like `sarl` (though typically Java-based, interoperability could be explored) or build custom agent logic within your JavaScript framework (React, Vue, Angular).\n* **Example:**  Build a multi-agent system where one agent specializes in product information retrieval from the knowledge graph, another handles user requests, and a third agent manages order fulfillment. These agents collaborate to provide a seamless user experience.\n\n\n**4. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with JavaScript:**\n\n* **Challenges:** Implementing GNNs directly in JavaScript can be challenging due to the computational complexity and limited library support. However, explore TensorFlow.js or WebGPU for potential client-side solutions. For more robust GNN implementation, a server-side approach using Python libraries like PyTorch Geometric or Deep Graph Library, accessible via APIs, might be more practical.\n\n\n**5. Ranking and Recommendations:**\n\n* **Implementing Learning-to-Rank:** Leverage JavaScript machine learning libraries like `TensorFlow.js` or `Brain.js` to implement ranking algorithms based on the paper's LTR approach. The LLM embeddings from the NLU stage become valuable features for training these ranking models.\n* **Example:** Rank search results, product recommendations, or expert suggestions based on user context and information from the knowledge graph.\n\n\nBy combining these techniques, JavaScript developers can effectively build LLM-based multi-agent systems for diverse web applications, leveraging the insights from the research paper to create more intelligent, responsive, and personalized user experiences.  Remember to start with a well-defined scope and incrementally add complexity as you gain experience with these technologies.",

The algorithm leverages a knowledge graph and natural language understanding (NLU) techniques.\n\n1. **Data Extraction and Transformation:** The process begins by extracting and transforming data from various sources like KBAs, communication logs, component descriptions, user data, and swarm information.\n\n2. **NLU Processing:** NLU techniques (e.g., transformer models like BERT) are applied to the text-based data (KBAs, communication logs, component descriptions) to generate embeddings that capture semantic meaning.\n\n3. **Embedding Normalization:** The generated embeddings are normalized into vectors.\n\n4. **Knowledge Graph Construction:** A knowledge graph is constructed using the normalized vectors as nodes.  Edges represent relationships between different entities (e.g., users who worked on the same incident, users who authored KBAs, KBAs related to components).  Libraries like NetworkX could be employed for this purpose.\n\n5. **Ranking Module (PinSage):** The PinSage algorithm, a graph convolutional neural network designed for web-scale recommendations, is used to generate embeddings for the new incident. These embeddings are used to query the knowledge graph to find the most similar engineers based on their past experience and expertise.\n\n6. **Ranking Engineers:**  The algorithm ranks engineers based on similarity to the new incident, effectively recommending the most suitable engineers to address the issue. The paper suggests using a triplet loss function to measure similarity and perform the ranking.\n\n\nThis JavaScript code provides a high-level structure for implementing the proposed algorithm.  Specific implementations of data extraction, transformation, NLU models, and knowledge graph construction would need to be adapted based on the specific data and available resources. The use of a library like NetworkX is recommended for creating and managing the Knowledge Graph.  Similarly, pre-trained NLU models and specialized libraries for graph neural networks (e.g., Deep Graph Library (DGL), PyTorch Geometric) would need to be integrated to build a complete working solution.",
