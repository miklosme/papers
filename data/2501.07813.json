  "title": "Talk to Right Specialists: Routing and Planning in Multi-agent System for Question Answering",
  "abstract": "Leveraging large language models (LLMs), an agent can utilize retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques to integrate external knowledge and increase the reliability of its responses. Current RAG-based agents integrate single, domain-specific knowledge sources, limiting their ability and leading to hallucinated or inaccurate responses when addressing cross-domain queries. Integrating multiple knowledge bases into a unified RAG-based agent raises significant challenges, including increased retrieval overhead and data sovereignty when sensitive data is involved. In this work, we propose RopMura, a novel multi-agent system that addresses these limitations by incorporating highly efficient routing and planning mechanisms. RopMura features two key components: a router that intelligently selects the most relevant agents based on knowledge boundaries and a planner that decomposes complex multi-hop queries into manageable steps, allowing for coordinating cross-domain responses. Experimental results demonstrate that RopMura effectively handles both single-hop and multi-hop queries, with the routing mechanism enabling precise answers for single-hop queries and the combined routing and planning mechanisms achieving accurate, multi-step resolutions for complex queries.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces RopMura, a multi-agent system for question answering that uses multiple specialized Large Language Models (LLMs) augmented with retrieval (RAG).  Each agent has its own knowledge base and expertise.  RopMura addresses the challenges of efficiently routing questions to the right agents and planning multi-step reasoning across different knowledge domains. Key points for LLM-based multi-agent systems include a novel routing mechanism based on knowledge clustering and similarity comparison, and a flexible, iterative planning strategy that decomposes complex queries and dynamically adjusts to new information, overcoming limitations of existing rigid or single-agent approaches.  This enables effective collaboration between specialized LLMs without sharing the underlying data, addressing knowledge sovereignty concerns.",
  "takeaways": "This paper introduces RopMura, a multi-agent system using routing and planning mechanisms to improve LLM-based question answering. Here are some practical examples of how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights in LLM-based multi-agent web applications:\n\n**1. Building a Customer Support Chatbot with Specialized Agents:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine an e-commerce site selling diverse products (electronics, clothing, furniture). Instead of a single chatbot, you want specialized agents for each category.\n* **RopMura Application:**  Implement a router in JavaScript that analyzes incoming user queries using a natural language processing (NLP) library like Compromise or Natural.  Based on keywords (e.g., \"TV,\" \"dress,\" \"sofa\"), the router directs the query to the appropriate LLM-powered agent (e.g., electronics agent, clothing agent). Each agent has its own knowledge base (product catalog, FAQs) and uses a JavaScript LLM integration library like `langchain-js` or `transformers.js`.\n* **Benefits:** Improved response accuracy and relevance, reduced response time, easier maintenance of separate knowledge bases.\n\n**2. Collaborative Content Creation Platform:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Multiple users contribute to a single document, each specializing in a different area (e.g., writing, editing, fact-checking).\n* **RopMura Application:** Design a planning mechanism in JavaScript.  When a user initiates a task (e.g., \"write an article about climate change\"), the planner breaks it down into subtasks (research, drafting, editing, fact-checking). Each subtask is assigned to a specialized LLM agent. The agents communicate through a message queue implemented using libraries like Socket.IO or Redis.\n* **Benefits:** Streamlined workflow, improved collaboration, higher quality output.\n\n**3. Personalized Learning Platform:**\n\n* **Scenario:** A platform offering courses on various topics. Each learner has a different learning style and pace.\n* **RopMura Application:**  Implement a router and planner in JavaScript.  The router analyzes the learner's profile and past performance to select the most relevant learning materials and exercises. The planner creates a personalized learning path, breaking down complex topics into smaller, manageable steps.  LLM agents provide personalized feedback and guidance.\n* **Benefits:** Personalized learning experience, improved learning outcomes, increased learner engagement.\n\n**4. Interactive Storytelling Application:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Users participate in creating a branching narrative, with multiple LLM agents playing different characters.\n* **RopMura Application:** The planner in JavaScript manages the overall story arc and ensures consistency. The router assigns user actions to different character agents, based on their roles and relationships.  LLM agents generate responses based on their character's personality and the current story state. Libraries like `node-fetch` or Axios can be used for communication between agents.\n* **Benefits:** Engaging and dynamic storytelling experience, emergent narratives, improved user participation.\n\n**JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries:**\n\n* **LLM Integration:** `langchain-js`, `transformers.js`\n* **NLP:** Compromise, Natural\n* **Communication:** Socket.IO, Redis, `node-fetch`, Axios\n* **Frontend:** React, Vue, Angular\n* **Backend:** Node.js, Express\n\n**Key Considerations for JavaScript Developers:**\n\n* **Knowledge Base Representation:**  How to effectively represent and manage different knowledge bases for each agent in a JavaScript environment (e.g., JSON, databases).\n* **Agent Communication:** Design efficient communication protocols for agents to exchange information and coordinate actions.\n* **Routing Algorithm:**  Implement a robust and efficient routing algorithm in JavaScript, potentially using vector embeddings and similarity measures.\n* **Planning Algorithm:**  Develop a flexible and adaptive planning algorithm, handling complex multi-hop tasks.\n* **User Interface:** Design a user-friendly interface that integrates seamlessly with the multi-agent system.\n\nBy applying the principles of RopMura, JavaScript developers can create sophisticated LLM-based multi-agent web applications that offer enhanced functionality, personalized experiences, and improved collaboration.  This represents a significant step towards building more intelligent and dynamic web experiences.",
