  "title": "Interactionalism¹: Re-Designing Higher Learning for the Large Language Agent Era",
  "abstract": "We introduce Interactionalism as a new set of guiding principles and heuristics for the design and architecture of learning now available due to Generative AI (GenAI) platforms. Specifically, we articulate interactional intelligence as a net new skill set that is increasingly important when core cognitive tasks are automatable and augmentable by GenAI functions. We break down these skills into core sets of meta-cognitive and meta-emotional components and show how working with Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents can be proactively used to help develop learners. Interactionalism is not advanced as a theory of learning; but as a blueprint for the practice of learning - in coordination with GenAI. This approach is focused on explicit pedagogical moves, gestures and maneuvers that focus on the dialogical and dynamics of learning together with GenAI agents. The value of this approach is in anticipation of growing reliance on, and integration with, AI as a co-agent with humans, and an important factor in the production function of ‘skills’ and ‘knowledge’ across many domains.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces \"Interactionalism,\" a new learning framework for the age of Generative AI.  It argues that traditional educational models, focused on individual skill assessment and knowledge delivery, are no longer sufficient.  Instead, learners need to develop *interactional intelligence*: the ability to learn and work alongside AI agents, which requires strong meta-cognitive and meta-emotional skills.  The paper proposes shifting from individual production of work to *interactive production*, where learners collaborate with AI agents.  Evaluation should similarly focus on the *interaction* with AI agents, rather than just the final product.  This shift necessitates redesigned learning experiences, learner selection processes, and evaluation methods, leveraging LLMs' dialogical capabilities to provide \"always-on\" feedback and personalized learning.  Key to this approach is recognizing the increasing importance of not just cognitive and technical skills, but also social, relational, and meta-human skills needed for effective human-AI collaboration.",
  "takeaways": "This paper introduces \"Interactionalism,\" a framework for rethinking learning in the age of LLMs, focusing on developing \"interactional intelligence\" – the ability to effectively collaborate and learn with AI agents. Here's how JavaScript developers can apply these insights to LLM-based multi-agent AI projects:\n\n**1. Rethinking Traditional Web App Workflows:**\n\n* **Interactive Reading:** Instead of simply displaying text, create interfaces where users engage in a dialogue with an LLM to summarize, extract insights, and answer targeted questions. Imagine a news website where clicking a paragraph triggers a sidebar conversation with an LLM, providing context, related articles, and answering user queries. This can be implemented using JavaScript libraries like React or Vue.js for dynamic UI updates, and API calls to an LLM service.\n* **Collaborative Writing:** Integrate LLMs into writing tools, allowing users to co-create content. Think of a blog post editor that suggests titles, generates outlines, refines arguments, and even anticipates potential counter-arguments.  Frameworks like Draft.js or ProseMirror can be augmented with LLM integration using APIs like OpenAI's.\n* **Interactive Analysis:**  Empower users to analyze data dialogically. A dashboard could allow users to query an LLM about trends, explore different visualization options, and refine data filters collaboratively. Libraries like D3.js or Chart.js can be used to visually represent data, while an LLM handles the analytical conversation via JavaScript API calls.\n\n**2. Building Multi-Agent Web Applications:**\n\n* **Dialogical Agents for Personalized Learning:** Create web apps where LLM-powered agents act as tutors, providing personalized learning paths and feedback. Imagine a language learning app where different agents specialize in grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation, interacting with the learner and adapting to their progress in real-time.  Node.js and Socket.IO can enable real-time communication between agents and users within a browser environment.\n* **Multi-Agent Simulations:** Develop web-based simulations where multiple LLM agents interact to solve problems or simulate real-world scenarios. Consider a supply chain simulation where agents represent suppliers, manufacturers, and retailers, negotiating prices and managing inventory.  A JavaScript game engine like Phaser or Babylon.js could be leveraged to visualize the simulation, while agent behavior is controlled by individual LLMs communicating through a central server, potentially using a message queue like RabbitMQ.\n\n**3. Meta-Cognitive and Meta-Emotional Design:**\n\n* **Prompt Engineering as a Core Skill:** Treat prompt engineering as a key skill for JavaScript developers. Implement interactive prompt builders within web apps, allowing users to experiment and refine prompts for different LLM tasks.  Provide feedback on prompt effectiveness, encouraging meta-cognitive awareness of how prompts influence LLM behavior.  This can be done using React or Vue.js to create a user-friendly prompt building interface.\n* **Emotional Awareness in Agent Design:** Design agents with emotional awareness.  Use sentiment analysis libraries to assess user emotional states and adapt agent responses accordingly.  For example, a customer service bot could detect frustration and respond with empathy. Libraries like Sentiment or AFINN can be integrated into a JavaScript agent framework.\n* **Interactive Agent Evaluation:** Build web tools to evaluate agent performance on both task completion and interactional quality.  Use transcripts of agent-user dialogues to assess meta-cognitive and meta-emotional aspects of the interaction, such as prompt refinement and emotional responsiveness. This could be facilitated by a custom-built JavaScript interface that displays interaction transcripts and allows annotators to mark relevant aspects.\n\n**4. Example Code Snippet (Conceptual):**\n\nThis example illustrates how to integrate an LLM into a React component for interactive writing:\n\n```javascript\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\nimport { OpenAI } from 'openai'; // Replace with your preferred LLM library\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY' }); // Initialize LLM\n\nfunction InteractiveWriter() {\n  const [text, setText] = useState('');\n  const [suggestion, setSuggestion] = useState('');\n\n  const handleInputChange = async (event) => {\n    const newText = event.target.value;\n    setText(newText);\n\n    const completion = await openai.completions.create({\n      model: \"text-davinci-003\", // Or any other suitable LLM model\n      prompt: `Continue writing this: ${newText}`,\n      max_tokens: 50, // Adjust as needed\n    });\n\n    setSuggestion(completion.choices[0].text);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <textarea value={text} onChange={handleInputChange} />\n      <p>Suggestion: {suggestion}</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default InteractiveWriter;\n\n```\n\nThis is a basic example; you would need to adapt it based on the specific requirements of your project.\n\nBy focusing on interactional design, prompt engineering, and meta-cognitive awareness, JavaScript developers can build innovative and engaging LLM-based multi-agent web applications that go beyond simple automation and embrace the potential for true human-AI collaboration.  This approach will be essential for leveraging the full potential of LLMs in the evolving landscape of web development.",
