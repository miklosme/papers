  "title": "Order Fairness Evaluation of DAG-based ledgers",
  "abstract": "Order fairness in distributed ledgers refers to properties that relate the order in which transactions are sent or received to the order in which they are eventually finalized, i.e., totally ordered. The study of such properties is relatively new and has been especially stimulated by the rise of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) attacks in blockchain environments. Unlike blockchains, DAG-based ledgers allow participants in the network to independently propose blocks, which are then arranged as vertices of a directed acyclic graph. In this paper, we aim to quantify the capability of DAG-based ledgers to achieve order fairness. To this end, we define new variants of order fairness adapted to DAG-based ledgers and evaluate the impact of an adversary capable of compromising a limited number of nodes (below the one-third threshold) to reorder transactions. Our study shows that DAG-based ledgers are still vulnerable to reordering attacks, as an adversary can coordinate a minority of Byzantine nodes to manipulate the DAG's structure.",
  "summary": "This paper studies fairness in transaction ordering within DAG-based distributed ledgers, particularly DagRider.  It investigates how malicious actors can manipulate transaction order, impacting application-layer fairness. Results show DagRider, while more robust than some blockchains, remains vulnerable.  The choice of deterministic ordering algorithm within DagRider significantly impacts its vulnerability.\n\nKey takeaways for LLM-based multi-agent systems:\n\n*   Transaction order manipulation is a security concern in multi-agent systems relying on distributed ledgers.\n*   The specific algorithm for achieving consensus affects system vulnerability to manipulation.\n*   Byzantine actors coordinating actions can exploit vulnerabilities, even without controlling the majority.\n*   Focusing on DAGs in such a setting is especially relevant for multi-agent simulations in asynchronous settings where scaling is important, which LLMs require, and the algorithms studied in the paper provide specific approaches for handling transaction ordering with concrete algorithms, which is of interest for multi-agent applications.\n*   The deterministic ordering algorithm used within the consensus mechanism has a strong effect on fairness and resilience.\n*   This study has implications for fair resource allocation and reliable communication in LLM-based multi-agent environments.\n*   The fairness attacks presented in this paper demonstrate the importance of considering fairness attacks when designing LLMs-based agents operating in competitive environments.\n*   The insights on the effects of delays in such asynchronous systems highlight the importance of carefully simulating network latency when testing LLM-based multi-agent systems.",
  "takeaways": "This research paper analyzes the fairness of transaction ordering in DAG-based distributed ledgers, particularly relevant to multi-agent systems where LLMs act as autonomous agents interacting and transacting within a shared environment.  Hereâ€™s how a JavaScript developer can translate these insights into practical LLM-based multi-agent app development:\n\n**1. Understanding Order Fairness Implications:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine a decentralized marketplace built with LLMs. Agents negotiate trades, submit bids, and finalize transactions.  Unfair order manipulation could allow malicious agents to front-run legitimate bids or manipulate market prices.\n* **Application:** JavaScript developers must prioritize implementing fair ordering mechanisms within their application logic. This involves designing transaction submission and processing queues that adhere to fairness properties like those discussed in the paper (receive-order fairness, send-order fairness, etc.).\n\n**2. Simulating Network Conditions with JavaScript:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Test the robustness of your LLM-based multi-agent application under various network conditions.  The paper emphasizes how network latency and Byzantine node behavior can impact fairness.\n* **Application:**  Use JavaScript libraries like `mockttp` or `nock` to simulate network delays, dropped packets, and Byzantine behavior. This allows you to test how your agents and transaction ordering mechanisms perform under adverse conditions and identify potential vulnerabilities.\n\n**3. Implementing DagRider Concepts with JavaScript:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Explore using DAG-based structures to manage agent interactions and transactions.  The paper focuses on DagRider as a case study.\n* **Application:** JavaScript libraries for graph data structures, like `vis-network` or `cytoscape.js`, can be used to represent and manipulate the DAG. Developers can implement core DagRider concepts, like vertex proposal, reliable broadcast, and wave finalization, using JavaScript.  This allows for experimentation with different deterministic ordering mechanisms within the DAG structure.\n\n**4. Building a Reliable Broadcast Layer in JavaScript:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Ensure consistent message delivery between agents, crucial for transaction ordering and overall system integrity. The paper discusses Bracha's Byzantine Reliable Broadcast.\n* **Application:**  Implement a simplified version of Bracha's algorithm in JavaScript using libraries like `socket.io` or `peerjs` for peer-to-peer communication.  This involves managing ECHO and READY messages, handling Byzantine node behavior, and ensuring agreement on delivered messages.\n\n**5. Implementing Fair Ordering Queues in JavaScript:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Design agent interaction queues that prioritize fair ordering of transactions and requests.\n* **Application:** Utilize JavaScript's asynchronous capabilities (Promises, Async/Await) and data structures (priority queues) to manage agent requests and ensure they are processed according to specified fairness properties.  This might involve timestamps, priority levels, or other mechanisms to enforce fair ordering.\n\n\n**6. Monitoring Fairness Metrics:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  Track and analyze fairness metrics within your LLM-based multi-agent application.\n* **Application:** Integrate monitoring tools and log analysis in JavaScript to track metrics like transaction latency, order violations, and client fairness scores.  This allows you to identify trends, detect potential manipulation, and evaluate the effectiveness of fairness mechanisms.\n\n**Example Code Snippet (Conceptual):**\n\n```javascript\n// Simplified representation of a transaction processing queue\nclass FairQueue {\n  constructor(orderingMechanism) {\n    this.queue = [];\n    this.orderingMechanism = orderingMechanism; // e.g., \"receive-order\"\n  }\n\n  enqueue(transaction) {\n    transaction.timestamp = Date.now(); // Add timestamp for ordering\n    this.queue.push(transaction);\n    this.sortQueue();\n  }\n\n  sortQueue() {\n    if (this.orderingMechanism === \"receive-order\") {\n      this.queue.sort((a, b) => a.timestamp - b.timestamp);\n    } // Implement other mechanisms similarly\n  }\n\n  // ... other queue operations ...\n}\n```\n\nBy understanding and applying the principles of order fairness from this research, JavaScript developers can build more robust, secure, and fair LLM-based multi-agent applications for the web.  This research encourages experimentation and provides valuable insights for building next-generation decentralized systems.",
