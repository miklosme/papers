  "title": "Networked Agents in the Dark: Team Value Learning under Partial Observability",
  "abstract": "We propose a novel cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach for networked agents. In contrast to previous methods that rely on complete state information or joint observations, our agents must learn how to reach shared objectives under partial observability. During training, they collect individual rewards and approximate a team value function through local communication, resulting in cooperative behavior. To describe our problem, we introduce the networked dynamic partially observable Markov game framework, where agents communicate over a switching topology communication network. Our distributed method, DNA-MARL, uses a consensus mechanism for local communication and gradient descent for local computation. DNA-MARL increases the range of the possible applications of networked agents, being well-suited for real-world domains that impose privacy and where the messages may not reach their recipients. We evaluate DNA-MARL across benchmark MARL scenarios. Our results highlight the superior performance of DNA-MARL over previous methods.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces DNA-MARL, a novel approach for training cooperative multi-agent systems in scenarios where agents have limited or \"partial\" views of the overall situation.  Instead of relying on a central controller or full information sharing, agents communicate locally to build a shared understanding of the team's goals and learn how to best contribute to them.\n\nKey points for LLM-based multi-agent systems:  DNA-MARL facilitates decentralized training and execution, addressing the practical challenges of building large-scale multi-agent systems. Its consensus mechanism for shared understanding is particularly relevant to LLM agents, offering a potential way for them to align their actions without direct access to each other's internal states or requiring excessive communication. This is particularly relevant for privacy-preserving scenarios where sharing full observations might not be feasible. The flexible degree of cooperation offered by DNA-MARL allows controlling the trade-off between individual and collective behavior in LLM-based agents.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents DNA-MARL, a decentralized training approach for multi-agent reinforcement learning under partial observability.  Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply its insights to LLM-based multi-agent web applications:\n\n**Scenario:** Imagine building a collaborative writing web app where multiple LLMs (agents) co-author a document. Each LLM has its own \"view\" of the document (partial observability), focusing on different sections or aspects like style, grammar, or content.  They need to cooperate to create a cohesive final product.\n\n**Applying DNA-MARL Principles:**\n\n1. **Decentralized Communication & Consensus:**  Instead of a central server coordinating all LLMs, leverage peer-to-peer communication libraries like WebRTC or Socket.IO.  After each LLM generates text (an \"action\"), they share their individual \"value\" assessments (e.g., a score representing the quality of their contribution) with their peers. Implement a consensus mechanism in JavaScript, similar to the paper's averaging approach, to reach agreement on a team value. This could be a simple average of the individual values, weighted by factors like confidence scores.\n\n```javascript\n// Simplified consensus function\nfunction consensus(agentValues) {\n  const sum = agentValues.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0);\n  return sum / agentValues.length;\n}\n```\n\n2. **Local LLM Updates:** Each LLM uses its local view and the agreed-upon team value to update its own policy (how it generates text).  This update can be implemented using a JavaScript library for gradient-based optimization like TensorFlow.js.  The team value acts as a global signal informing each LLM about the overall quality of the document.\n\n```javascript\n// Simplified LLM update using TensorFlow.js\nasync function updateLLMPolicy(teamValue, localObservations) {\n  // ... define loss function based on teamValue and localObservations\n  const loss = tf.mean(tf.square(teamValue - predictedValue));\n  // ... use an optimizer to update LLM parameters\n  optimizer.minimize(() => loss);\n}\n```\n\n3. **Partial Observability Representation:** Represent the LLMs' partial views in JavaScript objects. These could be subsets of the document, specific metrics, or even embeddings generated from the text they focus on.\n\n```javascript\n// Example partial observation for an LLM\nconst partialObservation = {\n  textSegment: \"The quick brown fox jumps...\",\n  grammarScore: 0.9,\n  styleScore: 0.8\n};\n```\n\n4. **Asynchronous Updates:** In a real-time collaborative writing app, LLMs might update their text asynchronously.  Adapt DNA-MARL to handle this by using asynchronous communication and updating the team value as new contributions arrive.\n\n**JavaScript Frameworks & Libraries:**\n\n* **TensorFlow.js/Brain.js:** For implementing and training the LLMs.\n* **WebRTC/Socket.IO:** For peer-to-peer communication between LLMs.\n* **React/Vue.js:** For building the user interface and managing the document state.\n\n**Key Advantages of this Approach:**\n\n* **Scalability:** Decentralized communication reduces the load on a central server.\n* **Privacy:** LLMs don't need to share their entire view of the document, preserving privacy.\n* **Robustness:** The system is more resilient to individual LLM failures.\n\n**Further Experimentation:**\n\n* Explore different consensus mechanisms (weighted averaging, median, etc.).\n* Investigate more sophisticated reward functions that capture various aspects of writing quality.\n* Experiment with different LLM architectures and fine-tuning strategies.\n\nBy adapting the core concepts of DNA-MARL and leveraging existing JavaScript tools, developers can build sophisticated collaborative web applications powered by multiple LLMs that learn to cooperate effectively under partial observability. This example focused on collaborative writing, but the approach is applicable to various multi-agent web development scenarios, such as collaborative design, online gaming, and decentralized marketplaces.",

It extends the standard actor-critic algorithm by incorporating a \"consensus\" mechanism, which enables agents to share information about their value estimations (team-V) and parameters.  This promotes cooperation even when agents have limited information about the overall state.  Key steps:\n\n1. **Initialization:**  Each agent starts with independent actor and critic networks.  The critic networks are initially synchronized by averaging their parameters.\n\n2. **Interaction with Environment:** Agents interact with the environment, collecting trajectories (sequences of observations, actions, and rewards).\n\n3. **Team-V Consensus:** Agents calculate a local team-V (value estimation), then iteratively refine this estimation by averaging their values with neighbors on a communication graph. This helps them converge towards a shared understanding of the value function despite partial observability.\n\n4. **Local Updates:** Agents update their individual actor and critic parameters based on their local trajectories and the consensual team-V estimation.\n\n5. **Parameter Consensus:** Periodically, agents synchronize their actor and critic network parameters through a similar consensus procedure.  This improves sample efficiency by preventing agents from diverging too much in their policy learning.\n\n\n**Algorithm 2: DNAQL (Double Networked Averaging Q-Learner)**\n\nThis is a Q-learning variant of the above algorithm.  It replaces the actor-critic architecture with a single Q-network. The key differences are:\n\n1. **Learning Target:** Instead of using the advantage function as in DNAA2C, DNAQL uses a target Q-value, which is calculated as the immediate reward plus the discounted maximum Q-value achievable from the next state.\n\n2. **Consensus:** Consensus is performed on the Q-values and the Q-network's parameters. The overall structure remains largely the same, emphasizing cooperation and information sharing through consensus in a partially observable setting.",
