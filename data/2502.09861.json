  "title": "A Scoresheet for Explainable AI",
  "abstract": "Explainability is important for the transparency of autonomous and intelligent systems and for helping to support the development of appropriate levels of trust. There has been considerable work on developing approaches for explaining systems and there are standards that specify requirements for transparency. However, there is a gap: the standards are too high-level and do not adequately specify requirements for explainability. This paper develops a scoresheet that can be used to specify explainability requirements or to assess the explainability aspects provided for particular applications. The scoresheet is developed by considering the requirements of a range of stakeholders and is applicable to Multiagent Systems as well as other AI technologies. We also provide guidance for how to use the scoresheet and illustrate its generality and usefulness by applying it to a range of applications.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces a \"scoresheet\" for evaluating the explainability of AI systems, including multi-agent systems.  It aims to bridge the gap between high-level standards for AI transparency and the practical need for concrete assessment methods.\n\nKey points for LLM-based multi-agent systems:\n\n* **Veracity:**  Explanations must be reliable and reflect the system's actual reasoning, which is challenging with LLMs prone to \"hallucinations.\"  Directly deriving explanations from the system's internal workings or logs is preferred over using proxy models.\n* **Global vs. Local Explanations:**  Global explanations describe the system's overall functionality (how and how well it works), while local explanations pertain to specific decisions. Both are crucial for understanding multi-agent system behavior.\n* **Explanation Concepts:** Using concepts like beliefs, goals, and preferences in explanations, mirroring human reasoning, can improve their understandability. This aligns with the tendency of LLMs to generate explanations using these concepts.\n* **Explanation Types:** The scoresheet considers various explanation types based on questions the system can answer (e.g., factual, \"why,\" \"why not,\" hypothetical). This is relevant for designing interactive interfaces for querying LLM-based agents.\n* **Automation:** Ideally, explanations should be automatically generated. The level of automation is a key factor in practical XAI. This is particularly important for multi-agent systems with complex interactions.\n* **Customization and Interactivity:**  Tailoring explanations to individual users and providing interactive exploration of explanations can enhance understanding, which can be facilitated by LLMs' natural language capabilities.\n* **Stakeholder Needs:**  Understanding the needs of various stakeholders is essential for designing effective explanations. LLMs can potentially be used to adapt explanations to different stakeholders' requirements.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents a scoresheet for evaluating the explainability of AI systems, a crucial aspect for building trust and understanding in multi-agent applications. Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights to LLM-based multi-agent projects, focusing on web development scenarios:\n\n**1. Building Explainable Chatbots/Virtual Assistants:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  A multi-agent system where one agent uses an LLM to handle user interaction (like ChatGPT) and other agents manage specific tasks (booking flights, ordering food, etc.).\n* **Application of Scoresheet:** The scoresheet highlights the need for both *global* (how the system works overall) and *local* (why a specific action was taken) explanations.  For the LLM-based agent, the developer can implement logging of prompts, responses, and agent decisions to support local explanations.  For global explanations, a developer could create an interactive guide (using a library like Intro.js) explaining the different agents and their roles. The scoresheet also emphasizes *veracity*. Since LLMs can hallucinate, cross-referencing LLM outputs with knowledge bases or external APIs would improve reliability and be documented for veracity purposes.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** Node.js for backend, React/Vue for frontend.  Store explanation data (prompts, responses, agent actions) in a database like MongoDB.\n\n**2. Collaborative Design Tools with LLMs:**\n\n* **Scenario:** A Figma/Miro-like tool where multiple users (agents) collaborate on a design, assisted by an LLM agent suggesting design elements, generating code snippets, etc.\n* **Application of Scoresheet:** The scoresheet highlights the importance of *individually customized* explanations. A developer could leverage user profiles to tailor explanations to each user's expertise level. The scoresheet also mentions the usefulness of *examples*.  The LLM agent could provide design suggestions with accompanying examples of similar implementations. The concepts section of the scoresheet suggests using *goals, actions, and preferences* in explanations, meaning that the explanation should explain why the suggestion serves the user's goals, what actions were suggested and why one suggestion was better than the others (preferences).\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**  Frontend using React/Vue, backend using Node.js.  Leverage libraries like TensorFlow.js for any client-side LLM interaction if needed.\n\n**3. Multi-Agent Game Development:**\n\n* **Scenario:** A real-time strategy game where each player controls multiple units (agents) with an LLM-based agent acting as a game master or providing assistance to players.\n* **Application of Scoresheet:**  The scoresheet emphasizes explaining *why not* certain actions were taken, which is particularly relevant in game scenarios.  The LLM agent can explain why a player's requested action was impossible (e.g., \"You cannot build a barracks because you lack sufficient resources\").  The scoresheet also mentions *contrastive* explanations. The LLM could explain \"Why did unit A attack unit B *rather than* unit C?\" based on factors like unit health, strategic importance, etc.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**  Frontend using Phaser or Babylon.js, backend using Node.js with a real-time communication framework like Socket.IO.\n\n**4. E-commerce Recommendation Systems:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  A multi-agent system where agents handle inventory, pricing, and customer service. An LLM-based agent analyzes customer data and provides personalized recommendations.\n* **Application of Scoresheet:**  The *features* section highlights *interactivity*. A developer could create an interface (using a library like React-Interactive) that lets users explore *why* they received specific recommendations. They could “drill down” for more details or alternative suggestions.  The scoresheet's focus on *confidence* and *scope of generalization* is relevant here.  The system could indicate how confident it is in a recommendation and under what conditions it applies.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**  Node.js for backend, React/Vue.js for frontend.\n\n**Key takeaways for the JavaScript developer**:\n\n* **Logging and Data Storage:**  Thorough logging of agent actions, LLM prompts/responses, and decision-making processes is critical for generating explanations.\n* **Explanation Interfaces:**  Design user-friendly interfaces to present explanations effectively. Consider interactivity, customization, and clarity.\n* **Veracity Measures:** Implement methods to assess and improve the reliability of LLM-generated explanations. Consider cross-referencing with external data sources.\n* **Frameworks/Libraries:** Leverage existing JavaScript frameworks and libraries to facilitate development.\n\nBy applying the principles of explainable AI and leveraging the provided scoresheet, JavaScript developers can create more transparent and trustworthy LLM-based multi-agent applications, fostering user trust and promoting wider adoption of these powerful technologies.",
