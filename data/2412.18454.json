  "title": "Multi-Agent Norm Perception and Induction in Distributed Healthcare",
  "abstract": "This paper presents a Multi-Agent Norm Perception and Induction Learning Model aimed at facilitating the integration of autonomous agent systems into distributed healthcare environments through dynamic interaction processes. The nature of the medical norm system and its sharing channels necessitates distinct approaches for Multi-Agent Systems to learn two types of norms. Building on this foundation, the model enables agents to simultaneously learn descriptive norms, which capture collective tendencies, and prescriptive norms, which dictate ideal behaviors. Through parameterized mixed probability density models and practice-enhanced Markov games, the multi-agent system perceives descriptive norms in dynamic interactions and captures emergent prescriptive norms. We conducted experiments using a dataset from a neurological medical center spanning from 2016 to 2020. In the model's descriptive norm-sharing experiment, within small-scale medical communities, each agent's Subjective Individual Norm Perception (SINP) achieved a stable KL divergence of below 0.1 with the Objective Collective Norm (OBJ) after participating in medical practice-sharing activities, indicating that the model can perceive the collective medical norms representing the current best clinical practices in the environment. In medium-scale medical communities, the relationship between the number of agents and the norm convergence times followed different types of heavy-tailed distributions. In large-scale medical communities, the system's convergence rate exhibited fluctuations; however, overall, it decreased linearly as the number of agents increased. The Practice Shannon Diversity Index of the medical community, consisting of 10 neurologists in the dataset, gradually converged over 5 years to a value that better aligns with the real diagnostic practices of the neurological medical center. This indicates that the model, through long-term learning and sharing processes, can progressively reflect the actual diagnostic trends and collective behavioral tendencies within the medical community. In the experiment where multiple agents infer prescriptive norms within a dynamic healthcare environment, the agents effectively learned the key clinical protocols N₁ and N₂ within the norm space H, which also included 30 control norms, without developing high belief in invalid norms. Furthermore, the agents' belief update process was relatively smooth, avoiding any discontinuous stepwise updates.",
  "summary": "This paper proposes a multi-agent model for learning and sharing medical norms (best practices and protocols) in a distributed healthcare setting, mimicking how human doctors learn and adapt.\n\nThe model addresses both *descriptive norms* (what doctors tend to do) and *prescriptive norms* (what doctors should do).  For descriptive norms, agents develop individual perceptions of collective tendencies by sharing information (like diagnostic preferences) and updating their beliefs through a Gaussian Mixture Model. For prescriptive norms (rules), agents use a modified rational inductive logic model, incorporating \"practice verification\" within a Markov game environment to learn and refine their understanding of optimal protocols. The model emphasizes the importance of interaction and continuous learning for aligning individual and collective behaviors, using real-world data to ground the learning process and avoid convergence to unrealistic or ineffective norms. The learning process for prescriptive norms incorporates adaptive learning rates and momentum for more stable and accurate updates, addressing a key challenge in Bayesian rule induction within multi-agent systems.",
  "takeaways": "This paper offers valuable insights for JavaScript developers working on LLM-based multi-agent applications, especially in dynamic environments like collaborative web apps. Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply the concepts:\n\n**1. Modeling Descriptive Norms (MedT - Medical Tendencies):**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine building a collaborative writing platform where multiple users contribute to a document. You want the AI agents to learn the group's writing style (descriptive norm) regarding sentence length, vocabulary complexity, and tone.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * Use a library like TensorFlow.js to implement the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) described in the paper. Each Gaussian in the GMM can represent a distinct writing style cluster.\n    * Train the GMM on existing document data to learn initial \"Objective Collective Norms\" (OBJ).\n    * As users contribute, represent their writing style features as vectors and update the agent's \"Subjective Individual Norm Perception\" (SINP) using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm as described. This allows the agents to dynamically adjust their perception of the collective norm.\n    * Use the KL Divergence (implemented in TensorFlow.js or other math libraries) to measure the difference between SINP and OBJ, tracking how well agents adapt to the group's writing style.\n\n```javascript\n// Simplified example using TensorFlow.js\nconst gmm = tf.layers.dense({ units: numClusters, activation: 'softmax' }).apply(inputFeatures); // GMM output\n// ... training and updating using EM algorithm ...\nconst klDivergence = tf.losses.klDivergence(sinp, obj);\n```\n\n**2. Implementing Prescriptive Norms (Rules):**\n\n* **Scenario:** In a collaborative project management app, certain rules (prescriptive norms) exist: tasks must be assigned to a user, deadlines must be set, and progress must be updated regularly.  LLM agents should learn and enforce these norms.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * Represent prescriptive norms as logical rules using a rule engine library like Nools or json-rules-engine.\n    * Define a \"norm space\" `H` containing all possible rules (including desired norms and irrelevant control norms), similar to the paper.\n    * Use a Markov Game framework (can be implemented with reinforcement learning libraries like rl.js) to simulate the multi-agent interactions. The Bellman equation described can be used to calculate agent rewards based on compliance with norms.\n    * Employ Bayesian inference to update the agent's belief in each norm.  The paper's smoothing techniques (adaptive learning rates, momentum) are essential here and can be implemented using simple JavaScript functions to update belief values.\n\n```javascript\n// Simplified example using json-rules-engine\nconst ruleEngine = new RuleEngine();\nruleEngine.addRule({\n  conditions: { taskAssigned: { equal: true } }, // Example condition\n  event: { type: 'normComplied', params: { norm: 'taskAssignment' } }\n});\n// ... integrate with Markov Game and Bayesian inference ...\n```\n\n**3. Combining LLMs:**\n\nThe above examples illustrate the core mechanics.  LLMs come into play when:\n\n* **Generating Norms:**  Instead of manually defining all prescriptive norms, an LLM can be used to generate a broader set of potential rules from natural language descriptions or examples.\n* **Explaining Norm Violations:** When an agent detects a norm violation, an LLM can generate an explanation for the user, improving transparency and user experience.\n* **Mediating Conflicts:** If multiple agents learn conflicting norms, an LLM can help mediate and resolve these conflicts by proposing compromise solutions or prioritizing norms.\n\n**4. Relevant JavaScript Frameworks/Libraries:**\n\n* **TensorFlow.js:** For GMM implementation, KL Divergence calculation.\n* **rl.js, EasyRL:**  For reinforcement learning and Markov Game implementation.\n* **Nools, json-rules-engine:** For rule engine implementation.\n* **LangChain, LlamaIndex:** For orchestrating LLM interactions with the multi-agent system.\n\n\nBy adapting the principles from this paper and using these readily available JavaScript tools, developers can create more sophisticated, adaptive, and norm-aware LLM-based multi-agent web applications. This enables the development of more robust and effective systems capable of operating within a predefined set of rules, learning from collective behavior, and adapting to the evolving dynamics of a collaborative environment.",

They utilize a helper function `gaussian(x, mean, stdDev)` to compute the Gaussian probability density function.\n\n2. **`emAlgorithm(data, weights, means, variances, numIterations)`:** This function implements the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to iteratively re-estimate the parameters of the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) used for norm perception. It uses helper functions `calculatePosteriorProbabilities`, `updateWeights`, `updateMeans`, and `updateVariances`, to perform the E-step and M-step of the algorithm.  This allows agents to learn the OBJ distribution from observed data.\n\n3. **`calculateKLDivergence(pSinp, pObj)`:** This function calculates the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the SINP and OBJ distributions, which measures how well an agent's subjective norm perception matches the objective collective norm, as per equation (10).\n\n4. **`updateNormBelief(belief, regulationFactor)`:** This function implements the belief update rule with the regulation factor, as described in equation (18). This adjusts the agent's belief based on the observed effectiveness of the norm in practice.\n\n\n5. **`updateLearningRateAndMomentum(norm, learningRate, momentum, beta1, beta2, gradient)`:** This function updates the learning rate and momentum used in the belief update process for prescriptive norms, utilizing equations (B.21) to (B.23). This improves the stability and efficiency of the learning process.\n\n\nThese JavaScript functions provide a practical implementation of the core algorithms described in the paper, enabling JavaScript developers to experiment with multi-agent norm perception and induction in their own applications.  Note that some of the helper functions of the EM algorithm have been left with minimal implementation comments, as their full implementation requires greater details that are omitted from the source paper.  Adjust as necessary according to the specifics of your use-case and data.",
