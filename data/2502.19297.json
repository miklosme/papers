  "title": "Combining Planning and Reinforcement Learning for Solving Relational Multiagent Domains",
  "abstract": "Multiagent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) poses significant challenges due to the exponential growth of state and action spaces and the non-stationary nature of multiagent environments. This results in notable sample inefficiency and hinders generalization across diverse tasks. The complexity is further pronounced in relational settings, where domain knowledge is crucial but often underutilized by existing MARL algorithms. To overcome these hurdles, we propose integrating relational planners as centralized controllers with efficient state abstractions and reinforcement learning. This approach proves to be sample-efficient and facilitates effective task transfer and generalization.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces MaRePReL, a novel framework combining relational and hierarchical planning with reinforcement learning to enable multiple AI agents to solve complex tasks in environments with varying numbers of objects and relations.  It addresses challenges in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), such as the exponential growth of state/action spaces and non-stationarity, by using a relational planner as a centralized controller to decompose tasks and assign sub-tasks to agents.  An abstraction mechanism then simplifies the state space for efficient learning by individual deep RL agents.  Experiments show that MaRePReL improves sample efficiency, facilitates transfer learning, and generalizes to varying numbers of objects compared to traditional MARL baselines.\n\nKey points for LLM-based multi-agent systems:\n\n* **Centralized planning and task decomposition:**  A hierarchical planner can leverage the reasoning capabilities of LLMs to decompose complex goals into manageable sub-tasks.\n* **Abstraction for efficient RL:** LLMs could be used to automate the state abstraction process, dynamically identifying the relevant information for each agent's sub-task.\n* **Relational representation:** LLMs can readily handle relational data and reason about relationships between objects, making them well-suited for representing complex environments for multi-agent systems.\n* **Potential for improved generalization and transfer:** Combining LLM-based planning with RL could lead to more robust and adaptable multi-agent systems.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents MaRePReL, a framework combining relational planning, reinforcement learning, and a task distributor for multi-agent systems in complex environments. Hereâ€™s how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights to LLM-based multi-agent web applications:\n\n**1. Hierarchical Task Decomposition with LLMs:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine building a multi-agent system for managing a complex e-commerce website. Agents handle tasks like inventory management, customer support, and order fulfillment.\n* **Application:** Use an LLM as the relational hierarchical planner. The LLM takes the overall goal (e.g., \"process a customer order\") and decomposes it into sub-tasks (e.g., \"check inventory,\" \"allocate items,\" \"generate shipping label\").  The LLM can leverage product catalogs, customer data, and logistics information to create a plan. The output can be a JSON structure representing the task hierarchy.\n\n```javascript\n// Example JSON output from the LLM planner\n{\n  \"goal\": \"process_customer_order\",\n  \"subtasks\": [\n    {\"task\": \"check_inventory\", \"item\": \"product_A\", \"quantity\": 2},\n    {\"task\": \"allocate_items\", \"warehouse\": \"warehouse_1\"},\n    {\"task\": \"generate_shipping_label\", \"address\": \"...\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**2. Task Distribution with JavaScript:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  Distribute the sub-tasks generated by the LLM among specialized agents.\n* **Application:** Implement a task distributor in JavaScript. This module analyzes the LLM's JSON output and assigns sub-tasks to agents based on their capabilities and current workload.  You could use libraries like `cluster` (for Node.js) or web workers to manage agent processes.\n\n```javascript\n// Example task distributor logic\nfunction distributeTasks(tasks, agents) {\n  for (const task of tasks.subtasks) {\n    const agent = findBestAgent(task, agents); // Logic to select the appropriate agent\n    agent.postMessage(task); // Send the task to the agent\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**3. LLM-based State Abstraction:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Simplify complex website states for individual agents.\n* **Application:** Use the LLM as the abstraction reasoner. Feed the LLM relevant parts of the website's state (e.g., product details for an inventory agent, customer chat history for a support agent). The LLM can summarize and filter information, providing each agent with a concise, task-relevant abstract state.\n\n```javascript\n// Example prompt to the LLM for state abstraction\nconst prompt = `Summarize the following customer chat history for a support agent \nhandling a refund request: ${chatHistory}`;\nconst abstractState = await llm.generate(prompt);\n```\n\n**4. Reinforcement Learning with JavaScript Libraries:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Train individual agents to perform their specialized tasks efficiently.\n* **Application:** Use JavaScript reinforcement learning libraries like `ml5.js` or `brain.js` to train agent behavior.  The agents learn by interacting with their abstract environment (provided by the LLM) and receiving rewards based on their performance.\n\n\n**5. Web Development Integration:**\n\n* **Frameworks:** Integrate these components into a web application using frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular. Use message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) or WebSockets for communication between the LLM, the task distributor, and the agents.\n* **Visualization:** Use JavaScript libraries like D3.js or Chart.js to visualize agent performance and system behavior.\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n\n* **LLM Choice:** Select an LLM suitable for planning, reasoning, and summarization (e.g., GPT-3, PaLM).\n* **Scalability:** Design the system with scalability in mind, anticipating increased traffic and data volume.\n* **Security:** Implement security measures to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access.\n\n\n\nBy following these steps, JavaScript developers can build sophisticated LLM-based multi-agent web applications that efficiently handle complex tasks, adapt to changing environments, and personalize user experiences. This powerful combination unlocks new possibilities for building innovative and intelligent web applications.",

The core idea is to use a relational planner to decompose high-level tasks into smaller sub-tasks, which are then assigned to individual agents. Each agent learns a policy for its assigned sub-tasks using deep reinforcement learning.  The algorithm iteratively refines these policies through interaction with the environment.  A key component is the abstraction reasoner (using D-FOCI statements), which simplifies the state space for each agent, making learning more efficient. If a plan becomes invalid during execution (e.g., due to unexpected changes in the environment), the algorithm re-plans.\n\n\n```javascript\n// Algorithm 2: GetAgentActions\n\nfunction getAgentActions(s, agentTasks, pi, F, A) {\n  let actions = {}; // Initialize an empty dictionary to store agent actions\n\n  for (const agentId in agentTasks) { // Loop through all agents\n\n    if (agentTasks[agentId].currentTask) { // Check if agent has a current task\n\n      let o = agentTasks[agentId].currentTask.operator;\n      let policy = pi[o]; // Retrieve the agent's policy\n      let abstractState = getAbstractState(s, o, F); // Generate the agent's abstract state\n\n      if (!isTerminal(abstractState, o)) { // If the current state is not terminal\n        actions[agentId] = policy(abstractState); // Get next action using the policy for abstract state\n\n      }\n    }\n\n  }\n\n  return actions; // Return the dictionary of agent actions\n}\n```\n**Explanation of GetAgentActions:**\n\nThis function determines the actions each agent should take in the current state. It iterates through each agent, retrieves the appropriate policy based on the agent's current task, and uses this policy to select an action.  Crucially, it uses the abstracted state, which is a simplified representation of the environment relevant to the agent's current sub-task.\n\n\n```javascript\n// Algorithm 3: reprelStep\n\nasync function reprelStep(s, actions, D, tr, agentTasks, plan, F, A) {\n\n  let { nextState, rewards } = await environmentStep(s, actions);\n  let planValid = true;\n\n  for (const agentId in agentTasks) {\n\n    if (agentTasks[agentId].currentTask) {\n\n      let o = agentTasks[agentId].currentTask.operator;\n\n      let abstractS = getAbstractState(s, o, F);\n      let abstractNextS = getAbstractState(nextState, o, F);\n\n      let wasTerminal = isTerminal(abstractS, o);\n      let preConditionMet = satisfiesPrecondition(abstractS, o);\n      let isTerminal = isTerminal(abstractNextS, o);\n\n      if (isTerminal) {\n        rewards[agentId] += tr; // Add terminal reward\n\n      }\n\n      D[o].push({ state: abstractS, action: actions[agentId], reward: rewards[agentId], nextState: abstractNextS}); // Add experience to the buffer\n\n      if (!wasTerminal && !preConditionMet) {\n        planValid = false; // If precondition not met, set planInvalid flag to true\n      }\n\n    }\n\n\n  }\n\n\n  return { nextState, updatedBuffers: D, rewards, planValid };\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of reprelStep:**\n\nThis function executes a single step of the environment simulation. It takes the current state, actions for each agent, and other relevant information as input. It then updates the environment state, calculates rewards, stores the experience in the replay buffer, and checks if the current plan is still valid. It also updates the agent tasks if conditions are met or flags if the plan needs to be recomputed.  The use of abstracted states (abstractS, abstractNextS) is crucial for efficient learning.\n\n\nThese JavaScript implementations provide a clearer structure and allow for more straightforward integration into JavaScript-based projects. Remember that the provided `// Helper Functions` are placeholders and must be implemented based on your specific environment and task definitions.  Also, consider using asynchronous operations (e.g., using `async` and `await`) when interacting with the environment or performing potentially time-consuming computations.",
