  "title": "Asynchronous Multi-Agent Systems with Petri nets",
  "abstract": "Abstract. Modeling the interaction between components is crucial for many applications and serves as a fundamental step in analyzing and verifying properties in multi-agent systems. In this paper, we propose a method based on 1-safe Petri nets to model Asynchronous Multi-Agent Systems (AMAS), starting from two semantics defined on AMAS represented as transition systems. Specifically, we focus on two types of synchronization: synchronization on transitions and synchronization on data. For both, we define an operator that composes 1-safe Petri nets and demonstrate the relationships between the composed Petri net and the global transition systems as defined in the literature. Additionally, we analyze the relationships between the two semantics on Petri nets, proposing two constructions that enable switching between them. These transformations are particularly useful for system analysis, as they allow the selection of the most suitable model based on the property that needs to be verified.",
  "summary": "This paper explores modeling asynchronous multi-agent systems using Petri nets, offering two approaches: synchronization on transitions (shared actions) and synchronization on data (read-only access to other agents' states).  It provides methods to translate between these two representations and demonstrates how Petri nets can offer a more compact representation than transition systems, especially when dealing with multiple agents sharing the same actions. This is particularly relevant to LLM-based multi-agent systems where agents might collaborate on similar tasks or communicate using shared vocabulary, leading to a more manageable and efficient system representation. The ability to switch between transition-based and data-based synchronization offers flexibility for different design and implementation needs in complex LLM-based multi-agent applications.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents a valuable theoretical foundation for modeling asynchronous multi-agent systems using Petri nets, which can be highly relevant for LLM-based multi-agent app development in JavaScript. Let's explore how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights:\n\n**1. Modeling Agent Interactions:**\n\n* **Visualizing with Petri Nets:** Use libraries like `petri-net.js` or `jsplumb` to visually represent the flow of information and actions between agents in your web application. This visualization can help in understanding complex interactions and identifying potential bottlenecks or deadlocks.\n* **State Management:**  Petri nets' concept of places (representing states) can inform state management in your frontend application (e.g., using React, Vue, or Svelte). Each agent's state can be represented as a set of active places in its Petri net, providing a structured and clear way to manage complex agent states.\n* **Event Handling:** Petri nets' transitions (representing actions or events) can be mapped to event listeners and handlers in your JavaScript code.  The enabling and firing of transitions can trigger corresponding actions within your web application. For example, an LLM agent receiving a user query (a transition firing) could trigger a request to an external API or update the UI.\n\n**2. Synchronization Strategies:**\n\n* **Synchronization on Transitions (Shared Actions):**  Implement this by creating shared event emitters or message queues using libraries like `socket.io` or `mqtt.js`. Agents subscribe to these shared events and react accordingly, ensuring synchronized actions. This approach is suitable for scenarios requiring strict coordination, such as collaborative editing or real-time gaming.  In a collaborative document editing scenario, when one agent updates the document, a \"documentUpdated\" event is emitted, and other agents synchronize their local copies accordingly.\n* **Synchronization on Data (Read-Only Access):**  Use a shared data store (e.g., a Redux store, a shared object in Node.js, or a distributed database) where agents can read the state of other agents without direct modification.  This is useful for scenarios where agents need to be aware of each other's state for decision-making but don't require strict synchronization of actions, like personalized recommendations in an e-commerce application based on the browsing history of other similar users (agents).\n\n**3. Asynchronous Communication:**\n\n* **Promises and Async/Await:**  Leverage JavaScript's async/await capabilities and Promises to model the asynchronous nature of agent actions. This ensures that your web application remains responsive while agents perform potentially time-consuming tasks, such as interacting with LLMs or external services.\n* **Web Workers:** For complex agent logic that might block the main thread, use Web Workers to create separate threads for agent processing, maintaining a smooth user experience.\n\n**4. Agent Development with LLMs:**\n\n* **LangChain:** Frameworks like LangChain offer tools to build LLM-powered agents. You can integrate Petri net-based modeling into your LangChain agent development workflow.  For instance, you can use a Petri net to represent the flow of a conversation between a user and an LLM agent, with places representing conversation states and transitions representing user input or LLM responses.\n* **LLM as Agent Logic:** Use LLMs to define the behavior of your agents by prompting them with descriptions of the Petri net structure and the desired actions associated with transitions. The LLM can generate JavaScript code or instructions that implement the agent's logic based on the Petri net model.\n\n**5. Practical Example: Collaborative Task Management:**\n\nImagine a collaborative task management web application. Each user is an agent, and tasks are represented as tokens moving through the Petri net. Places could represent task states (e.g., \"To Do,\" \"In Progress,\" \"Completed\"), and transitions could represent actions like \"Start Task,\" \"Assign Task,\" or \"Complete Task.\"  Synchronization on transitions ensures that only one agent can work on a task at a time, while synchronization on data allows agents to see the status of all tasks.\n\nBy incorporating these principles and using relevant JavaScript tools, developers can create robust, scalable, and understandable LLM-based multi-agent applications.  This paper's theoretical insights provide a strong foundation for practical application in web development, facilitating the development of more sophisticated and complex multi-agent systems.",
