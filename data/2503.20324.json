  "title": "CTS-CBS: A New Approach for Multi-Agent Collaborative Task Sequencing and Path Finding",
  "abstract": "Abstract-This paper addresses a generalization problem of Multi-Agent Pathfinding (MAPF), called Collaborative Task Sequencing - Multi-Agent Pathfinding (CTS-MAPF), where agents must plan collision-free paths and visit a series of intermediate task locations in a specific order before reaching their final destinations. To address this problem, we propose a new approach, Collaborative Task Sequencing - Conflict-Based Search (CTS-CBS), which conducts a two-level search. In the high level, it generates a search forest, where each tree corresponds to a joint task sequence derived from the jTSP solution. In the low level, CTS-CBS performs constrained single-agent path planning to generate paths for each agent while adhering to high-level constraints. We also provide theoretical guarantees of its completeness and optimality (or sub-optimality with a bounded parameter). To evaluate the performance of CTS-CBS, we create two datasets, CTS-MAPF and MG-MAPF, and conduct comprehensive experiments. The results show that CTS-CBS adaptations for MG-MAPF outperform baseline algorithms in terms of success rate (up to 20 times larger) and runtime (up to 100 times faster), with less than a 10% sacrifice in solution quality. Furthermore, CTS-CBS offers flexibility by allowing users to adjust the sub-optimality bound w to balance between solution quality and efficiency. Finally, practical robot tests demonstrate the algorithm's applicability in real-world scenarios.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces CTS-MAPF, a multi-agent pathfinding problem where agents must complete a series of tasks in order before reaching their destinations, like a multi-stop delivery route for multiple robots.  The proposed solution, CTS-CBS, combines task sequencing (like figuring out the best order of deliveries) with collision-free path planning (making sure the robots don't crash).  Key for LLM-based multi-agent systems: the hierarchical approach of CTS-CBS could be adapted to manage complex multi-agent interactions, with a high level handling task delegation and sequencing (potentially leveraging LLMs for decision-making) and a low level focusing on individual agent actions, ensuring coherence and efficiency. The concept of K-best solutions for task sequencing is also relevant, allowing exploration of alternative strategies, potentially enhancing the robustness of LLM-driven multi-agent systems.",
  "takeaways": "This paper's CTS-CBS algorithm, though presented in a robotics context, offers valuable insights for JavaScript developers building LLM-based multi-agent applications for the web.  Here are some practical examples and how they connect to JavaScript development:\n\n**1. Collaborative Content Creation:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine a multi-user web application for collaborative story writing.  Each user (agent) acts as a character with a specific \"story arc\" (tasks to complete) contributing to the overall narrative. CTS-CBS can help orchestrate the flow of writing, ensuring consistency and avoiding narrative collisions.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * **LLMs:** Use LLMs to generate story snippets based on user prompts and constraints derived from the task sequence.\n    * **Agents:**  Represent each user as an agent object in JavaScript.\n    * **Task Sequencing:**  Adapt the K-best Joint Task Sequencing from the paper.  This could involve evaluating different narrative orderings based on coherence and user preferences. You could implement this with a priority queue data structure.\n    * **Conflict Resolution:** Implement a simplified version of the conflict-based search. When two characters' story arcs intersect (e.g., they both want to influence the same event), use the LLM to negotiate a compromise or suggest alternative plot points.  Log conflicts and resolutions in a central data store for analysis and debugging.\n    * **Framework:**  Consider a framework like React to manage the UI updates and communication between agents.  Use a library like LangChain to integrate with different LLMs and manage prompts.\n\n**2. Multi-Agent Customer Service Chatbots:**\n\n* **Scenario:** A website uses multiple specialized chatbots (agents) to handle different customer queries (tasks).  One chatbot handles billing, another shipping, and so on.  CTS-CBS can be used to route customer interactions to the appropriate chatbot in the optimal sequence, minimizing wait times and maximizing customer satisfaction.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * **LLMs:** Each chatbot is powered by an LLM specializing in a particular area.\n    * **Task Assignment:** Based on the customer's initial query, use natural language processing (NLP) to classify the task and assign it to the appropriate agent.\n    * **Task Sequencing:**  If a customer has multiple related questions, use a simplified CTS-CBS to determine the optimal order for addressing them (e.g., address billing inquiries before handling shipping questions).\n    * **Conflict Resolution:** If two chatbots need to access the same customer data simultaneously, implement a locking mechanism or queueing system to avoid conflicts.  Prioritize urgent or high-value tasks.\n    * **Framework:** Node.js with a message queue (like RabbitMQ or Kafka) can be used to manage communication and task distribution between chatbots.\n\n**3. Personalized E-commerce Recommendation Systems:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  An e-commerce site uses multiple recommender agents (e.g., one based on browsing history, another on purchase history, and another on trending items) to suggest products to users.  CTS-CBS can combine these recommendations, presenting them to the user in a personalized and engaging sequence.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * **LLMs:** Employ LLMs to generate product descriptions, reviews, and comparisons.\n    * **Task Sequencing:**  Use CTS-CBS to determine the optimal order for presenting recommendations. Consider factors like product relevance, predicted user interest, and diversity of recommendations.  Implement A* search adaptations for individualized task sequencing.\n    * **Conflict Resolution:**  If two agents recommend the same product, prioritize the agent with the higher confidence score.  Use the LLM to explain the reasons for the recommendations, enhancing user trust.\n    * **Framework:**  Use a frontend framework like React or Vue.js to manage the user interface and display recommendations.  A backend service with Node.js can handle communication with the recommender agents.\n\n**Key JavaScript Considerations:**\n\n* **Asynchronous Programming:** Multi-agent systems are inherently asynchronous.  Use JavaScript's `async`/`await` and Promises to manage concurrent operations.\n* **Data Structures:**  Implement priority queues, graphs, and other data structures necessary for the CTS-CBS algorithm.\n* **Communication:** Use WebSockets or server-sent events for real-time communication between agents and the user interface.\n* **Visualization and Debugging:**  Develop tools to visualize the agent interactions, task sequences, and conflict resolutions.  This will be crucial for understanding and debugging complex multi-agent behavior.\n\n\nBy adapting the core principles of CTS-CBS and leveraging the power of LLMs, JavaScript developers can create innovative and intelligent web applications that are capable of handling complex, multi-faceted user interactions.  The key is to focus on practical adaptations rather than direct implementation of the full algorithm from the research paper.",

It uses a two-level search approach inspired by Conflict-Based Search (CBS).  The high-level search explores different joint task sequences, while the low-level search finds collision-free paths for a given task sequence and set of constraints.\n\n**Purpose:** To find optimal or bounded suboptimal solutions for CTS-MAPF, ensuring that agents complete their assigned tasks while avoiding collisions.\n\n```javascript\n// Algorithm 2: Single Agent K-Best Task Sequencing\n// ... (requires implementation of supporting functions for cost matrix, rTSP solver)\n\n// Algorithm 3: K-Best Joint Task Sequencing\n// ... (requires implementation based on Algorithm 2 and priority queue management)\n\n// Algorithm 4: Necessity Checking for New Search Tree\nfunction check_new_root(P_p, OPEN, w) {\n  let generated_task_sequences = []; // Assuming you track generated task sequences.\n\n  if (OPEN.isEmpty() || P_p.cost > (1 + w) * cost_function(generated_task_sequences[generated_task_sequences.length - 1])) {\n    let R = generated_task_sequences.length;\n    let T_R_plus_1 = k_best_joint_sequencing(R + 1);\n\n    if (T_R_plus_1) {\n      let P_nr = {\n        constraints: new Set(),\n        joint_path: low_level_search(T_R_plus_1, new Set()),\n        cost: cost_function(low_level_search(T_R_plus_1, new Set())),\n      };\n      if (P_p.cost < P_nr.cost) {\n        OPEN.enqueue(P_nr);\n        return P_p;\n      } else {\n        OPEN.enqueue(P_p);\n        return P_nr;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  return P_p;\n\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of Algorithm 4 (Necessity Checking):**\n\nThis function determines when to generate a new search tree in the high-level search of CTS-CBS.  It helps to balance exploration of different task sequences with exploitation within a given sequence.\n\n**Purpose:** To manage the generation of new search trees in a best-first manner, guided by the suboptimality bound `w`.\n\n\n**Key Improvements and Considerations:**\n\n* **Priority Queue:** The JavaScript code explicitly uses a priority queue (which you'll need to implement or import from a library) to manage the OPEN set in CTS-CBS. This ensures efficient retrieval of the node with the lowest cost.\n* **Helper Functions:** The provided JavaScript code relies on placeholder helper functions (e.g., `low_level_search`, `cost_function`, `validate_joint_path`).  You must implement these based on the specifics of your problem, including your graph representation, cost calculation method, and conflict detection logic.\n* **Data Structures:** Consider using appropriate data structures (Sets, Maps, classes) to represent constraints, paths, and other relevant information.\n* **Algorithms 2 and 3:** Algorithms 2 and 3 were omitted because they require further details from the paper and are more involved to implement.  The core idea is to use a combination of restricted TSP solving and partitioning to find K-best task sequences (single-agent and joint).  Refer to the paper for more implementation details on those specific components.\n\n\n\n\nThis revised response gives you a much more complete and functional starting point for implementing CTS-CBS in JavaScript. Remember to replace the placeholder helper functions with your actual implementations.",
