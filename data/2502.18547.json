  "title": "Steganography Beyond Space-Time With Chain of Multimodal AI Agents",
  "abstract": "Abstract-Steganography is the art and science of covert writing, with a broad range of applications interwoven within the realm of cybersecurity. As artificial intelligence continues to evolve, its ability to synthesise realistic content emerges as a threat in the hands of cybercriminals who seek to manipulate and misrepresent the truth. Such synthetic content introduces a non-trivial risk of overwriting the subtle changes made for the purpose of steganography. When the signals in both the spatial and temporal domains are vulnerable to unforeseen overwriting, it calls for reflection on what can remain invariant after all. This study proposes a paradigm in steganography for audiovisual media, where messages are concealed beyond both spatial and temporal domains. A chain of multimodal agents is developed to deconstruct audiovisual content into a cover text, embed a message within the linguistic domain, and then reconstruct the audiovisual content through synchronising both aural and visual modalities with the resultant stego text. The message is encoded by biasing the word sampling process of a language generation model and decoded by analysing the probability distribution of word choices. The accuracy of message transmission is evaluated under both zero-bit and multi-bit capacity settings. Fidelity is assessed through both biometric and semantic similarities, capturing the identities of the recorded face and voice, as well as the core ideas conveyed through the media. Secrecy is examined through statistical comparisons between cover and stego texts. Robustness is tested across various scenarios, including audiovisual compression, face-swapping, voice-cloning and their combinations.",
  "summary": "This paper proposes a steganography method for audiovisual media using a chain of multimodal AI agents. It hides messages within the textual representation of the media, leveraging the orthogonality between linguistic and audiovisual domains.  The message is encoded by biasing the word sampling of a language model during paraphrasing and decoded by analyzing word probabilities.  This approach aims to be robust against manipulations like compression and deepfakes, which could overwrite steganographic changes in the visual or audio signals directly.  The key points relevant to LLM-based multi-agent systems are the use of an LLM as a core component for encoding and decoding hidden information through controlled text generation, and the organization of multiple specialized AI models (speech-to-text, text-to-speech, lip-sync, language model) into a collaborative multi-agent system.",
  "takeaways": "This research paper proposes a novel steganography technique using a chain of multimodal AI agents, which is highly relevant to LLM-powered multi-agent application development in JavaScript. Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights:\n\n**1. Deconstructing and Reconstructing Multimedia Content:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine a collaborative web application where users can share annotated videos.  You want to embed metadata about the annotations (e.g., author, timestamp, keywords) invisibly within the video itself, leveraging the proposed steganographic approach.\n* **Implementation:**  Use JavaScript libraries like WebCodecs API for demultiplexing video and audio streams. For transcription, integrate a JavaScript speech-to-text library like Vosk.js or a cloud-based API like AssemblyAI.  Reconstruction would involve using WebCodecs again for muxing after the stego audio is generated.\n\n**2.  Linguistic Steganography with LLMs:**\n\n* **Scenario:** A secure messaging application where the message content is hidden within seemingly innocuous generated text, like a poem or short story.\n* **Implementation:** Use a JavaScript library like Transformers.js to integrate a pre-trained LLM (e.g., GPT-2, GPT-3, or open-source alternatives). The \"key\" would be a set of keywords used to bias the LLM's word sampling during text generation (as described in the paper).  Decoding involves statistically analyzing the generated text for overrepresentation of the keywords.  This could be implemented with a custom JavaScript function.\n\n**3. Multi-Agent Orchestration:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  A complex web application involving multiple LLMs specializing in different tasks: one for summarizing articles, another for generating headlines, a third for translating content. You can use steganography to communicate instructions or parameters between these agents.\n* **Implementation:** Libraries like LangChain.js are designed for agent orchestration. You could incorporate the steganographic encoding/decoding logic within the agents' communication channels.  For example, the summarization agent could embed instructions for the translation agent within the generated summary text.\n\n**4. Building Robust Systems:**\n\n* **Scenario:** A fact-checking web app where multimedia evidence is crucial. Steganography can be used to embed a digital signature or watermark, verifying the authenticity of the media.\n* **Implementation:** This builds upon the first point. The embedded message (the signature or watermark) needs to be robust against common media transformations. Leverage the insights about robustness from the paper and experiment with different embedding strategies, considering resilience against compression, format changes, and potentially even adversarial attacks.  Test robustness with JavaScript libraries like Canvas API for image manipulation and Web Audio API for audio processing.\n\n**5.  Experimenting with Zero-bit and Multi-bit Encoding:**\n\n* **Scenario:** A simple web interface for demonstrating the concept.  Users can input text, choose zero-bit or multi-bit encoding, select a key (set of keywords), and see the generated stego text.\n* **Implementation:** This is a straightforward JavaScript project using a text area, buttons, and an LLM integrated via Transformers.js. Display statistics about keyword frequencies to illustrate the encoding process.\n\n**Key JavaScript Libraries and Frameworks:**\n\n* **Transformers.js:** For integrating LLMs in the browser.\n* **LangChain.js:** For building and orchestrating LLM-based agent workflows.\n* **WebCodecs API:** For encoding/decoding and manipulating multimedia streams.\n* **Web Audio API:** For audio processing and analysis.\n* **Canvas API:** For image manipulation and analysis.\n* **Vosk.js/AssemblyAI:** For speech-to-text functionality.\n\nBy combining these libraries and applying the concepts from the paper, JavaScript developers can explore the fascinating possibilities of steganography and multi-agent AI systems, leading to innovative and secure web applications.  Remember that these are just starting points – the paper’s ideas can spark many creative applications in web development.",
  "pseudocode": "The paper contains mathematical formulas and descriptions of processes, but it doesn't contain pseudocode blocks in the traditional sense. The closest things to algorithms are expressed as numbered equations.  Therefore, I will translate those equation-like descriptions into JavaScript functions, along with explanations.\n\n**1. Demultiplexing (Equation 1):**\n\n```javascript\nfunction demux(multimediaContainer) {\n  // In a real application, this would involve parsing the container format\n  // (e.g., MP4, WebM) and extracting the video and audio tracks.  \n  // This is a simplified representation.\n  const videoStream = multimediaContainer.video;\n  const audioStream = multimediaContainer.audio;\n\n  if (!videoStream || !audioStream) {\n    throw new Error(\"Invalid multimedia container.  Missing video or audio.\");\n  }\n  return { video: videoStream, audio: audioStream };\n}\n\n\n// Example usage (assuming 'container' holds the multimedia data):\nconst streams = demux(container); \nconst video = streams.video;\nconst audio = streams.audio; \n```\n\n* **Explanation:**  This function simulates separating a multimedia container into its constituent video and audio streams. In a real-world scenario, this would involve using libraries to handle specific container formats.  The example provided shows how to access the streams using standard JavaScript object notation.  The actual retrieval method for the data depends on how the container data is managed in the web app.\n\n**2. Transcription (Equation 2):**\n\n```javascript\nasync function transcribe(audioStream) {\n  // In a real app, you'd use a speech-to-text library/API like Whisper.\n  // This is a placeholder.\n  try {\n     const transcript = await whisperAPI.transcribe(audioStream);  // Example API call\n     return transcript;\n  } catch (error) {\n      console.error(\"Transcription error:\", error);\n      return null; // Or handle the error as needed\n  }\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nconst text = await transcribe(audio);\n```\n\n* **Explanation:**  This function simulates transcribing audio into text.  It's crucial to replace the placeholder comment with a call to a real speech-to-text API or library (e.g., the Whisper API, Web Speech API, or a server-side transcription service).  The `async` and `await` keywords are used because transcription is typically an asynchronous operation.\n\n**3. Encoding (Equation 3):**\n\n```javascript\nasync function encode(coverText, key) {\n  // Use a language model (e.g., Llama) for paraphrasing.\n  const keywords = selectKeywords(key); // Function to get keywords based on the key\n\n  // Example using a hypothetical LLM API:\n  try {\n      const stegoText = await llmAPI.paraphrase(coverText, { bias: keywords });\n      return stegoText;\n  } catch(error) {\n      console.error(\"Encoding error:\", error);\n      return null;\n  }\n}\n\nfunction selectKeywords(key) {\n  // Use the key to pseudo-randomly select keywords from a dictionary.\n  // This is a placeholder for your keyword selection logic.\n  const dictionary = [\"word1\", \"word2\", \"word3\", /* ... */]; // Your dictionary\n  const prng = new Math.seedrandom(key); // Seed a PRNG with the key\n\n  const numKeywords = 10; // Example: select 10 keywords\n  const keywords = [];\n  for (let i = 0; i < numKeywords; i++) {\n    const randomIndex = Math.floor(prng() * dictionary.length); \n    keywords.push(dictionary[randomIndex]);\n  }\n  return keywords;\n}\n\n// Example Usage:\nconst stegoText = await encode(text, \"mySecretKey\");\n```\n\n* **Explanation:** This code demonstrates how to encode a message.  `selectKeywords()` uses the `seedrandom` library to create a repeatable pseudo-random number generator based on the key. This ensures that both the sender and receiver can generate the same set of keywords.  The `encode()` function would use a language model API (like an interface to Llama) to paraphrase the text, biasing the word sampling process towards the selected keywords. The example shows a simplified API call; the actual integration with an LLM would be more complex, involving tokenization, probability adjustments, and decoding.\n\n**4.  Narration (Equation 7):**\n\n```javascript\nasync function narrate(stegoText, coverAudio) {\n  // Use a text-to-speech (TTS) model/API, potentially with voice cloning.\n  try {\n      const stegoAudio = await ttsAPI.synthesize(stegoText, { voice: coverAudio });\n      return stegoAudio;\n  } catch(error) {\n      console.error(\"Narration error:\", error);\n      return null;\n  }\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nconst stegoAudio = await narrate(stegoText, audio);\n```\n\n* **Explanation:**  This function uses a TTS system to generate audio from the stego text.  The placeholder should be replaced with a call to a real TTS engine (e.g., the Web Speech API, or a server-side TTS service like Coqui XTTS).  Voice cloning is implied but would require a dedicated voice cloning system integrated into the TTS process.\n\nThe remaining equations (multiplexing, synchronization, decoding) follow a similar pattern of wrapping external libraries or APIs in JavaScript functions. The core of the implementation relies on choosing and correctly integrating those libraries and APIs to handle the multimedia processing and LLM interaction.",
