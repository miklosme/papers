  "title": "FROM IDEA TO CAD: A LANGUAGE MODEL-DRIVEN MULTI-AGENT SYSTEM FOR COLLABORATIVE DESIGN",
  "abstract": "Creating digital models using Computer Aided Design (CAD) is a process that requires in-depth expertise. In industrial product development, this process typically involves entire teams of engineers, spanning requirements engineering, CAD itself, and quality assurance. We present an approach that mirrors this team structure with a Vision Language Model (VLM)-based Multi Agent System, with access to parametric CAD tooling and tool documentation. Combining agents for requirements engineering, CAD engineering, and vision-based quality assurance, a model is generated automatically from sketches and/ or textual descriptions. The resulting model can be refined collaboratively in an iterative validation loop with the user. Our approach has the potential to increase the effectiveness of design processes, both for industry experts and for hobbyists who create models for 3D printing. We demonstrate the potential of the architecture at the example of various design tasks and provide several ablations that show the benefits of the architecture's individual components.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces a language model-driven multi-agent system (MAS) for collaborative computer-aided design (CAD).  The MAS automates CAD model creation from sketches and text descriptions, mimicking a human engineering team with specialized agents for requirements engineering, CAD design, and quality assurance.  Key points for LLM-based multi-agent systems include: specialized agent roles, iterative feedback loops for refinement and validation with both AI and human input, use of visual feedback to address LLM limitations in spatial reasoning, and integration with external tools and documentation (e.g., CadQuery). The system demonstrates improved design quality compared to directly prompting a single LLM, highlighting the potential of multi-agent architectures in CAD applications.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents a fascinating approach to collaborative design using LLMs and a multi-agent system, offering several avenues for JavaScript developers to explore within web development:\n\n**Practical Examples for JavaScript Developers:**\n\n1. **Interactive Design Tool:** Imagine a web-based CAD tool where users sketch or describe an object using natural language.  A JavaScript frontend could capture user input (sketch data, text) and send it to a backend implementing the multi-agent system.\n\n    * **Frontend (JavaScript):**  Use libraries like Fabric.js or Konva for canvas-based sketching, and standard HTML inputs for text descriptions. Frameworks like React, Vue, or Svelte can manage the UI and user interactions.\n    * **Backend (Node.js):** Implement the agents (RequirementsEngineer, CadEngineer, QualityAssuranceEngineer) using a Node.js library like LangChain to interact with the chosen LLM (e.g., OpenAI, Cohere). The CadEngineer agent would generate OpenSCAD or similar code and then execute it using a library like openjscad or a backend service to generate 3D models.  Communicate back to the frontend using WebSockets or Server-Sent Events for real-time feedback and updates.\n\n2. **Collaborative 3D Modeling Platform:** Extend the above concept to a collaborative environment where multiple users can design together. Each user could have their own set of agents acting as their personal design assistants, and these agents could communicate with each other (through a message queue like Redis) to negotiate design choices.  The platform would synchronize the evolving 3D model in real-time across all users.\n\n    * **Frontend (JavaScript):** Three.js or Babylon.js would be ideal for rendering the 3D models on the client-side. Implement user roles and permissions using a library like Casl.\n    * **Backend (Node.js):**  Manage the multi-agent communication and model synchronization.  Consider using a database like MongoDB to store design history and user preferences.\n\n3. **Automated Design Documentation:**  A web app could automatically generate documentation for 3D models created using the multi-agent system. The QualityAssuranceEngineer agent could be extended to generate reports highlighting design choices, potential issues, and suggested improvements.\n\n    * **Frontend (JavaScript):**  Display the generated documentation in a user-friendly format using a rich text editor or markdown renderer.\n    * **Backend (Node.js):** The QualityAssuranceEngineer agent would use the LLM to generate documentation based on the design process, the generated code, and the 3D model itself.\n\n\n4. **Accessibility for Novice Users:**  Create a simplified design tool for non-technical users.  The RequirementsEngineer agent would play a crucial role here, guiding users through the design process and providing helpful suggestions.\n\n    * **Frontend (JavaScript):** Focus on a clean and intuitive UI.  Use clear prompts and visual cues to help users articulate their design ideas.\n    * **Backend (Node.js):**  Implement a more robust error handling system to anticipate and correct common design mistakes.  Consider using a simpler CAD library like CSG.js for less complex designs.\n\n\n\n**Key Considerations for Implementation:**\n\n* **LLM Choice:**  The paper uses GPT-4, but other LLMs might be suitable depending on performance and cost considerations.  Experiment with different models to find the best balance.\n* **CAD Library:** CadQuery (Python) is used in the paper. For a JavaScript implementation, explore OpenSCAD, openjscad, or CSG.js.  Consider backend services like Tinkercad's API for more advanced features.\n* **Agent Communication:** Design a clear communication protocol between agents.  Message queues (e.g., Redis, RabbitMQ) or a shared database could be used for asynchronous communication.\n* **User Interface:**  A well-designed user interface is critical for the success of any collaborative design tool. Prioritize user experience and accessibility.\n\n\nBy combining the insights from the paper with readily available JavaScript technologies, developers can create innovative web applications that empower users to design and create 3D models with unprecedented ease and collaboration. This opens up exciting possibilities for democratizing design and pushing the boundaries of web-based 3D modeling.",
  "pseudocode": "The paper contains four pseudocode blocks representing algorithms. Here are their JavaScript translations and explanations:\n\n**Algorithm 1: Interactive Requirement Specification**\n\n```javascript\nasync function interactiveRequirementSpecification(sketch, text, vlm) {\n  let ambiguities = await vlm.prompt(\"promptclarify\", sketch, text);\n  let user_input = \"\";\n\n  while (ambiguities.length > 0) {\n    console.log(ambiguities); // Show ambiguities to the user\n    user_input = await prompt(\"Please provide more information:\"); // Get user input\n    text += user_input;\n    ambiguities = await vlm.prompt(\"promptclarify\", sketch, text); // Check for remaining ambiguities\n  }\n\n  return { sketch, text }; // Return the finalized specification\n}\n\n\n```\n\n* **Purpose:** This algorithm clarifies design requirements by iteratively interacting with the user. It takes a sketch, textual description, and a Vision-Language Model (VLM) as input.  The VLM identifies ambiguities in the input and prompts the user for further clarification. This process repeats until the specification is deemed unambiguous by the VLM.\n\n**Algorithm 2: Model Design**\n\n```javascript\nasync function modelDesign(specification, docsUrl, feedback, vlm) {\n  const docs = await fetch(docsUrl).then(res => res.text()); // Fetch CadQuery documentation\n  let hints = \"\";\n  let plan = \"\";\n\n  if (feedback) {\n    plan = await vlm.prompt(\"promptplan\", specification);\n  }\n\n  let model = null;\n  while (!model) {\n    if (feedback) {\n      hints = await vlm.prompt(\"promptdocs\", docs, feedback);\n    }\n\n    const code = await vlm.prompt(\"promptcode\", specification, hints);\n\n    if (await checkCode(code)) { // Check if code is valid\n      model = await executeCode(code); // Execute CadQuery code\n      if (model) {\n        const filename = \"/path/to/model.stl\"; //Replace with actual path\n        await saveModel(model, filename);\n      }\n\n    }\n  }\n  return { code, model };\n}\n\n// Placeholder functions - replace with actual implementations\nasync function checkCode(code) { /* ... */ return true; }\nasync function executeCode(code) { /* ... */ return \"model object\"; }\nasync function saveModel(model, filename) { /* ... */  }\n\n```\n\n* **Purpose:** This algorithm generates a 3D model based on a given specification. It leverages a VLM to create Python code using the CadQuery library.  It incorporates feedback from a verification process and documentation to refine the code iteratively until a valid 3D model is generated. Assumes helper functions `checkCode`, `executeCode`, and `saveModel` are implemented elsewhere.\n\n**Algorithm 3: VLM-Based Verification**\n\n```javascript\nasync function vlmBasedVerification(specification, userFeedback, vlm) {\n  let verificationFeedback = \"\";\n  let model = null;\n\n  while (true) {\n    model = await modelDesign(specification, \"documentationURL\", userFeedback + verificationFeedback, vlm);\n    const views = await renderModel(model); // Generate views of the model\n    verificationFeedback = await vlm.prompt(\"promptqa\", specification, views);\n    if (!userFeedback) { // Exit if there is no user feedback.\n      break;\n    }\n  }\n  return { verificationFeedback, model };\n}\n\n// Placeholder function, replace with an actual implementation\nasync function renderModel(model) {  /* ... */  return [\"view1\",\"view2\"]; }\n```\n\n* **Purpose:** This algorithm verifies the generated 3D model against the given specification. It generates different views of the model and uses a VLM to compare these views with the specification. It provides feedback for further improvement if discrepancies are found.  Requires `renderModel` to be implemented, which generates views of the 3D model.\n\n**Algorithm 4: Human Validation**\n\n```javascript\nasync function humanValidation(specification, vlm) {\n  let userFeedback = \"\";\n  let model;\n  while (true) {\n    let result = await modelDesign(specification, \"documentationURL\", userFeedback, vlm);\n    model = result.model;\n    showModelToUser(model); // Display the model to the user\n\n    userFeedback = await prompt(\"Please provide feedback or press Enter if satisfied:\"); // Get user feedback\n\n    if (!userFeedback) {\n      break; // Exit if user is satisfied\n    }\n\n  }\n  return model; // Returns the validated 3D model\n}\n\n\n//Placeholder function: should display the model to the user somehow\nasync function showModelToUser(model) { /* ... */ }\n```\n\n* **Purpose:** This algorithm validates the generated model by involving human feedback. The generated model is presented to the user, who can provide feedback. This feedback is then incorporated in subsequent iterations of the design process until the user is satisfied with the model.  Assumes a function `showModelToUser` which allows the user to view the generated 3D model.",
