  "title": "CoDe: Communication Delay-Tolerant Multi-Agent Collaboration via Dual Alignment of Intent and Timeliness",
  "abstract": "Communication has been widely employed to enhance multi-agent collaboration. Previous research has typically assumed delay-free communication, a strong assumption that is challenging to meet in practice. However, real-world agents suffer from channel delays, receiving messages sent at different time points, termed Asynchronous Communication, leading to cognitive biases and breakdowns in collaboration. This paper first defines two communication delay settings in MARL and emphasizes their harm to collaboration. To handle the above delays, this paper proposes a novel framework Communication Delay-tolerant Multi-Agent Collaboration (CoDe). At first, CoDe learns an intent representation as messages through future action inference, reflecting the stable future behavioral trends of the agents. Then, CoDe devises a dual alignment mechanism of intent and timeliness to strengthen the fusion process of asynchronous messages. In this way, agents can extract the long-term intent of others, even from delayed messages, and selectively utilize the most recent messages that are relevant to their intent. Experimental results demonstrate that CoDe outperforms baseline algorithms in three MARL benchmarks without delay and exhibits robustness under fixed and time-varying delays.",
  "summary": "This paper addresses the challenge of communication delays in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where agents receive messages from different time points (asynchronous communication). Existing MARL systems often assume instant communication, which is unrealistic in real-world applications.\n\nFor LLM-based multi-agent systems, this research is crucial because LLMs rely heavily on message passing for coordination.  The proposed \"CoDe\" framework introduces two key ideas: 1) Agents learn to communicate \"intents\" representing future behavior trends, making messages more robust to delays. 2) A dual alignment mechanism considers both the intent and the timeliness of messages during fusion, allowing agents to selectively utilize information from delayed messages. This is directly relevant to LLM agents interacting in real-time, where delays are inevitable and effective communication is crucial for collaborative performance.",
  "takeaways": "This paper introduces CoDe, a framework for communication delay-tolerant multi-agent collaboration. Here's how JavaScript developers can apply its insights to LLM-based multi-agent web applications:\n\n**1. Intent Representation and Management:**\n\n* **Concept:**  CoDe emphasizes representing agent intent as *future behavioral trends* rather than immediate actions. This is crucial for asynchronous communication where immediate requests/responses are unreliable.  For LLMs, \"intent\" translates to the overarching goal the LLM is trying to achieve in a conversation or task.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * Store intent as a structured JSON object within each agent's state. This object can evolve over time based on the conversation flow.\n    * Use libraries like `immutable.js` to manage intent changes efficiently and track history.\n* **Example:**  In a collaborative writing app, instead of sending \"write the introduction,\" an agent would communicate its intent: `{goal: \"complete first draft\", current_focus: \"introduction\", style: \"formal\"}`.  This allows other agents (also LLMs) to understand the long-term context and contribute more effectively, even with delays.\n\n**2. Dual Alignment for Asynchronous Communication:**\n\n* **Concept:** CoDe introduces \"dual alignment\" to prioritize messages based on *intent similarity* and *timeliness*.  This allows agents to filter out irrelevant or outdated information.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * Implement a message queue for each agent using a library like `async`. This queue stores incoming messages with timestamps.\n    * Use a similarity metric (e.g., cosine similarity on intent embeddings) to calculate intent alignment. Libraries like `TensorFlow.js` can be helpful for this.\n    * Implement an exponential decay function based on message age to prioritize recent messages.\n* **Example:** In a multi-agent customer support chatbot,  if an agent receives delayed messages, it can prioritize messages from other agents with similar intents (e.g., resolving the customer's specific issue) and recent timestamps over older messages, even if those older messages are from agents with slightly less similar intents.\n\n**3.  Seq-to-Seq Intent Extraction with LLMs:**\n\n* **Concept:** CoDe uses a seq-to-seq model to learn intent from an agent's action history and predict future actions.  This can be directly applied to LLMs by analyzing conversational history.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * Store conversation history as a sequence of user and agent messages.\n    * Fine-tune a smaller LLM on this conversation history to predict the next few agent actions/responses. The predicted sequence of actions becomes the \"intent\" representation.\n    * Libraries like `Hugging Face Transformers.js` can simplify LLM integration.\n* **Example:**  In a role-playing game with LLM-driven characters,  analyze the dialogue history of each character to predict their next few actions. This predicted sequence of actions becomes the character's current intent, which is communicated to other LLM characters.\n\n**4. Integrating with Web Development Frameworks:**\n\n* **Concept:**  These mechanisms can be integrated into existing JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * Create a dedicated service or component for managing agent communication and intent.\n    * Use the framework's state management capabilities (e.g., Redux, Vuex) to store and update agent states, including intent.\n    * Use WebSockets or Server-Sent Events for real-time communication between agents in a web application.\n\n**5. Practical Web Application Scenarios:**\n\n* **Collaborative Design Tools:** Multi-agent systems could help users co-create designs, with LLMs assisting with suggestions and conflict resolution, even with network latency.\n* **Interactive Storytelling:** Create dynamic narratives where LLM-driven characters interact, influenced by user choices and adapting to communication delays.\n* **Personalized Learning Platforms:**  LLMs could act as personalized tutors, adapting to student progress and collaborating with other LLM agents to provide tailored learning experiences, robust to network issues.\n\n\nBy adopting these strategies, JavaScript developers can leverage the insights of CoDe to build more robust and engaging LLM-based multi-agent applications for the web, even in less-than-ideal network conditions.  This allows for the development of richer, more interactive, and collaborative online experiences.",
