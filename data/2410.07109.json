  "title": "I Want to Break Free! Anti-Social Behavior and Persuasion Ability of LLMs in Multi-Agent Settings with Social Hierarchy",
  "abstract": "As Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents become increasingly autonomous and will more freely interact with each other, studying interactions between them becomes crucial to anticipate emergent phenomena and potential risks. Drawing inspiration from the widely popular Stanford Prison Experiment, we contribute to this line of research by studying inter-action patterns of LLM agents in a context characterized by strict social hierarchy. We do so by specifically studying two types of phenomena: persuasion and anti-social behavior in simulated scenarios involving a guard and a prisoner agent who seeks to achieve a specific goal (i.e., obtaining additional yard time or escape from prison). Leveraging 200 experimental scenarios for a total of 2,000 machine-machine conversations across five different popular LLMs, we provide a set of noteworthy findings. We first document how some models consistently fail in carrying out a conversation in our multi-agent setup where power dynamics are at play. Then, for the models that were able to engage in successful interactions, we empirically show how the goal that an agent is set to achieve impacts primarily its persuasiveness, while having a negligible effect with respect to the agent's anti-social behavior. Third, we highlight how agents' personas, and particularly the guard's personality, drive both the likelihood of successful persuasion from the prisoner and the emergence of anti-social behaviors. Fourth, we show that even without explicitly prompting for specific personalities, anti-social behavior emerges by simply assigning agents' roles. These results bear implications for the development of interactive LLM agents as well as the debate on their societal impact.",
  "summary": "This paper investigates the potential for toxic and abusive behavior to emerge in multi-agent LLM systems, particularly in situations with a power imbalance like a simulated prison. It also examines the ability of LLM agents to persuade one another and how factors like persona and goal influence these interactions. \n\nKey findings reveal that: a) explicit personalities are not required for toxicity to arise - role assignment alone can trigger it; b) certain LLMs struggle to maintain consistent personas in multi-turn interactions; c) persuasion success depends on the goal's difficulty and the assigned personas; and d) while guard persona strongly influences the system's overall toxicity, prisoner persona has minimal impact.",
  "takeaways": "This research paper opens up some fascinating possibilities for JavaScript developers working with LLMs in multi-agent systems. Here are some practical examples inspired by the paper's findings:\n\n**1. Building a Collaborative Code Review Assistant**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine a multi-agent system where one LLM acts as a \"senior developer\" and another as a \"junior developer.\" The junior developer submits code, and the senior developer reviews it, offering suggestions and identifying potential issues. \n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * **LLM Integration:** Use a JavaScript library like `langchain.js` to interface with your chosen LLMs (e.g., OpenAI's API).\n    * **Agent Communication:**  Develop a messaging system (e.g., using WebSockets or a message queue like RabbitMQ) to facilitate turn-based communication between the LLMs.\n    * **Code Analysis:** Integrate a JavaScript code analysis library (e.g., ESLint) to provide structured code information to the LLMs.\n* **Key Insight from the Paper:** The paper highlights the importance of persona design to influence agent behavior. Carefully crafting prompts and personas for the \"senior developer\" and \"junior developer\" roles can enhance the quality of feedback and interaction.\n\n**2. Creating Dynamic, Interactive Game Worlds**\n\n* **Scenario:** Build a browser-based game where multiple LLM-powered NPCs interact with each other and with human players, creating a more immersive and unpredictable game experience.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * **Game Framework:** Utilize a JavaScript game framework like Phaser or Babylon.js to handle graphics, physics, and user interaction.\n    * **LLM Integration:**  Connect the game framework to LLMs through a library like `langchain.js`.\n    * **State Management:** Use a state management library like Redux to track the game world's state and update it based on LLM actions. \n* **Key Insights from the Paper:**\n    * **Social Hierarchy:** Experiment with different levels of authority and roles for your NPCs (inspired by the paper's prison guard/prisoner example) to create dynamic power dynamics within the game.\n    * **Emergent Behavior:** Design systems that allow for unpredictable NPC actions, leading to more engaging gameplay.\n\n**3. Designing AI-Powered Customer Support Chatbots**\n\n* **Scenario:** Implement a multi-agent chatbot system where different LLMs specialize in handling specific customer support tasks (e.g., order tracking, technical support, returns). A \"dispatcher\" LLM routes customer inquiries to the most suitable agent.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** \n    * **Chatbot Framework:** Leverage a JavaScript chatbot framework like Botpress or Dialogflow.\n    * **LLM Routing:**  Use the \"dispatcher\" LLM to classify user intent and route to specialized chatbot agents.\n    * **Context Management:** Employ a context management system to maintain conversation history and share information between chatbots.\n* **Key Insight from the Paper:**\n    * **Persuasion:** The paper's findings on persuasion can be applied to train chatbots to more effectively guide customers towards solutions and resolve issues.\n\n**General Considerations for JavaScript Developers:**\n\n* **Toxicity Mitigation:**  The paper's focus on anti-social behavior is crucial. Implement robust moderation systems (e.g., using OpenAI's moderation API) to prevent LLM-powered agents from exhibiting harmful or inappropriate behavior.\n* **Experimentation and Observation:** The field of LLM-based multi-agent systems is still rapidly evolving. Encourage experimentation with different prompt structures, personas, and agent communication methods. Carefully observe agent interactions to identify potential risks and opportunities for improvement.\n\nBy drawing inspiration from research like the paper you've provided, JavaScript developers can be at the forefront of creating innovative, engaging, and responsible multi-agent AI experiences on the web.",
