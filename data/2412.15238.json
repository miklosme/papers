  "title": "Dipper: Diversity in Prompts for Producing Large Language Model Ensembles in Reasoning tasks",
  "abstract": "Large Language Models still encounter substantial challenges in reasoning tasks, especially for smaller models, which many users may be restricted to due to resource constraints (e.g., GPU memory restrictions). Inference-time methods to boost LLM performance, such as prompting methods to invoke certain reasoning pathways in responses, have been shown effective in past works, though they largely rely on sequential queries. The ensemble method, which consists of multiple constituent models running in parallel, is a promising approach to achieving better inference-time performance, especially given recent developments that enabled significant speed-ups in LLM batch inference. In this work, we propose a novel, training-free LLM ensemble framework where a single LLM model is fed an optimized, diverse set of prompts in parallel, effectively producing an ensemble at inference time to achieve performance improvement in reasoning tasks. We empirically demonstrate that our method leads to significant gains on math reasoning tasks, e.g., on MATH, where our ensemble consisting of a few small models (e.g., three Qwen2-MATH-1.5B-it models) can outperform a larger model (e.g., Qwen2-MATH-7B-it).",
  "summary": "This paper introduces Dipper, a method for creating ensembles of large language models (LLMs) by using diverse prompts rather than multiple model instances. This allows for improved performance on reasoning tasks, particularly for smaller LLMs with resource constraints.\n\nKey points for LLM-based multi-agent systems:\n\n* **Prompt Engineering for Diversity:** Dipper emphasizes the importance of diverse prompts in generating a range of reasoning pathways within the ensemble.  This highlights prompt engineering as a key element in multi-agent LLM system design.\n* **Homogeneous Agents with Diverse Behaviors:** Dipper demonstrates that even with identical LLMs (homogeneous agents), varied behaviors can be elicited through prompt diversity, suggesting a new approach to specialization within a multi-agent system.\n* **Optimization of Prompt Selection:** The paper introduces a method for optimizing prompt selection based on fidelity (performance on a development set) and diversity (semantic difference between prompts), which is crucial for effective multi-agent collaboration.\n* **Response Aggregation:** Dipper explores different methods for combining agent outputs, including majority voting and using another LLM as an aggregator, highlighting the importance of aggregation strategies in multi-agent systems.\n* **Synergy with other Prompting Techniques:** Dipper's compatibility with techniques like Reflexion underscores its potential for integration within broader multi-agent frameworks and interaction paradigms.",
  "takeaways": "This paper introduces Dipper, a method for creating diverse prompt ensembles to improve LLM performance on reasoning tasks, particularly useful for web developers working with smaller LLMs due to resource constraints on the client-side. Here are practical examples of how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights:\n\n**1. Multi-Agent Collaborative Content Creation:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  Imagine building a web app where multiple LLM agents collaborate on writing a story, script, or article.  Each agent contributes a paragraph or scene.\n* **Dipper Application:**  Instead of giving each agent the same prompt (e.g., \"Write the next paragraph\"), use Dipper to generate a diverse set of prompts.  For instance, one prompt might be \"Write a descriptive paragraph focusing on the setting,\" while another could be \"Introduce a conflict in this paragraph.\" This diversity leads to more varied and engaging outputs from each agent, resulting in a richer final product.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * Use a JavaScript LLM library like `langchain.js` or a cloud-based API to interface with the LLMs.\n    * Implement the prompt generation and selection algorithm using a JavaScript library for matrix operations like `math.js` or `numeric.js` to calculate semantic volume.  You'll also need a sentence embedding model like the one from `sentence-transformers`, possibly through a server-side API if running client-side is too resource-intensive.\n    * A simple majority voting system can be implemented for the response aggregator.  For more sophisticated aggregation, you can use another LLM call (as suggested by the paper) to combine the agent outputs.\n\n**2. Interactive Dialogue Systems with Diverse Personalities:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Create a chatbot or virtual assistant with multiple “sub-personalities.”  Each sub-personality has a distinct conversational style and area of expertise.\n* **Dipper Application:** Use Dipper to craft prompts that elicit these different personalities. Example prompts: “Respond as a sarcastic comedian,” “Respond as a helpful customer service agent,” “Respond with factual information as a historian.” This enhances user engagement and allows for more dynamic conversations.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * Integrate a frontend framework like React or Vue.js to manage the UI and user interactions.\n    * Use Dipper to select the appropriate sub-personality (and its corresponding prompt) based on the user input and context. The semantic similarity between user input and prompt descriptions can guide this selection.\n    * Use a state management library like Redux or Zustand to track the conversation history and the current active personality.\n\n**3. Personalized Recommendations with Multi-Agent Reasoning:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Develop a web app recommending products, movies, or articles.  Different LLM agents consider various factors like user preferences, recent trends, or expert opinions.\n* **Dipper Application:** Use diverse prompts to guide the agents' reasoning.  For example: \"Recommend a movie based on the user's past ratings,\" \"Recommend a movie based on current trending topics,\" \"Recommend a movie critically acclaimed by experts.\" The combined recommendations from these agents offer a more robust and personalized experience.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * Fetch user data (e.g., ratings, browsing history) and external data (e.g., trending topics, reviews) using JavaScript's `fetch` API.\n    * Use Dipper to generate prompts based on the available data and the desired recommendation strategy.\n    * Aggregate the recommendations using a ranking algorithm or a learned aggregator LLM.\n\n**Key Considerations for JavaScript Developers:**\n\n* **Client-side vs. Server-side:**  The computationally intensive parts of Dipper (prompt generation and selection) can be offloaded to a server to improve client-side performance.\n* **Library Choices:** `langchain.js` offers convenient abstractions for working with LLMs, while libraries like `math.js` are helpful for matrix operations.\n* **Asynchronous Operations:**  LLM calls are asynchronous. Use `async/await` or Promises effectively to manage the agent interactions.\n* **Experimentation:** Start with a small number of agents and prompts to explore the impact of diversity and fine-tune your implementation.\n\n\nBy understanding and applying the core concepts of Dipper, JavaScript developers can harness the power of multi-agent LLM systems to create more engaging, personalized, and intelligent web applications.  This paper provides a solid foundation for experimenting with different prompt engineering strategies and pushing the boundaries of web development with LLMs.",

The core idea is that different prompts can elicit different reasoning pathways in the LLM, leading to more diverse and potentially more accurate answers when aggregated.\n\n**Key Steps:**\n\n1. **Prompt Fidelity Calculation (Lines 4-6):** The algorithm first assesses the *fidelity* of each prompt in the initial candidate set `W`. Fidelity measures how well a prompt guides the LLM to produce correct answers on a development set (`Ta`). It calculates the accuracy of the LLM on `Ta` when using each prompt.\n\n2. **Greedy Selection based on Semantic Volume (Lines 7-18):** The algorithm then iteratively selects prompts to build the ensemble set `Z`. The selection process is greedy, meaning it chooses the best prompt at each step based on a metric called *fidelity-adjusted semantic volume*.\n\n3. **Semantic Volume and Diversity (Lines 10-13):**  Semantic volume quantifies the diversity of the prompts in the current subset `P`. Each prompt is embedded into a semantic vector space using an embedding model `Ms`. The determinant of the Gram matrix (formed by the embeddings multiplied by their transpose) is then used. A larger determinant indicates a larger volume spanned by the prompt vectors, signifying higher diversity.  The fidelity adjustment (scaling by `exp(alpha * u / 2)`) prioritizes prompts that have demonstrated higher accuracy on the development set.\n\n4. **Iteration and Update (Lines 7-18):** The algorithm iteratively adds the prompt that maximizes the fidelity-adjusted semantic volume to the ensemble set `Z`. This continues until the desired ensemble size (`n`) is reached.\n\n5. **Return Ensemble Prompts (Line 19):** The algorithm returns the selected prompts `Z`, which will be used to guide the individual LLMs in the ensemble.\n\n**Purpose:**\n\nThe main purpose of the DIPPER algorithm is to efficiently select a diverse and performant set of prompts to create an LLM ensemble.  By maximizing diversity, the algorithm attempts to encourage the ensemble to explore different reasoning strategies, ultimately leading to improved overall accuracy and robustness compared to a single LLM or a less diverse ensemble. This approach avoids the computational cost of training separate LLM models for the ensemble. The code provides a functional skeleton that needs to be adapted with specific implementations of the LLM `M`, the embedding model `Ms`, and a suitable method to extract the final answer from the LLM's output `extractAnswer`.  Additionally, the `mathjs` library is used for matrix and vector operations.",
