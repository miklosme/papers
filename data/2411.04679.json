  "title": "CAPO: COOPERATIVE PLAN OPTIMIZATION FOR EFFICIENT EMBODIED MULTI-AGENT COOPERATION",
  "abstract": "In this work, we address the cooperation problem among large language model (LLM) based embodied agents, where agents must cooperate to achieve a common goal. Previous methods often execute actions extemporaneously and incoherently, without long-term strategic and cooperative planning, leading to redundant steps, failures, and even serious repercussions in complex tasks like search-and-rescue missions where discussion and cooperative plan are crucial. To solve this issue, we propose Cooperative Plan Optimization (CaPo) to enhance the cooperation efficiency of LLM-based embodied agents. Inspired by human cooperation schemes, CaPo improves cooperation efficiency with two phases: 1) meta-plan generation, and 2) progress-adaptive meta-plan and execution. In the first phase, all agents analyze the task, discuss, and cooperatively create a meta-plan that decomposes the task into subtasks with detailed steps, ensuring a long-term strategic and coherent plan for efficient coordination. In the second phase, agents execute tasks according to the meta-plan and dynamically adjust it based on their latest progress (e.g., discovering a target object) through multi-turn discussions. This progress-based adaptation eliminates redundant actions, improving the overall cooperation efficiency of agents. Experimental results on the ThreeDworld Multi-Agent Transport and Communicative Watch-And-Help tasks demonstrate CaPo's much higher task completion rate and efficiency compared with state-of-the-arts.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces CaPo, a framework for improving the cooperation efficiency of LLM-based embodied agents in accomplishing shared tasks. CaPo enables agents to collaboratively create a long-term \"meta-plan\" and dynamically adapt it based on task progress, improving coordination and reducing redundant actions. Key features include multi-turn discussions for meta-plan creation and refinement, progress-triggered meta-plan updates, and distinct roles for agents (meta-plan designer and evaluators). This approach promotes more strategic and coherent collaboration compared to existing methods that rely on short-term or individual planning.",
  "takeaways": "This paper introduces CaPo, a framework for enhancing cooperation between LLM-based embodied agents. Here are some practical examples of how a JavaScript developer can apply CaPo's insights to LLM-based multi-agent AI projects, focusing on web development scenarios:\n\n**1. Collaborative Web Design:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine building a web app where multiple LLMs collaborate to design a website based on user input.  One LLM could focus on generating HTML structure, another on CSS styling, and a third on JavaScript interactivity.\n* **CaPo Application:**  Implement a meta-plan generation phase where the LLMs discuss and agree on a high-level design blueprint. This plan could outline sections of the website, overall style, and key interactive elements.  Use a JavaScript library like `LangChain` to manage prompts and responses between LLMs, structuring the conversation based on the CaPo framework.  During the execution phase, each LLM focuses on its assigned subtask, updating a shared JSON representation of the website design.  Use a reactive JavaScript framework like `React` or `Vue` to update the visual representation of the website in real-time as the LLMs make progress.\n* **Progress-Adaptive Plan:**  If the styling LLM discovers a conflict with the HTML structure, it could trigger a discussion to update the meta-plan. This could involve modifying the HTML structure or adjusting the styling approach. The progress updates can be communicated through a message queue system implemented in JavaScript using libraries like `Socket.IO` or `MQTT.js`.\n\n**2. Multi-Agent Customer Support Chatbot:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Develop a customer support system with multiple specialized chatbot LLMs. One LLM handles shipping inquiries, another deals with product information, and a third manages returns.\n* **CaPo Application:**  When a user initiates a chat, a \"coordinator\" LLM analyzes the user's initial message to determine which specialized LLM is most relevant. This coordinator LLM acts as the meta-plan generator, assigning the initial conversation to the appropriate specialist.  The conversation history and user data can be managed using a JavaScript-based database like `PouchDB` or `localForage`.\n* **Progress-Adaptive Plan:** If the initial specialist cannot resolve the issue, it triggers a discussion with the coordinator LLM.  The coordinator then updates the meta-plan by reassigning the conversation to a different specialist or initiating a collaborative effort between multiple specialists. This handoff can be seamlessly implemented in JavaScript using a state management library like `Redux` or `MobX`.\n\n**3. Real-time Collaborative Code Editor:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Build a collaborative coding platform where multiple LLMs assist users in writing code. One LLM suggests code completions, another debugs code, and a third generates documentation.\n* **CaPo Application:** Implement a shared coding environment using a JavaScript library like `CodeMirror` or `Monaco Editor`. The LLMs discuss a meta-plan for the coding task, outlining the functionalities to be implemented and their dependencies.  Each LLM then focuses on its specific subtask within the shared code editor.\n* **Progress-Adaptive Plan:** If the debugging LLM detects a bug, it triggers a discussion to revise the meta-plan. This could involve rewriting a section of code, adding more test cases, or adjusting the overall design.  The progress updates and discussion messages can be displayed in real-time within the code editor interface using JavaScript and websockets.\n\n**JavaScript Libraries and Frameworks:**\n\n* **LangChain:** Manage prompt engineering and facilitate conversations between LLMs.\n* **React/Vue:**  Update the user interface dynamically based on LLM actions.\n* **Socket.IO/MQTT.js:** Implement real-time communication between LLMs for progress updates and discussions.\n* **PouchDB/localForage:**  Store and manage data related to the multi-agent system.\n* **Redux/MobX:** Manage the state and interactions of different LLM agents.\n* **CodeMirror/Monaco Editor:** Create a collaborative coding environment.\n\n\nBy leveraging these JavaScript technologies and following the principles of CaPo, developers can create engaging and sophisticated multi-agent web applications that effectively harness the power of LLMs. Remember to focus on creating clear communication channels, defining roles and responsibilities for each LLM, and implementing a robust mechanism for adapting plans based on progress.",
  "pseudocode": "No pseudocode block found. However, the paper describes a novel approach to multi-agent planning and execution using Large Language Models (LLMs), which can be conceptually translated into JavaScript code structures.  While the paper doesn't provide explicit pseudocode, its core logic can be represented using JavaScript functions and objects, leveraging the asynchronous nature of JavaScript for communication between agents.  Let's illustrate some key aspects:\n\n**1. Meta-plan Generation:**\n\n```javascript\nasync function generateMetaPlan(taskDescription, agentInfo) {\n  let metaPlan = await callLLM(\n    taskDescription,\n    \"Generate a meta-plan...\", // Instructions for LLM\n    agentInfo\n  );\n\n  let feedback = await getFeedbackFromTeammates(metaPlan);\n  while (!feedback.satisfied && !communicationBudgetExceeded()) {\n    metaPlan = await refineMetaPlan(metaPlan, feedback);\n    feedback = await getFeedbackFromTeammates(metaPlan);\n  }\n  return metaPlan;\n}\n\n\nasync function getFeedbackFromTeammates(metaPlan) {\n  // Broadcast meta-plan to teammates and gather feedback\n  const feedbackPromises = teammates.map(\n    teammate => teammate.evaluateMetaPlan(metaPlan)\n  );\n  return Promise.all(feedbackPromises);\n}\n```\n\nThis code snippet showcases how the meta-plan generation could be implemented in JavaScript.  `callLLM` would be a function that interacts with the LLM API (e.g., OpenAI's API). `getFeedbackFromTeammates` demonstrates gathering feedback from other agents, potentially through a message broker or peer-to-peer communication using WebRTC.  The loop simulates iterative refinement until consensus is reached or the communication budget runs out.\n\n\n**2. Progress-Adaptive Meta-plan and Execution:**\n\n```javascript\nasync function executeMetaPlan(metaPlan) {\n  let currentSubPlan = parseMetaPlan(metaPlan, currentProgress);\n\n  while (!taskCompleted(currentProgress)) {\n    const action = await executeAction(currentSubPlan);\n    currentProgress = updateProgress(currentProgress, action);\n\n    if (significantProgressMade(currentProgress)) {\n      metaPlan = await adaptMetaPlan(metaPlan, currentProgress);\n      currentSubPlan = parseMetaPlan(metaPlan, currentProgress);\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHere, `parseMetaPlan` extracts the relevant sub-plan from the meta-plan based on the current progress. `executeAction` executes a single action, and `updateProgress` reflects the result of that action. If significant progress is detected by `significantProgressMade`, the meta-plan is adapted using a similar discussion and refinement process as in meta-plan generation.\n\n\n\n**3. Communication Module:**\n\n\n```javascript\nasync function sendMessage(recipient, messageContent) {\n  const message = await callLLM(\n      currentTaskDescription, \n      \"Generate a message...\",\n      metaPlan, \n      agentState, \n      dialogHistory,\n      messageContent\n  );\n  recipient.receiveMessage(message); // Send message to recipient \n}\n```\nThis function uses the LLM to craft a message incorporating the current context, and then sends it to the intended recipient. This could be done through WebSockets or server-sent events for real-time interaction between agents.\n\n\nThese JavaScript examples illustrate the high-level logic described in the paper.  A full implementation would involve more intricate details like environment interaction, visual processing using libraries like TensorFlow.js, and robust communication mechanisms between agents.  However, these examples demonstrate how the theoretical concepts of CaPo can be mapped into a practical JavaScript development context for building LLM-based multi-agent applications.",
