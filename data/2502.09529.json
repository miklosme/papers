  "title": "Exact Leader Estimation: A New Approach for Distributed Differentiation",
  "abstract": "A novel strategy aimed at cooperatively differentiating a signal among multiple interacting agents is introduced, where none of the agents needs to know which agent is the leader, i.e. the one producing the signal to be differentiated. Every agent communicates only a scalar variable to its neighbors; except for the leader, all agents execute the same algorithm. The proposed strategy can effectively obtain derivatives up to arbitrary m-th order in a finite time under the assumption that the (m + 1)-th derivative is bounded. The strategy borrows some of its structure from the celebrated homogeneous robust exact differentiator by A. Levant, inheriting its exact differentiation capability and robustness to measurement noise. Hence, the proposed strategy can be said to perform robust exact distributed differentiation. In addition, and for the first time in the distributed leader-observer literature, sampled-data communication and bounded measurement noise are considered, and corresponding steady-state worst-case accuracy bounds are derived. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified numerically for second- and fourth-order systems, i.e., for estimating derivatives of up to first and third order, respectively.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces a novel algorithm for distributed differentiation in multi-agent systems.  Agents estimate the state (position and higher-order derivatives) of a leader agent without needing to know which agent is the leader or the leader's input, relying only on communication with neighbors.  The algorithm is robust to noisy and sampled measurements, providing accurate estimations even with imperfect data. This robustness is directly relevant to LLM-based multi-agent systems, where agent communication can be unreliable or delayed, and internal representations of world state are inherently noisy. The ability to estimate leader state in a distributed, robust manner is crucial for coordination in such systems.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents a novel approach to distributed differentiation in multi-agent systems, particularly relevant for LLM-based agents interacting in a web environment. Let's explore how JavaScript developers can leverage these insights:\n\n**1. Collaborative Content Creation and Editing:**\n\nImagine building a collaborative writing platform where multiple LLM agents assist users in real-time.  Each agent could focus on a specific aspect (grammar, style, fact-checking). The paper's distributed differentiation algorithm can be used to synchronize the agents' understanding of the evolving document, allowing them to work together seamlessly without explicit coordination or knowledge of a \"leader\" agent.  For instance, if one agent proposes a significant change in the document structure, other agents can quickly \"differentiate\" their understanding of the document state and adapt their suggestions accordingly.\n\n* **Implementation Example:**  Using a framework like Socket.IO or Yjs for real-time communication, each agent (represented by a JavaScript object) would maintain a local representation of the document state. A simplified version of the distributed differentiator algorithm could be implemented using numerical JavaScript libraries like NumJs or Math.js to calculate the state updates described in equation (1) of the paper. The scalar output (x<sub>i,0</sub>) could represent a compressed numerical summary of the agent's local document state, exchanged with neighboring agents.\n\n**2. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) on the Web:**\n\nLLM-based agents can participate in DAOs, automating tasks and facilitating decision-making.  The distributed differentiator could enable agents to track and understand the evolving state of the DAO (e.g., treasury balance, proposals, voting patterns) without relying on a central authority.  This ensures robustness and resilience, even if some agents become unavailable.\n\n* **Implementation Example:**  A DAO's on-chain state could be represented by a set of numerical variables.  LLM agents, interacting via a web3 library like ethers.js or web3.js, would maintain a local copy of these variables and use the distributed differentiation algorithm to synchronize with changes on the blockchain.  The scalar output (x<sub>i,0</sub>) could be a hash or summary of the agent's local state.\n\n**3. Multi-Agent Simulation and Modeling in the Browser:**\n\nWeb developers can create browser-based simulations of multi-agent systems, e.g., for modeling complex systems like traffic flow or market dynamics.  The distributed differentiator enables individual agents to estimate global properties of the simulation without requiring central control or extensive communication.\n\n* **Implementation Example:**  Using a JavaScript game engine like Phaser or PixiJS, each agent (a game object) would represent an entity in the simulation.  The algorithm would allow agents to estimate global properties (e.g., average speed of vehicles in a traffic simulation) by exchanging only a scalar value with neighboring agents. This reduces the computational and communication overhead, enabling more complex and scalable simulations in the browser.\n\n**4.  Adaptive User Interfaces Driven by Multi-Agent Systems:**\n\nLLM-based agents can power adaptive user interfaces that personalize content and functionality based on user behavior. The distributed differentiator enables agents to collectively understand the user's evolving needs and preferences without relying on a single, centralized agent.\n\n* **Implementation Example:**  Different agents could specialize in understanding different aspects of user interaction (e.g., browsing history, current task, emotional state). They would exchange scalar summaries of their understanding using the distributed differentiator.  This shared understanding would then inform UI adjustments, ensuring a cohesive and personalized user experience. React or Vue.js could be used to manage the dynamic UI updates.\n\n**Key JavaScript Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Libraries:**  Use robust JavaScript numerical libraries (NumJs, Math.js) to handle the calculations involved in the distributed differentiation algorithm.\n* **Real-time Communication:** Leverage libraries like Socket.IO or Yjs to facilitate the exchange of scalar values between agents in a web environment.\n* **LLM Integration:** Integrate with cloud-based LLM services through their respective JavaScript APIs.\n* **Visualization:** Utilize libraries like D3.js or Chart.js to visualize the behavior and convergence of the multi-agent system in real time.\n\nBy applying these principles and leveraging the appropriate JavaScript tools, developers can explore the exciting potential of multi-agent AI systems within web development, building more collaborative, resilient, and adaptive web applications.",
  "pseudocode": "The paper describes a distributed differentiation algorithm for multi-agent systems. The core algorithm, presented in equation (1), can be translated to JavaScript as follows:\n\n```javascript\nclass Agent {\n  constructor(id, neighbors, hasLeaderAccess, m, L, kValues) {\n    this.id = id;\n    this.neighbors = neighbors;\n    this.hasLeaderAccess = hasLeaderAccess;\n    this.m = m; // Order of differentiation\n    this.L = L; // Bound of (m+1)th derivative of leader's output\n    this.kValues = kValues; // Array of k gains\n    this.x = Array(m + 1).fill(0); // State variables, initialized to 0\n  }\n\n  update(leaderOutput, neighborOutputs) {\n    let b = this.hasLeaderAccess ? 1 : 0;\n    let nextX = Array(this.m + 1);\n\n    for (let mu = 0; mu < this.m; mu++) {\n      let sum = 0;\n      for (let neighborId of this.neighbors) {\n        sum += this.x[0] - neighborOutputs[neighborId];\n      }\n      nextX[mu] = this.x[mu + 1] - this.kValues[mu] * Math.pow(this.L, (this.m - mu) / (m+1)) * Math.pow(Math.abs(sum + b*(this.x[0] - leaderOutput)), (mu+1)/(m+1)) * Math.sign(sum+b*(this.x[0] - leaderOutput));\n\n    }\n    let sum = 0;\n    for (let neighborId of this.neighbors) {\n        sum += this.x[0] - neighborOutputs[neighborId];\n      }\n\n    nextX[this.m] = -this.kValues[this.m] * Math.pow(this.L, 0/(m+1)) * Math.pow(Math.abs(sum + b*(this.x[0] - leaderOutput)), 0/(m+1)) * Math.sign(sum+b*(this.x[0] - leaderOutput));\n\n\n    this.x = nextX;\n  }\n\n  getOutput() {\n    return this.x[0];\n  }\n\n   getDerivative(mu)\n   {\n      return this.x[mu];\n   }\n}\n\n\n\n\n// Example Usage:\nconst numAgents = 4;\nconst m = 1; //differentiation order\nconst L = 0.25 // bound for u''(t) for a sine wave with omega = 0.5\nconst kValues = [2, 1.1];\n\n\n// Define network topology (example: a ring)\nconst neighbors = [];\nfor (let i = 0; i < numAgents; i++) {\n    neighbors[i] = [];\n    neighbors[i].push((i+1)%numAgents);\n    neighbors[i].push((i + numAgents - 1) % numAgents);\n\n}\n\n// Create agents (assume agent 0 has leader access)\nconst agents = [];\nfor (let i = 0; i < numAgents; i++) {\n  agents.push(new Agent(i, neighbors[i], i === 0, m, L,kValues));\n}\n\n// Simulation loop (example)\nconst numSteps = 100;\nconst leaderOutputValues = []\nfor (let step = 0; step < numSteps; step++)\n{\n  leaderOutputValues.push(Math.sin(0.5 * step));\n}\n\nfor (let step = 0; step < numSteps; step++) {\n\n  const neighborOutputs = {}; //object, key = agentID, value = xi0 value\n  for (const agent of agents)\n  {\n     neighborOutputs[agent.id] = agent.getOutput();\n\n  }\n\n\n  for (const agent of agents) {\n\n    agent.update(leaderOutputValues[step], neighborOutputs);\n    console.log(`Agent ${agent.id} x0: ${agent.getDerivative(0)}, x1: ${agent.getDerivative(1)}`);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n**Explanation and Purpose:**\n\nThis algorithm aims to estimate the leader's output signal and its derivatives in a distributed manner.  Each agent in the network maintains an internal state (`this.x`) representing its estimates of the leader's signal and its derivatives up to order *m*.  The algorithm proceeds in discrete time steps.  In each step, agents exchange their estimates of the leader's signal (`x[0]`) with their neighbors. Agents then update their internal state based on the received information and, if applicable, the actual leader output (if they have direct access).\n\nThe `update()` method performs the core computation as described by equation (1). It calculates the next state values based on the current state, the leader's output (or noisy version thereof), and the neighbors' output. The gains *k<sub>µ</sub>* are crucial tuning parameters that influence the convergence rate and robustness.\n\nThe key aspect is the distributed nature: no single agent has complete information, yet by local communication and computation, they collectively converge to accurate estimates of the leader's signal and its derivatives. This is valuable in scenarios where direct communication with the leader is not always feasible.\n\n\nA sampled-data implementation is also provided in equation (11), and a JavaScript version is provided in the previous response. The main difference is that instead of assuming continuous access to neighbor information, information is exchanged only at discrete time instants *kΔ*, which makes it more practical in scenarios involving network communication.",
