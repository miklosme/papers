  "title": "Human Implicit Preference-Based Policy Fine-tuning for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in USV Swarm",
  "abstract": "Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has shown promise in solving complex problems involving cooperation and competition among agents, such as an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) swarm used in search and rescue, surveillance, and vessel protection. However, aligning system behavior with user preferences is challenging due to the difficulty of encoding expert intuition into reward functions. To address the issue, we propose a Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) approach for MARL that resolves credit-assignment challenges through an Agent-Level Feedback system categorizing feedback into intra-agent, inter-agent, and intra-team types. To overcome the challenges of direct human feedback, we employ a Large Language Model (LLM) evaluator to validate our approach using feedback scenarios such as region constraints, collision avoidance, and task allocation. Our method effectively refines USV swarm policies, addressing key challenges in multi-agent systems while maintaining fairness and performance consistency.",
  "summary": "This research introduces a new method for incorporating human feedback into the training of multi-agent AI systems, particularly for scenarios like controlling a swarm of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs).  It addresses the challenge of aligning AI behavior with nuanced human preferences that are difficult to encode in traditional reward functions.  The key innovation is *Agent-Level Feedback*, which allows humans to provide feedback on individual agents' performance, rather than just the overall team. This granular feedback is then used to train a reward model, enabling the AI system to learn and adapt to human preferences more effectively. The system uses an LLM as an evaluator, simulating diverse feedback scenarios like avoiding collisions and allocating tasks.  This approach allows for more complex and nuanced control of multi-agent systems, closer to human decision-making, and demonstrates the practical value of combining LLMs with multi-agent reinforcement learning.",
  "takeaways": "This paper introduces a valuable concept for JavaScript developers working with LLM-powered multi-agent systems: **Agent-Level Feedback**, which enhances preference alignment in complex multi-agent scenarios. Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights:\n\n**1. Scenario: Collaborative Web Design Tool**\n\nImagine building a collaborative design tool where multiple LLM agents (representing different design aspects like layout, color palette, typography) work together to generate website mockups. Initially, the agents might generate designs based on basic principles, but aligning with the user's subtle preferences is crucial.\n\n* **Agent-Level Feedback Implementation:**\n    * **Frontend (React, Vue.js, etc.):** Implement a user interface enabling users to provide feedback on individual agent actions. For example, users could rate the \"Layout Agent's\" suggested layout or the \"Color Palette Agent's\" chosen colors on a scale of \"good\" to \"poor,\" or provide free-text feedback processed by another LLM.\n    * **Backend (Node.js):** Store the trajectory data for each agent (their actions and the resulting design elements).  When feedback is received, associate it with the corresponding agent and timestep in the trajectory. Use this data to train an agent-wise reward model. You can represent the agents' actions and design elements as JSON objects and use a JavaScript library like TensorFlow.js or Brain.js for building and training the reward model.  The Bradley-Terry model from the paper could be implemented with a custom JavaScript function.\n    * **LLM Integration:** Use an LLM API (like OpenAI) within the backend to process the free-text feedback, categorize it (intra-agent, inter-agent, intra-team), and translate it into quantitative scores for the reward model.\n    * **Fine-tuning:** Update the LLM agents' prompting or fine-tune their underlying models using the learned reward function. Libraries like LangChain can be used for managing the prompting and interaction with the LLMs.\n\n**2. Scenario: Multi-Agent Chatbot for Customer Support**\n\nConsider a customer support system with multiple specialized LLM agents: \"Order Agent,\" \"Technical Support Agent,\" and \"Billing Agent.\" The goal is to seamlessly hand off conversations between agents based on customer queries.\n\n* **Agent-Level Feedback Implementation:**\n    * **Frontend (React):**  Allow users to rate each agent's performance individually (e.g., helpfulness, relevance, clarity) after a support interaction.\n    * **Backend (Node.js):** Record the conversation history as trajectory data, including agent utterances, user responses, and handover decisions.  Use user feedback to train a reward model, associating feedback with specific agent actions within the conversation.\n    * **LLM Integration:** Employ an LLM to analyze conversation flow and agent contributions.  The LLM can assist in attributing credit or blame in cases of complex interactions, aiding in more accurate agent-level feedback.\n    * **Fine-tuning:** Use the learned rewards to refine the agent handover policy and individual agent responses, improving overall customer experience.\n\n**3. Libraries and Frameworks**\n\n* **Frontend:** React, Vue.js, Angular for UI and user interaction.\n* **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js or similar frameworks.\n* **LLM Integration:** LangChain, OpenAI's API, or other LLM providers' libraries.\n* **Reward Modeling:** TensorFlow.js, Brain.js for creating and training the reward model.\n\n**Key JavaScript Considerations:**\n\n* **Asynchronous operations:** Handling feedback and LLM interactions asynchronously is crucial for maintaining responsiveness. Promises and async/await are key tools here.\n* **Data structures:** Efficient storage and retrieval of trajectory data and feedback are important. Consider using IndexedDB or other database solutions for large datasets.\n* **Performance optimization:** LLM interactions can be computationally expensive. Optimize your code and consider caching for frequently used queries.\n\nBy incorporating Agent-Level Feedback, JavaScript developers can build more user-centric and adaptable multi-agent systems for the web, blurring the lines between artificial intelligence and human intuition. This approach allows LLMs to learn subtle user preferences efficiently and paves the way for a new generation of intelligent web applications.",
