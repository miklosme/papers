  "title": "Foragax: An Agent Based Modelling framework based on JAX",
  "abstract": "Foraging for resources is a ubiquitous activity conducted by living organisms in a shared environment to maintain their homeostasis. Modelling multi-agent foraging in-silico allows us to study both individual and collective emergent behaviour in a tractable manner. Agent-based modelling has proven to be effective in simulating such tasks, though scaling the simulations to accommodate large numbers of agents with complex dynamics remains challenging. In this work, we present Foragax, a general-purpose, scalable, hardware-accelerated, multi-agent foraging toolkit. Leveraging the JAX library, our toolkit can simulate thousands of agents foraging in a common environment, in an end-to-end vectorized and differentiable manner. The toolkit provides agent-based modelling tools to model various foraging tasks, including options to design custom spatial and temporal agent dynamics, control policies, sensor models, and boundary conditions. Further, the number of agents during such simulations can be increased or decreased based on custom rules. The toolkit can also be used to potentially model more general multi-agent scenarios.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces Foragax, a Python toolkit built on Google's JAX library for simulating large-scale multi-agent foraging behaviors. Foragax allows researchers to model agents with custom behaviors and policies, making it relevant to LLM-based multi-agent systems. \n\nKey takeaways for LLM systems: \n\n* **Scalability:** Simulates thousands of agents concurrently thanks to JAX's parallel processing, surpassing typical limitations.\n* **Customizable:** Model agents with diverse policies, which could be driven by LLMs to enable complex decision-making. \n* **Open-ended tasks:** Focuses on continuous, non-episodic simulations, suitable for studying emergent behavior in LLM-agents over time. \n* **Potential for LLM integration:** While current examples use simpler neural networks, Foragax's structure allows for plugging in LLM-based policies for agents, opening up research opportunities in complex, long-term multi-agent interactions.",
  "takeaways": "While the paper introduces Foragax, a Python-based toolkit using JAX, the core concepts it discusses are transferable to JavaScript and offer exciting possibilities for LLM-powered multi-agent systems on the web. Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights:\n\n**1. Simulating Complex Multi-Agent Interactions**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine building a collaborative web app where AI agents, powered by LLMs, interact in a shared environment like a virtual world or a collaborative document editor.\n* **Application:**\n    * **Agent Design (JavaScript):** Represent agents as JavaScript objects with properties like position, goals, and internal LLM state. Use libraries like TensorFlow.js or Brain.js to implement LLMs within agents.\n    * **Environment Modeling (JavaScript):**  Model the shared environment using Canvas API, WebGL, or libraries like Three.js for 3D environments.\n    * **Agent Communication (WebSockets):**  Enable real-time agent communication and state synchronization using WebSockets or libraries like Socket.IO. \n\n**2. Scalability for Web Environments**\n\n* **Challenge:**  LLM-based agents are computationally intensive. Scaling to many agents in a browser-based environment is crucial.\n* **Solutions:**\n    * **Web Workers (JavaScript):** Offload LLM processing and agent logic to Web Workers for parallel execution, preventing UI freezes.\n    * **Server-Side Support (Node.js):** For highly demanding simulations, use Node.js to run agents server-side and handle communication with browser clients.\n\n**3. Practical JavaScript Implementations**\n\n* **Agent Framework:** Consider using JavaScript-based agent frameworks like:\n    * **Broid** (https://github.com/schematical/broid): For building conversational agents.\n    * **Agent.js** (https://github.com/agentjs/agent):  A more general-purpose agent framework.\n* **LLM Integration:** Integrate cloud-based LLM APIs (OpenAI, Google AI Platform) or use locally run models in TensorFlow.js.\n\n**Example: Collaborative Code Editor**\n\nImagine a code editor where multiple users, each assisted by an LLM agent, work on the same codebase:\n\n```javascript\n// Simplified representation\nconst agent = {\n  id: 'agent-1',\n  position: { line: 10, col: 5 },  // Cursor position in code\n  llm: new TensorFlowJSModel('//path/to/llm/model.json'), \n  // ... other properties\n  act(state) { \n    // Use LLM to suggest code, refactor, etc.\n  } \n};\n```\n\n* **Collaboration:** Agents could use a shared WebSocket channel to broadcast changes, intentions, or even engage in code review discussions through the LLM.\n* **Visualization:** The editor interface could visually represent other agents' positions, maybe highlighting areas of code being actively worked on.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n* **Foragax's principles, though implemented in Python, are transferable to JavaScript for building LLM-powered multi-agent web apps.**\n* **Leveraging JavaScript's concurrency, web technologies, and LLM integration opens up new frontiers for interactive and collaborative AI experiences on the web.**",
