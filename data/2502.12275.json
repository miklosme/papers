  "title": "Integrating Expert Knowledge into Logical Programs via LLMs",
  "abstract": "This paper introduces ExKLoP, a novel framework designed to evaluate how effectively Large Language Models (LLMs) integrate expert knowledge into logical reasoning systems. This capability is especially valuable in engineering, where expert knowledge—such as manufacturer-recommended operational ranges—can be directly embedded into automated monitoring systems. By mirroring expert verification steps, tasks like range checking and constraint validation help ensure system safety and reliability. Our approach systematically evaluates LLM-generated logical rules, assessing both syntactic fluency and logical correctness in these critical validation tasks. We also explore the models' capacity for self-correction via an iterative feedback loop based on code execution outcomes. ExKLoP presents an extensible dataset comprising 130 engineering premises, 950 prompts, and corresponding validation points. It enables comprehensive benchmarking while allowing control over task complexity and scalability of experiments. We leverage the synthetic data creation methodology to conduct extensive empirical evaluation on a diverse set of LLMs including Llama3, Gemma, Mixtral, Mistral, and Qwen. Results reveal that while models generate nearly perfect syntactically correct code, they frequently exhibit logical errors in translating expert knowledge. Furthermore, iterative self-correction yields only marginal improvements (up to 3%). Overall, ExKLoP serves as a robust evaluation platform that streamlines the selection of effective models for self-correcting systems while clearly delineating the types of errors encountered. The complete implementation, along with all relevant data, is available at GitHub.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces ExKLoP, a framework for testing how well Large Language Models (LLMs) can translate human-readable expert knowledge (like engineering rules) into executable Python code and then automatically correct errors in that code.  \n\nWhile LLMs excel at generating syntactically correct code, they often make logical errors. The iterative self-correction abilities of the tested LLMs showed only marginal improvement, suggesting that more sophisticated correction methods like cross-model correction might be necessary for reliable multi-agent systems where the LLM translates expert knowledge into executable actions.  The framework and dataset provide a benchmark for evaluating and improving this critical aspect of LLM-powered knowledge integration for future multi-agent applications.",
  "takeaways": "This paper's insights on integrating expert knowledge into logical programs via LLMs, particularly its focus on validation and iterative refinement, offer valuable lessons for JavaScript developers building LLM-based multi-agent web applications. Here's how:\n\n**1. Multi-Agent Collaboration with Verified Rules:**\n\nImagine a multi-agent e-commerce application where agents handle inventory management, customer service, and dynamic pricing.  Expert-defined rules, such as \"discount cannot exceed 20%\" or \"inventory below threshold triggers reorder,\" are crucial.  ExKLoP's methodology translates directly:\n\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**  Define these rules in natural language and use an LLM to translate them into JavaScript functions.  For example:\n\n```javascript\n// Expert rule (natural language)\n// \"If the product category is 'electronics' and the stock is less than 10, trigger a restock request.\"\n\n// JavaScript function (LLM generated, needs validation)\nfunction shouldRestock(category, stock) {\n  if (category === 'electronics' and stock < 10) {\n      return true;\n  } else {\n      return false;\n  }\n}\n\n```\n* **Validation Framework (ExKLoP inspired):** Create a test suite using a library like Jest or Mocha. Include both unit tests (individual rule functions) and integration tests (agent interactions based on rules). Generate test cases systematically, covering boundary conditions (stock = 9, stock = 10, stock = 11) and various categories, inspired by ExKLoP’s dataset generation.\n* **Iterative Refinement:** Log errors and failures during testing. Feed the error messages and the problematic JavaScript function back to the LLM for refinement. Utilize a prompt structure similar to ExKLoP to guide the LLM, making the feedback as structured as possible.  Loop until tests pass.\n* **Agent Framework:** Integrate validated rule functions into your agent framework. Libraries like Langchain.js or a custom implementation using Node.js with message passing can serve as the foundation.\n\n\n**2. Client-Side Validation in Multi-Agent Forms:**\n\nConsider a complex web form for insurance applications, handled by multiple agents (e.g., one for personal information, one for policy details, and one for risk assessment).  Each agent needs to validate its part of the form based on expert rules. ExKLoP’s findings can be applied here:\n\n* **LLM-Generated Validation Logic:** Define expert rules for each field (e.g., \"age must be between 18 and 65\" or \"income must be positive\").  Use an LLM to generate JavaScript validation functions for each agent. These functions could be embedded directly in the frontend using a framework like React or Vue.js.\n* **Real-time Validation:** Trigger validation on field changes. Provide immediate feedback to the user, highlighting errors based on the LLM-generated logic.\n* **Dynamic Form Updates (Advanced):** Based on user input, agents can dynamically update the form fields and validation logic using LLM-generated code, subject to ExKLoP-style validation before application. For example, selecting \"student\" as occupation could trigger an agent to generate and validate new rules about student discounts and eligibility.\n\n**3. Visualizing Agent Reasoning with Validated Rules:**\n\nExKLoP highlights the importance of transparent and verifiable logic.  In web development, visualization can play a key role.\n\n* **Rule Visualization Library:**  Use a JavaScript graph visualization library like D3.js or Vis.js to display the LLM-generated rule dependency graph. This helps developers and potentially even end-users understand how agents are making decisions.\n* **Step-by-Step Reasoning Display:** When an agent makes a decision, visualize the steps involved by highlighting the rules that were triggered and their outcomes, thus providing clear insight into the reasoning process and enhancing trust and debuggability.\n\n**Key Takeaways for JavaScript Developers:**\n\n* **Validation is paramount:**  LLM-generated code, especially logical rules, needs rigorous validation using automated testing and diverse datasets.\n* **Iterative refinement is key:**  LLMs are not perfect. Implement feedback loops to refine LLM-generated code based on errors and failures.\n* **Structured Feedback:**  Provide specific error messages and context to the LLM for effective self-correction. Mimic ExKLoP's feedback mechanisms.\n* **Think Beyond Server-Side:**  LLMs can enhance client-side logic and validation in multi-agent web apps, improving user experience and application integrity.\n\nBy incorporating the validation and refinement principles of ExKLoP, JavaScript developers can build more robust, reliable, and transparent LLM-based multi-agent systems for the web. This approach fosters trust in LLM-generated code and unlocks the full potential of multi-agent AI in web development.",
  "pseudocode": "The paper contains several snippets of Python code that represent logical rules. These are functionally equivalent to pseudocode and can be translated to JavaScript.\n\n**1. Range Checking (Task 1)**\n\nPython:\n\n```python\ndef r1(a: float) -> bool:\n    return 20 <= a <= 110\n```\n\nJavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfunction r1(a) {\n  return a >= 20 && a <= 110;\n}\n```\n\n*Explanation:* This function checks if a given value `a` falls within the range of 20 to 110 (inclusive). Its purpose is to validate a single parameter against a specified range.  This is a core component of Task 1, which focuses on evaluating the LLM's ability to generate code that checks if parameter values are within predefined acceptable bounds.\n\n\n**2. Constraint Validation (Task 2)**\n\nPython:\n\n```python\ndef r1(e: float, f: float) -> bool:\n    if e >= f:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n```\n\nJavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfunction r1(e, f) {\n  return e >= f;\n}\n```\n\n*Explanation:* This function checks if the value of parameter `e` is greater than or equal to the value of parameter `f`. This illustrates the interdependencies between parameters in Task 2, where the LLM must generate code to validate relationships *between* parameters, not just individual parameter values against a fixed range.\n\n\n**3. Multi-parameter Constraint and Combined Logic**\n\nPython (Task 2 logic combining multiple rules r1, r2):\n\n```python\ndef r3(arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4, arg5, arg6):\n    return not(r1(arg1, arg2) and r2(arg3, arg4, arg5, arg6)), r1(arg1, arg2), r2(arg3, arg4, arg5, arg6)\n```\n\nJavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfunction r3(arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4, arg5, arg6) {\n  const rule1Result = r1(arg1, arg2);\n  const rule2Result = r2(arg3, arg4, arg5, arg6);\n  return ! (rule1Result && rule2Result); // Return the combined logical result. Note:  The Python example also returns the individual rule results, but the paper's focus is on the combined logic. \n}\n\n\n// Example definition for r2 (needs to be defined based on the specific constraint in the prompt)\nfunction r2(arg3, arg4, arg5, arg6) {\n  //  Example: Check if arg3 is less than the sum of the others\n  return arg3 < (arg4 + arg5 + arg6);\n}\n\n```\n\n*Explanation:* This function combines the results of multiple constraint validation functions (like `r1` and `r2`) using a logical `NOT` and `AND` operation. This snippet is especially relevant as it represents the final, combined logic that the LLM should generate to incorporate all individual constraints described in the prompt for Task 2. This is a crucial component in evaluating more complex rule generation.\n\nThese examples showcase how the logical constraints presented in the paper can be expressed in JavaScript, facilitating practical experimentation for JavaScript developers interested in implementing similar LLM-driven multi-agent logic in web applications.  The paper's core focus is the LLM's capacity to correctly *generate* this type of logic, given a natural language prompt describing the rules.  The JavaScript translations provide a readily usable form for developers to work with and to understand the underlying principles and structure of the logic the LLM is expected to produce.",
