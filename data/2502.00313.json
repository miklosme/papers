  "title": "Distributive Fairness in Large Language Models: Evaluating Alignment with Human Values",
  "abstract": "The growing interest in employing large language models (LLMs) for decision-making in social and economic contexts has raised questions about their potential to function as agents in these domains. A significant number of societal problems involve the distribution of resources, where fairness, along with economic efficiency, play a critical role in the desirability of outcomes. In this paper, we examine whether LLM responses adhere to fundamental fairness concepts such as equitability, envy-freeness, and Rawlsian maximin, and investigate their alignment with human preferences. We evaluate the performance of several LLMs, providing a comparative benchmark of their ability to reflect these measures. Our results demonstrate a lack of alignment between current LLM responses and human distributional preferences. Moreover, LLMs are unable to utilize money as a transferable resource to mitigate inequality. Nonetheless, we demonstrate a stark contrast when (some) LLMs are tasked with selecting from a predefined menu of options rather than generating one. In addition, we analyze the robustness of LLM responses to variations in semantic factors (e.g. intentions or personas) or non-semantic prompting changes (e.g. templates or orderings). Finally, we highlight potential strategies aimed at enhancing the alignment of LLM behavior with well-established fairness concepts.",
  "summary": "This paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can make fair decisions when allocating resources among multiple individuals, comparing LLM behavior with human choices.  It focuses on fairness concepts like equitability (equal outcomes), envy-freeness (no one prefers another's allocation), and maximizing the minimum payoff (helping the worst-off).\n\n\nKey findings relevant to LLM-based multi-agent systems are: LLMs struggle to prioritize fairness, often favoring efficiency (maximizing total value) even when leading to unequal outcomes. They are better at selecting fair solutions from a given set of options than generating them independently.  LLMs don't effectively use transferable resources (like money) to improve fairness, unlike humans.  Their behavior can be influenced by instructions, assigned \"personas\" (like focusing on a specific fairness notion), and biases, but assigning personas doesn't consistently improve fairness.  LLMs are also sensitive to how the problem is presented, such as the order of goods or wording in the prompt.",
  "takeaways": "This paper highlights the misalignment between current LLMs and human values regarding fairness in resource allocation, a crucial aspect for multi-agent web applications. Here's how JavaScript developers can apply these insights to LLM-based multi-agent AI projects:\n\n**1. Implementing Fairness Constraints:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Building a collaborative task management app where an LLM agent assigns tasks to multiple users.\n* **Insight:** LLMs tend to prioritize efficiency (e.g., assigning tasks based on individual skill levels) over fairness (e.g., equal workload distribution).\n* **Implementation:**\n    * Use LangChain or a similar framework to interact with the LLM.\n    * Define fairness metrics in JavaScript (e.g., Gini coefficient for workload, maximum difference in task complexity).\n    * Incorporate these metrics as constraints in the LLM prompt or use reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to train the agent to prioritize fairness.  For example, a prompt could be structured as \"Assign tasks to minimize the Gini coefficient of workload, ensuring each user receives a similar number of tasks with equivalent complexity\".\n    * Visualize fairness metrics in the app's UI using D3.js or Chart.js.  This will provide transparency and user feedback opportunities.\n\n**2. Mitigating Inequality with Virtual Resources:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Developing a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governed by LLM agents that allocate governance tokens.\n* **Insight:** The paper shows that LLMs struggle to leverage money effectively to mitigate inequality.  However,  a DAO can use virtual resources.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * Design a mechanism in your smart contract (using Solidity/Web3.js) that allows the LLM agent to adjust token allocations based on fairness metrics.\n    * Implement a virtual currency or reputation system to compensate members for unequal contributions or reward fairness-promoting actions, using rules programmed in JavaScript and integrated into the front-end UI using React or Vue.js.\n\n**3. Menu-Based Decision Making:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Creating a meeting scheduling tool using LLM agents that suggest optimal time slots for multiple participants.\n* **Insight:** LLMs show improved fairness considerations when choosing from a set of predefined options.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * Pre-generate a set of potential meeting schedules considering various fairness criteria (e.g., minimizing the maximum travel time for participants).\n    * Use the LLM to rank these schedules according to predefined fairness criteria, or offer a select set for user choice, using a JavaScript framework like React to manage user interactions and dynamic UI updates.\n\n**4.  Addressing Cognitive Biases:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  An LLM agent recommends products in an e-commerce app, serving as a virtual shopping assistant.\n* **Insight:**  LLMs can exhibit biases, especially when assigned a role that gives them a stake in the outcome (e.g., receiving rewards for successful upselling).\n* **Implementation:**\n    * Be explicit about user needs in the LLM prompt and prioritize user feedback on the LLM's recommendations.\n    * Implement auditing mechanisms in JavaScript to monitor the LLM's behavior and detect potential biases (e.g., disproportionately recommending high-margin products).  \n    * Consider using multiple LLM agents with different personas to generate diverse recommendations and reduce bias through aggregation, using Node.js for backend processing.\n\n**5.  Prompt Engineering for Fairness:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  Building a chat application where LLM agents moderate user interactions and flag harmful content.\n* **Insight:**  Prompt engineering is crucial for eliciting fairness-conscious behavior from LLMs.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * Include explicit instructions about the desired fairness criteria in the LLM prompt, using specific examples to illustrate fair and unfair moderation decisions. Consider CoT prompts to clarify LLM's reasoning process.  \n    * Experiment with different prompt templates and orderings using LangChain's prompt templates and output parsers to reduce any bias introduced by prompt structure.\n    * Continuously evaluate and refine your prompts based on user feedback, using A/B testing to compare different prompt versions and track user satisfaction.\n\nBy incorporating these insights and techniques, JavaScript developers can build multi-agent web applications that are not only efficient but also fair and aligned with human values.  This careful approach is essential for fostering trust and ensuring equitable outcomes in the increasingly complex world of LLM-powered web applications.",
