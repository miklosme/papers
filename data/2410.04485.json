  "title": "Exploring the Potential of Conversational Test Suite Based Program Repair on SWE-bench",
  "abstract": "Automatic program repair at project level may open yet to be seen opportunities in various fields of human activity. Since the SWE-Bench challenge was presented, we have seen numerous of solutions. Patch generation is a part of program repair, and test suite-based conversational patch generation has proven its effectiveness. However, the potential of conversational patch generation has not yet specifically estimated on SWE-Bench. This study reports experimental results aimed at evaluating the individual effectiveness of conversational patch generation on problems from SWE-Bench. The experiments show that a simple conversational pipeline based on LLAMA 3.1 70B can generate valid patches in 47% of cases, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art in program repair on SWE-Bench.",
  "summary": "This paper studies how well a conversational AI system can fix software bugs (specifically on the SWE-Bench benchmark).  \n\n* Using either LLAMA or GPT-4, they tested giving the AI a conversational \"back-and-forth\" where it received feedback on whether code changes passed tests.\n* This conversational approach, while simple, generated working patches more often than just repeatedly asking for a fix *without* feedback. \n* This suggests that even basic multi-agent interaction (AI agent + testing environment) is promising for program repair tasks.",
  "takeaways": "This paper explores the potential of conversational, test-driven program repair using LLMs, showing promising results even with a simple implementation. While written for Python, its insights directly apply to JavaScript developers building LLM-powered multi-agent systems for the web. Here's how:\n\n**1. Building smarter agents for code collaboration:**\n\n* Imagine a multi-agent web app where developers collaborate on code with AI assistance. One agent could be responsible for suggesting code changes, while another focuses on writing unit tests. By integrating the paper's \"conversational repair\" approach:\n    * The code-generating agent, powered by an LLM like GPT-4, proposes code modifications.\n    * The testing agent runs the updated tests and provides feedback to the LLM in a structured format (similar to the paper's MSGC message), highlighting errors and failures.\n    * This feedback loop continues iteratively, refining the code until all tests pass.\n\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * **LLM Integration:** Use libraries like `langchain.js` to connect to LLMs for code generation.\n    * **Testing Frameworks:** Leverage frameworks like Jest or Vitest for running tests and collecting detailed feedback (e.g., failed assertions, stack traces).\n    * **Communication:**  Implement a messaging system (e.g., using WebSockets or a message queue) for real-time communication between agents.\n\n**2. Self-healing web applications:**\n\n*  The paper's concept can be extended to create \"self-healing\" web applications.  Consider an e-commerce site facing a JavaScript error on its checkout page:\n    * A monitoring agent detects the error and isolates the problematic code section.\n    * It sends this information (code snippet + error details) to an LLM-powered repair agent.\n    * The repair agent iteratively suggests fixes, receives feedback from a testing agent running browser-based tests (e.g., using Puppeteer or Playwright), and refines the code.\n    * Once a successful patch is found, the repair agent deploys it, potentially after human review.\n\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * **Error Monitoring:**  Tools like Sentry or Rollbar can capture JavaScript errors and provide context.\n    * **Code Isolation:** Use source maps to pinpoint the exact code responsible for the error.\n    * **Automated Deployment:** Consider continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines for seamless deployment of tested fixes.\n\n**Key Takeaways for JavaScript Developers:**\n\n* **Iterative Feedback is Crucial:**  Treat LLMs as collaborators, providing clear feedback on code changes using test results. Don't expect perfect code from a single prompt.\n* **Structure Matters:** Design a structured communication protocol between agents, using a format that LLMs can easily understand (e.g., JSON with specific fields for code, errors, and test results).\n* **Experiment and Iterate:**  Start with simple proof-of-concept implementations and gradually increase complexity. There's immense potential for innovation in LLM-powered multi-agent web development.\n\nBy embracing these concepts, JavaScript developers can leverage the power of LLMs to create more robust, intelligent, and collaborative web applications.",
  "pseudocode": "```javascript\nfunction conversationalProgramRepair(s, i, T, M, attempts) {\n  // Initialize chat history with the initial message\n  let H = [getMessageA(s, i)]; \n\n  while (attempts > 1) {\n    // Send the chat history to the LLM and get a response\n    let out = M.chat(H); \n\n    // Try to apply the patch from the LLM response and run tests\n    let res = tryApplyPatchAndRunTests(out, T);\n\n    // Handle the result of the patch application and test run\n    switch (res.type) {\n      case 'SyntaxError':\n        // If there's a syntax error, append a message to the chat history\n        H.push(getMessageB()); \n        break;\n      case 'SemanticError':\n        // If there's a semantic error, append a message with error information\n        H.push(getMessageC(res.err)); \n        break;\n      default:\n        // If all tests pass, break the loop\n        return 'Repaired code!'; \n    }\n\n    // Decrement the attempts counter\n    attempts--; \n  }\n\n  // If attempts are exhausted, return the last version of the code\n  return 'Failed to repair code within allowed attempts.'; \n}\n\n// Hypothetical helper functions \nfunction getMessageA(s, i) { \n  // Constructs the initial message from code snippet (s) and issue description (i)\n  return `You need to fix this issue in the code below:\\n\\n${i}\\n\\n\\`\\`\\`python\\n${s}\\n\\`\\`\\``;\n}\n\nfunction getMessageB() { \n  // Returns a message indicating a syntax error\n  return \"Your code has errors, please fix them.\";\n}\n\nfunction getMessageC(err) { \n  // Returns a message with test failure details\n  return `Tests failed with the following errors:\\n\\n${err}`;\n}\n\nfunction tryApplyPatchAndRunTests(out, T) { \n  // Attempts to extract and apply a code patch from the LLM output\n  // Runs the test suite (T) and returns the result \n  // This is a simplification; in reality, this would involve complex parsing and execution logic\n  if (/* patch application successful and all tests pass */) {\n    return { type: 'Success' };\n  } else if (/* patch application results in a syntax error */) {\n    return { type: 'SyntaxError' };\n  } else {\n    return { type: 'SemanticError', err: 'Test failures...' }; \n  }\n}\n\n// Example usage (hypothetical)\nlet s = `def add(x, y):\\n  return x +`; \nlet i = \"The `add` function is not correctly calculating the sum of two numbers.\";\nlet T = ['test1', 'test2']; \nlet M = { chat: function(history) { /* LLM interaction logic */ } };\nlet attempts = 5;\n\nlet result = conversationalProgramRepair(s, i, T, M, attempts);\nconsole.log(result); \n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe `conversationalProgramRepair` function simulates a conversational program repair process using an LLM.  Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. **Initialization:** It takes the faulty code (`s`), issue description (`i`), test suite (`T`), LLM interface (`M`), and maximum attempts as input. It starts by formatting the initial message using `getMessageA`.\n\n2. **Conversation Loop:** It enters a loop limited by the `attempts` parameter. In each iteration:\n   - It interacts with the LLM (`M.chat`) using the conversation history (`H`).\n   - It attempts to apply the LLM's suggested patch (`tryApplyPatchAndRunTests`).\n   - Based on the patch application and test results, it constructs appropriate feedback messages (`getMessageB`, `getMessageC`) and appends them to the conversation history (`H`) to guide the LLM in the next iteration.\n\n3. **Termination:** The loop continues until:\n   - A successful repair is achieved (all tests pass).\n   - The maximum number of attempts is reached.\n\n**Purpose:**\n\nThis code demonstrates the concept of using LLMs for conversational program repair. It showcases the iterative feedback loop between the developer (simulated here by the code) and the LLM, where test results refine the LLM's understanding of the problem and its proposed solutions. \n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n- The helper functions (`getMessageA`, `getMessageB`, `getMessageC`, `tryApplyPatchAndRunTests`) are simplified for illustrative purposes. In a real-world implementation, these would involve more complex logic for natural language processing, code parsing, patch application, and test execution.\n- The LLM interaction (`M.chat`) is abstracted. In reality, this would involve interacting with an LLM API. \n\nThis example aims to provide a high-level understanding of how conversational program repair might work in a JavaScript context. Real-world implementations would require more sophisticated code and integration with LLM services.",
