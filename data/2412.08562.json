  "title": "An End-to-End Collaborative Learning Approach for Connected Autonomous Vehicles in Occluded Scenarios",
  "abstract": "Abstract-Collaborative navigation becomes essential in situations of occluded scenarios in autonomous driving where independent driving policies are likely to lead to collisions. One promising approach to address this issue is through the use of Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) networks that allow for the sharing of perception information with nearby agents, preventing catastrophic accidents. In this article, we propose a collaborative control method based on a V2V network for sharing compressed LiDAR features and employing Proximal Policy Optimisation to train safe and efficient navigation policies. Unlike previous approaches that rely on expert data (behaviour cloning), our proposed approach learns the multi-agent policies directly from experience in the occluded environment, while effectively meeting bandwidth limitations. The proposed method first prepossesses LiDAR point cloud data to obtain meaningful features through a convolutional neural network and then shares them with nearby CAVs to alert for potentially dangerous situations. To evaluate the proposed method, we developed an occluded intersection gym environment based on the CARLA autonomous driving simulator, allowing real-time data sharing among agents. Our experimental results demonstrate the consistent superiority of our collaborative control method over an independent reinforcement learning method and a cooperative early fusion method.",
  "summary": "This paper proposes a collaborative method for autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to navigate safely through occluded intersections (like blind corners or summits).  Instead of relying on pre-programmed rules or individual learning, CAVs share compressed LiDAR data via a V2V network.  This shared information helps each vehicle understand the overall scene better and make smarter decisions, even when other vehicles are hidden from direct view.\n\nKey points for LLM-based multi-agent systems:\n\n* **Decentralized Perception:** Each agent (CAV) builds its own understanding of the environment based on local sensor data and information received from its neighbors.\n* **Compressed Communication:**  Agents share compressed representations of their sensor data (LiDAR features), crucial for bandwidth efficiency in real-world applications.\n* **Collaborative Learning:** Agents learn to cooperate through Multi-agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO), a reinforcement learning technique that enables decentralized decision-making while leveraging centralized training.\n* **Resilience to Noise:** The system shows robustness against sensor noise and data dropout, essential for real-world deployment.",
  "takeaways": "This paper offers valuable insights for JavaScript developers working with LLM-based multi-agent applications, particularly in collaborative scenarios requiring real-time interaction, like multi-user web-based games, collaborative design tools, or decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).\n\nHere are some practical examples of how JavaScript developers can apply these insights:\n\n**1. Collaborative Perception with Compressed LiDAR-like Data:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine a multi-user online game where agents (controlled by LLMs) navigate a virtual environment. Instead of sharing raw perception data (like the entire game state), each agent could generate a compressed summary of its local surroundings, mimicking the LiDAR data compression approach in the paper.\n* **Implementation:**  \n    * Use a library like TensorFlow.js to implement a small convolutional neural network (CNN) client-side. This CNN processes the agent's local view (e.g., a grid representation of nearby objects) and produces a compact feature vector.\n    * Use a compression algorithm (e.g., a simplified version inspired by Draco, adapted for 2D data if applicable) to further reduce the size of the feature vector.\n    * Share these compressed summaries via WebSockets or a peer-to-peer library like PeerJS. \n    * On the receiving end, reconstruct a simplified version of the sender's perception, enriching the receiver's overall understanding of the environment without the bandwidth overhead of full state synchronization.\n\n**2. Decentralized Decision-Making with MAPPO:**\n\n* **Scenario:** In a collaborative design tool, multiple LLMs could work together to generate design variations. Each LLM acts as an independent agent, proposing design changes based on its current \"perception\" (a vectorized representation of the current design state) and the compressed summaries it receives from other agents.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * Implement a simplified version of MAPPO using TensorFlow.js or a similar library. Each agent has its own actor and critic networks.\n    * Train the agents using a shared reward function that encourages collaborative design choices (e.g., coherence, novelty, feasibility).  \n    * The actions could be design modifications (e.g., adding/removing elements, changing parameters).\n    * During execution (in the user's browser), each agent makes decisions independently based on its local information and the received summaries.\n\n**3. Robustness to Partial Information:**\n\n* **Scenario:** In a DAO, LLM agents could vote on proposals.  The paper's focus on robustness to data loss is relevant here because agents might not always have access to all relevant information due to network issues or deliberate information withholding.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * Train the LLMs with varying levels of information availability, simulating data loss or dropout. This can involve randomly removing or corrupting parts of the input data during training.\n    * Use techniques like dropout regularization in the neural network architecture to improve robustness to missing information.\n    * Explore using Bayesian neural networks to quantify uncertainty in the agent's decision-making process, allowing for more cautious behavior when information is incomplete.\n\n**4. JavaScript Libraries and Frameworks:**\n\n* **TensorFlow.js:**  For implementing neural networks (CNNs, actor-critic networks).\n* **WebSockets or PeerJS:**  For real-time communication between agents.\n* **Three.js or Babylon.js:** For visualizing agent behavior in a 3D environment (if applicable).\n* **LangChain and LlamaIndex:** To enhance LLM capabilities and manage prompts.\n\n\nBy combining these approaches, JavaScript developers can build robust and scalable multi-agent web applications where LLMs can effectively collaborate and make decisions in complex, dynamic environments, even with limited information or bandwidth constraints.  The key takeaway is adapting the principles of compressed perception sharing and decentralized decision-making to the specific constraints and requirements of the web environment.",

Its purpose is to train agents (CAVs) to make cooperative decisions to safely and efficiently navigate intersections where some vehicles might be hidden from the ego vehicle's direct line of sight.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n1. **Initialization:** The algorithm starts by initializing the parameters for the critic network (V), the actor network (π), and the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for LiDAR feature extraction.\n\n2. **Episode Loop:** The main loop iterates through a set number of episodes (M).\n\n3. **Time Step Loop:** Within each episode, another loop iterates through each time step (t).\n\n4. **Vehicle Loop:**  Inside the time step loop, a loop iterates through each CAV (j).\n\n5. **LiDAR Processing:** Each vehicle's LiDAR data is preprocessed, and features are extracted using the CNN.\n\n6. **Compression and Sharing:** These features are compressed using DRACO to reduce bandwidth requirements and then shared via a simulated V2V network.  This part simulates the communication between CAVs. The shared features are then decompressed and transformed into the receiving vehicle's perspective.\n\n7. **Feature Aggregation:** The received LiDAR features are aggregated.\n\n8. **Action Selection and Value Calculation:** Using the aggregated LiDAR features and current state, the actor network (π) selects an action for the vehicle. The critic network (V) estimates the value of the current state.\n\n9. **Environment Interaction:** The selected action is executed in the environment, resulting in a reward and the next state.\n\n10. **Transition Storage:** The current state, action, reward, and next state are stored as a transition.\n\n11. **Advantage and Reward-to-Go Calculation:** After collecting a batch of transitions, the Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) is used to calculate the advantage, and the discounted reward-to-go is computed.\n\n12. **Network Update:**  The critic and actor networks are updated using the calculated advantage and reward-to-go values, typically using an optimizer like Adam.\n\n13. **Repeat:** Steps 4-12 are repeated for each vehicle at each time step, and the entire process is repeated for the defined number of episodes.\n\n\nThis JavaScript adaptation provides a clearer structure, using async/await for environment interactions, and incorporates comments and helper functions for better understanding and implementation. Remember that the helper functions are placeholders and need to be replaced with actual implementations based on your environment and network architectures.",
