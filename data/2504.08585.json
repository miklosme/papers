  "title": "Ready, Bid, Go! On-Demand Delivery Using Fleets of Drones with Unknown, Heterogeneous Energy Storage Constraints",
  "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are expected to transform logistics, reducing delivery time, costs, and emissions. This study addresses an on-demand delivery, in which fleets of UAVs are deployed to fulfil orders that arrive stochastically. Unlike previous work, it considers UAVs with heterogeneous, unknown energy storage capacities and assumes no knowledge of the energy consumption models. We propose a decentralised deployment strategy that combines auction-based task allocation with online learning. Each UAV independently decides whether to bid for orders based on its energy storage charge level, the parcel mass, and delivery distance. Over time, it refines its policy to bid only for orders within its capability. Simulations using realistic UAV energy models reveal that, counter-intuitively, assigning orders to the least confident bidders reduces delivery times and increases the number of successfully fulfilled orders. This strategy is shown to outperform threshold-based methods which require UAVs to exceed specific charge levels at deployment. We propose a variant of the strategy which uses learned policies for forecasting. This enables UAVs with insufficient charge levels to commit to fulfilling orders at specific future times, helping to prioritise early orders. Our work provides new insights into long-term deployment of UAV swarms, highlighting the advantages of decentralised energy-aware decision-making coupled with online learning in real-world dynamic environments.",
  "summary": "This paper explores decentralized control of a drone delivery fleet with *unknown and varied* battery health.  Drones bid on delivery tasks based on their current charge, parcel weight, and delivery distance, learning over time which tasks they can realistically complete. Surprisingly, prioritizing \"least confident\" bidders (those closest to their capability limits) improves overall efficiency.  The research also introduces a forecasting element where drones can reserve future deliveries, improving early order prioritization.\n\nKey points for LLM-based multi-agent systems:\n\n* **Decentralized control and bidding:** Individual LLMs could manage each drone, bidding autonomously on tasks and refining their bidding strategies through experience.\n* **Capability learning:** LLMs can dynamically learn their limitations (analogous to battery health) related to task complexity, processing time, or resource constraints.\n* **Forecasting:** LLMs can predict future capabilities and reserve tasks accordingly, enhancing scheduling and resource allocation in multi-agent scenarios.\n* **Heterogeneity:** This research underscores the importance of handling agents with different capabilities, which is a common challenge in LLM-based systems.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents exciting opportunities for JavaScript developers working with LLM-based multi-agent applications, especially in web development contexts. Here's how a JavaScript developer can translate the research insights into practical applications:\n\n**1. Decentralized Bidding and Task Allocation:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine building a collaborative web application for project management where multiple LLM agents represent team members with different skills (writing, coding, design).  Tasks arrive dynamically, and agents need to bid on them based on their expertise and availability.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * Use a JavaScript library like Socket.IO to create real-time communication between agents.\n    * Each agent (represented by a JavaScript object) can host an LLM locally or interact with a cloud-based LLM API.\n    * The bidding policy (π(x) in the paper) can be implemented using a small neural network within the agent, trained using TensorFlow.js or a similar library. Inputs (x) would be task features (complexity, type), agent's current workload, and confidence level.\n    * Implement the \"least confident\" winner selection in a central coordinator module using JavaScript.  This counterintuitive approach, as highlighted in the paper, can lead to better overall task distribution and efficiency.\n\n**2. Online Learning of Agent Capabilities:**\n\n* **Scenario:** In a customer support chatbot system, multiple LLM agents handle different types of queries. Initially, their specializations might not be perfectly defined.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * After each interaction, the agent receives feedback (positive/negative).\n    * This feedback, along with the query features, is used to update the agent's bidding policy (using SGD as described in the paper) using TensorFlow.js.\n    * Over time, agents become more specialized and bid more accurately on queries they can handle effectively, improving customer experience.\n\n**3. Forecasting and Reservation System:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Building a web-based scheduling assistant for meetings.  LLM agents represent participants with different calendars and availability. Meetings requests arrive dynamically.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * If an agent (participant) is currently unavailable but predicts future availability, it can submit a reservation bid with a timestamp.\n    * This reservation system, implemented in JavaScript on the server, allows for pre-allocation of resources (meeting slots) and prioritizes earlier requests, as the paper suggests.\n\n**4. Heterogeneous Agent Capabilities (Simulated with LLMs):**\n\n* **Scenario:** A multi-agent web game where LLMs control different characters with varying strengths and weaknesses.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * Simulate heterogeneity by prompting LLMs with different personas or restricting their access to certain information. For example, a \"junior\" agent could have a smaller context window or be prompted with less detailed instructions compared to a \"senior\" agent.  This mimics the varying battery health in the drones.\n    * Observe how the \"least confident\" bidding strategy still leads to effective team play despite these differences in LLM capabilities.\n\n**JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries:**\n\n* **TensorFlow.js:** For implementing and training the bidding policies within the browser or on Node.js.\n* **Socket.IO:** For real-time communication between agents.\n* **LangChain:**  Can be used for orchestrating interactions between LLMs and other components of the system.\n* **React, Vue, or Angular:** For building the frontend UI of the web applications.\n\n**Key Takeaways for JavaScript Developers:**\n\n* **Decentralization:**  Empowering agents with individual decision-making using local LLMs can improve scalability and robustness.\n* **Online Learning:** Continuous adaptation is crucial in dynamic environments.  Implement feedback loops and online training using JavaScript libraries.\n* **Least Confident Bidding:**  Don't dismiss this counterintuitive strategy! It can lead to surprising improvements in task allocation.\n* **Forecasting:**  Integrate predictive capabilities to handle resource constraints and prioritize tasks effectively.\n\nBy applying these insights and leveraging readily available JavaScript tools, developers can unlock the potential of multi-agent LLM systems in building intelligent and adaptive web applications. This approach bridges the gap between cutting-edge AI research and practical web development, leading to a new era of dynamic and collaborative web experiences.",
  "pseudocode": "The paper doesn't contain explicit pseudocode blocks, but several algorithms and mathematical formulas can be translated into JavaScript functions. Here are the key algorithms and their JavaScript representations:\n\n**1. Bidding Decision (ba(x))**:\n\n```javascript\nfunction biddingDecision(distance, mass, soc, weightVector, bias) {\n  // Calculate the decision function f(x)\n  const f_x = math.dot(weightVector, [distance, mass, soc]) + bias;\n\n  // Return 1 if capable, 0 if not\n  return f_x >= 0 ? 1 : 0;\n}\n```\n\n* **Purpose**: Determines whether a UAV should bid on a delivery task based on the task's distance (`distance`), parcel mass (`mass`), the UAV's state of charge (`soc`), a learned `weightVector`, and a `bias`. It uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) as the decision function.  The `math.dot` function (assuming a math library like Math.js is being used) calculates the dot product.\n\n\n**2. Bid Value (bu(x))**:\n\n```javascript\nfunction bidValue(distance, mass, soc, weightVector, bias) {\n  // Calculate f(x) (same as in biddingDecision)\n  const f_x = math.dot(weightVector, [distance, mass, soc]) + bias;\n\n  // Calculate the Euclidean norm of the weight vector\n  const norm_w = math.norm(weightVector);\n\n  // Calculate and return the bid value\n  return f_x / (norm_w * norm_w); \n}\n\n```\n\n* **Purpose**:  Calculates the UAV's bid value based on the same inputs as `biddingDecision`. The bid value reflects the UAV's confidence in completing the task.  A higher bid value indicates greater confidence.  Again, Math.js or similar would provide the `math.norm` function.\n\n\n**3. Feature Standardization**:\n\n```javascript\nfunction standardizeFeatures(features, mean, stdDev) {\n  return features.map((feature, index) => (feature - mean[index]) / stdDev[index]);\n}\n```\n\n* **Purpose**: Standardizes the input features (`features` – an array containing distance, mass, and soc) using Z-score normalization. It requires pre-calculated `mean` and `stdDev` arrays for each feature.\n\n\n**4. SGD Update**:\n\n```javascript\nfunction sgdUpdate(weights, bias, learningRate, features, trueLabel, alpha) {\n  const prediction = math.dot(weights, features) + bias;\n  const lossGradient_w = lossGradient(trueLabel, prediction, features);\n  const lossGradient_b = lossGradient(trueLabel, prediction); // Bias derivative is simpler\n\n  const regularizationGradient_w = weights.map(w => w); // For L2 regularization\n\n  const updatedWeights = weights.map((w, i) => w - learningRate * (lossGradient_w[i] + alpha * regularizationGradient_w[i]));\n  const updatedBias = bias - learningRate * lossGradient_b;\n\n  return { updatedWeights, updatedBias };\n}\n\n// Example Huber loss gradient (simplified):\nfunction lossGradient(trueLabel, prediction, features) {\n  const y = 2 * trueLabel - 1; // Transform label to -1, 1\n\n  if (y * prediction >= -1) {\n      return features.map(f => -y * f); // Derivative for the first case\n  } else {\n     return features.map(f => 4 * y * prediction * f); // Derivative for the second case\n  }\n}\n\n\n```\n\n* **Purpose**: Updates the SVM's `weights` and `bias` using Stochastic Gradient Descent. The code uses a helper function `lossGradient` which would need to be fully implemented based on equation 7. This example shows a simplified `lossGradient` function, assuming the first branch of the equation 7 always holds true.  Note the use of alpha for regularization strength.\n\n\n**5. Charging Rate (∆charge(t))**:\n\n```javascript\nfunction chargingRate(soc, theoreticalCapacity, chargerPower, chargerEfficiency) {\n  return (100 - soc) * chargerPower * chargerEfficiency / (3600 * theoreticalCapacity);\n}\n```\n\n* **Purpose**:  Calculates the rate at which a UAV's battery charges.\n\n\n**6.  Consumption Rate (∆delivery(mp))**:\n\n```javascript\nfunction consumptionRate(payloadMass, frameMass, batteryMass, numRotors, rotorArea, gravity, airDensity, theoreticalCapacity, soh) {\n  const cps = Math.pow(gravity * (frameMass + batteryMass + payloadMass), 1.5) / (3600 * Math.sqrt(2 * numRotors * rotorArea * airDensity));\n  return -100 * cps / (theoreticalCapacity * soh);\n}\n```\n\n* **Purpose**:  Calculates the rate at which a UAV's battery discharges during delivery.\n\nThese JavaScript functions provide a practical starting point for JavaScript developers to experiment with the concepts presented in the research paper. Remember to include a suitable math library (like Math.js) for vector and matrix operations.  Also, the `lossGradient` and its associated Huber Loss calculation would need to be fully implemented to match the research.",
