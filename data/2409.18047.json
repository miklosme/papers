  "title": "HARMONIC: Cognitive and Control Collaboration in Human-Robotic Teams",
  "abstract": "Abstract-This paper presents a novel approach to multi-robot planning and collaboration. We demonstrate a cognitive strategy for robots in human-robot teams that incorporates metacognition, natural language communication, and explainability. The system is embodied using the HARMONIC architecture that flexibly integrates cognitive and control capabilities across the team. We evaluate our approach through simulation experiments involving a joint search task by a team of heterogeneous robots (a UGV and a drone) and a human. We detail the system's handling of complex, real-world scenarios, effective action coordination between robots with different capabilities, and natural human-robot communication. This work demonstrates that the robots' ability to reason about plans, goals, and attitudes, and to provide explanations for actions and decisions are essential prerequisites for realistic human-robot teaming.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces HARMONIC, a new system for multi-robot collaboration that emphasizes natural language communication, explainability, and cognitive abilities like understanding team structure and adapting to new information. \n\nKey features relevant to LLM-based multi-agent systems:\n\n* **Human-like communication:** HARMONIC robots understand and generate natural language, allowing them to seamlessly interact with human teammates.\n* **Transparency and explainability:** Unlike black-box LLMs, HARMONIC focuses on \"glass-box\" modules, making its decision-making processes clear and understandable, which is crucial for building trust in human-robot teams. \n* **Cognitive control:** The system combines high-level, strategic reasoning (similar to LLMs) with low-level, reactive robot control, allowing for flexible and adaptable behavior in complex tasks.",
  "takeaways": "##  HARMONIC for JavaScript Developers: Building Collaborative AI Teams on the Web\n\nThis paper, while focused on robotics, offers valuable insights for JavaScript developers building LLM-based multi-agent AI systems for the web. Let's break down how you can apply these concepts:\n\n**1. Dual-Control Architecture with LLMs:**\n\n* **Strategic Layer (System 2):** This is where your LLM shines!  Use it for:\n    * **Natural Language Understanding & Generation:**  Process user commands, enable inter-agent communication, and provide human-readable explanations using libraries like `Hugging Face Transformers.js` or `TensorFlow.js`.\n    * **High-Level Planning & Goal Management:**  Employ the concept of \"meta-plans\" to create reusable logic for common tasks (e.g., collaborative document editing). Frameworks like `ReasonerJS` or `Cyc.js` could assist with knowledge representation and reasoning.\n    * **Dynamic Task Allocation:** Based on agent capabilities (defined in JavaScript), use the LLM to dynamically assign roles like \"leader\" or \"subordinate\" within a multi-agent interaction.\n* **Tactical Layer (System 1):**\n    * **Reactive Control & Real-time Actions:**  Use JavaScript to handle real-time events in your web application, such as UI updates, data synchronization, or API calls. Consider libraries like `Socket.IO` for real-time communication between agents.\n    * **Behavior Trees for Modular Actions:** Represent low-level actions (e.g., \"fetch data,\" \"update UI\") as modular Behavior Trees using libraries like `behavior3js` or `jbtree`. \n\n**2. Web Application Scenarios:**\n\n* **Collaborative Editing:** Imagine a Google Docs-like application where multiple LLMs, each representing a user, work together to draft content, suggest edits, and ensure consistency. HARMONIC's communication and planning principles can be applied here.\n* **AI-Powered Customer Support:**  A team of specialized AI agents, some trained for product knowledge and others for customer interaction, collaborate to resolve user queries in real time.\n* **Interactive Storytelling:**  Create a choose-your-own-adventure game where multiple LLMs, each embodying a different character, interact with each other and the player through a web interface.\n\n**3. Practical JavaScript Examples:**\n\n```javascript\n// Simplified example using Hugging Face Transformers.js for LLM interaction\n\nconst model = new pipeline('text-generation', 'google/flan-t5-xl'); \n\n// Strategic Layer (LLM-powered)\nasync function generatePlan(goal, agents) {\n  const prompt = `Goal: ${goal}\\nAgents: ${agents}\\nGenerate a plan:`;\n  const response = await model(prompt);\n  return response[0].generated_text; \n}\n\n// Tactical Layer (JavaScript)\nfunction executeAction(action, agent) {\n  // Implement action logic based on action type and agent capabilities\n  if (action.type === 'fetch_data') {\n    fetch(action.url)\n      .then(data => agent.updateData(data))\n  } \n  // ... handle other action types\n}\n```\n\n**4.  Benefits for JavaScript Developers:**\n\n* **Human-AI Collaboration:** Build more intuitive and collaborative web applications where AI agents act as helpful partners, understanding user intent and proactively offering assistance.\n* **Transparency and Explainability:** By combining LLMs with explicit knowledge representation and reasoning in the strategic layer, you can make your AI systems more understandable and trustworthy.\n* **Efficiency and Reusability:** HARMONIC's modular design promotes code reusability and simplifies the development of complex multi-agent interactions.\n\n**This paper provides a valuable roadmap for JavaScript developers entering the world of LLM-based multi-agent systems. By leveraging JavaScript's strengths in real-time web applications and combining them with the power of LLMs, you can create the next generation of collaborative and intelligent web experiences.**",
