  "title": "On-Device Federated Continual Learning on RISC-V-based Ultra-Low-Power SoC for Intelligent Nano-Drone Swarms",
  "abstract": "RISC-V-based architectures are paving the way for efficient On-Device Learning (ODL) in smart edge devices. When applied across multiple nodes, ODL enables the creation of intelligent sensor networks that preserve data privacy. However, developing ODL-capable, battery-operated embedded platforms presents significant challenges due to constrained computational resources and limited device lifetime, besides intrinsic learning issues such as catastrophic forgetting. We face these challenges by proposing a regularization-based On-Device Federated Continual Learning algorithm tailored for multiple nano-drones performing face recognition tasks. We demonstrate our approach on a RISC-V-based 10-core ultra-low-power SoC, optimizing the ODL computational requirements. We improve the classification accuracy by 24% over naive fine-tuning, requiring 178 ms per local epoch and 10.5s per global epoch, demonstrating the effectiveness of the architecture for this task.",
  "summary": "This research demonstrates on-device federated continual learning (ODFCL) for face recognition on a swarm of resource-constrained nano-drones.  It uses a regularized version of federated learning (FedProx) combined with a continual learning technique (MOL) on a RISC-V based multi-core SoC to allow the drones to learn new faces incrementally without forgetting previously learned ones, while preserving data privacy by avoiding raw data sharing.\n\nKey points for LLM-based multi-agent systems:\n\n* **Decentralized Learning:** The federated learning approach allows multiple agents (drones) to collaboratively train a shared model without exchanging raw data, a valuable concept for privacy-preserving multi-agent LLM applications.\n* **Continual Learning:** The ability to incrementally learn new information (new faces) without forgetting prior knowledge is crucial for long-term deployment of LLM-based agents in dynamic environments.\n* **Resource Efficiency:** Demonstrating this technique on a low-power embedded system is relevant for deploying complex LLM agents on resource-constrained devices, potentially expanding the reach of multi-agent LLM applications beyond server environments.\n* **Specialization & Collaboration:**  Each drone can potentially specialize in recognizing specific sets of faces and then contribute to a shared, more comprehensive model through the federated learning process. This mirrors specialized roles within a collaborative multi-agent LLM system.",
  "takeaways": "This paper focuses on on-device federated continual learning for resource-constrained devices, a concept highly relevant to the future of web development where AI processing might be offloaded to client devices like browsers. While the paper implements the system on a RISC-V SoC, the core concepts can inspire JavaScript developers working with LLMs in multi-agent web applications.  Here's how:\n\n**1. Federated Learning of LLMs in the Browser:**\n\n* **Concept:** Instead of relying solely on a centralized, powerful server for LLM inference and fine-tuning, distribute the workload across multiple user browsers. Each browser acts as an agent, training a smaller, localized version of the LLM on user-specific data.  This preserves privacy and reduces server load.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**  A JavaScript library could be developed to manage the federated learning process. This library would handle:\n    * **Model Partitioning:** Splitting the LLM into smaller chunks suitable for browser execution using techniques like Tensorflow.js layers API.\n    * **Local Training:**  Fine-tuning the localized model on the user's device using client-side machine learning libraries like ONNX.js or WebGPU.\n    * **Model Aggregation:** Securely aggregating updates from multiple browsers using differential privacy techniques and a central server.  Node.js could be used for server-side logic.\n* **Example:** Imagine a collaborative writing application where each user's browser helps fine-tune a grammar and style checking LLM based on their individual writing style.\n\n\n**2. Continual Learning for Personalized Web Experiences:**\n\n* **Concept:** Websites and web apps can personalize user experiences by continually learning from user interactions.  Each user's browser agent maintains a personalized LLM that evolves over time, adapting to individual preferences without catastrophic forgetting.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** Using libraries like localForage or IndexedDB, store the user-specific LLM parameters within the browser.  Implement continual learning algorithms inspired by the paper's regularization-based approach (Mean Output Loss) to ensure new knowledge doesn't overwrite previous learning.\n* **Example:** A news aggregator site could use a personalized LLM to filter and prioritize news articles based on a user's evolving interests. As the user interacts with the site, the LLM in the browser continually adapts its recommendations.\n\n\n**3. Multi-Agent Content Creation and Moderation:**\n\n* **Concept:**  Multiple LLM-powered agents could collaborate on tasks like content creation, translation, or moderation.  Each agent specializes in a specific aspect of the task and communicates with other agents to achieve the overall goal.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** Create separate JavaScript modules for each agent, each housing a specialized LLM.  Use a message-passing system, perhaps using libraries like PeerJS or Socket.IO, for inter-agent communication and coordination.\n* **Example:**  In a collaborative document editor, one agent could focus on grammar, another on style, and a third on fact-checking. They would interact to provide comprehensive feedback to the user.\n\n**4. Resource-Aware LLM Execution in the Browser:**\n\n* **Concept:**  The paper emphasizes resource efficiency. Similarly, JavaScript developers need to consider browser limitations when deploying LLMs. Techniques like model quantization and pruning can reduce the memory and processing footprint.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**  Use Tensorflow.js's model optimization tools to quantize and prune LLMs for browser execution.  Monitor browser resource usage (CPU, memory) and dynamically adjust LLM complexity to maintain a smooth user experience.\n* **Example:** A web-based image editing tool could use a lightweight, quantized LLM for image captioning or object recognition directly in the browser, avoiding server roundtrips.\n\n**Key Takeaways for JavaScript Developers:**\n\n* The principles of federated and continual learning can be applied to LLMs in web applications, leveraging the power of distributed computing and personalized experiences.\n* JavaScript libraries and frameworks provide the tools necessary to implement these concepts, including model partitioning, local training, model aggregation, and resource management.\n* By understanding the research presented in papers like this, JavaScript developers can push the boundaries of what's possible with LLMs in the browser, creating more engaging, intelligent, and personalized web experiences.",
  "pseudocode": "No pseudocode block found. However, the paper describes an On-Device Federated Continual Learning (ODFCL) algorithm which incorporates Mean Output Loss (MOL) and FedProx.  While not explicitly presented as pseudocode, we can represent the core logic in JavaScript.\n\n```javascript\nasync function odfcl(nodes, globalModel, K, sessions) {\n  // Initialize the global model\n  let mtGlobal = globalModel; \n\n  for (let s = 0; s < sessions; s++) {  // Iterate through learning sessions\n    const sessionClasses = K.slice(s * nodes.length, (s + 1) * nodes.length);\n\n    // Parallel training on each node (could be implemented with Web Workers)\n    const localUpdates = await Promise.all(\n      nodes.map(async (node, i) => {\n        const localClasses = [sessionClasses[i]]; // Classes for this node\n        let mtLocal = { ...mtGlobal }; // Copy the global model\n\n        for (let epoch = 0; epoch < numEpochs; epoch++) {\n          // Training loop on each node with MOL regularization\n          const loss = await node.train(localClasses, mtLocal, mu); \n          mtLocal = updateModel(mtLocal, loss); // Update local model\n        }\n\n        return calculateUpdate(mtLocal, mtGlobal, lambda); // FedProx\n      })\n    );\n\n    // Aggregate local updates (server-side logic)\n    mtGlobal = aggregateUpdates(mtGlobal, localUpdates);\n\n    // Distribute the updated global model to all nodes\n    nodes.forEach(node => node.updateGlobalModel(mtGlobal)); \n  }\n\n  return mtGlobal;\n}\n\n\n// Example placeholder functions â€“ these would be implemented with a specific ML library\nfunction updateModel(model, loss) {  /* Apply gradients based on loss*/ return model; }\nfunction calculateUpdate(local, global, lambda) {/* FedProx update calculation */ return update;}\nfunction aggregateUpdates(global, updates) {/* Average updates from all nodes */ return global;}\n\n// Example usage - Assuming 'nodes' is an array of objects with a 'train' method\nconst globalModel = loadModel();  // Load pre-trained model\nconst K = [/* Array of classes */ ];\nconst numSessions = K.length / nodes.length;\nconst mu = 2;  // MOL regularization factor\nconst lambda = 3.8; // FedProx regularization factor\nconst numEpochs = 10; // Number of local training epochs\n\nconst finalModel = await odfcl(nodes, globalModel, K, numSessions);\nsaveModel(finalModel);\n```\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThis JavaScript code simulates the ODFCL process described in the paper.\n\n1. **Initialization:** The global model (`mtGlobal`) is initialized.\n2. **Session Loop:** The algorithm iterates through learning sessions, distributing new classes (`K`) among the nodes.\n3. **Parallel Training:** Each node trains on its assigned classes using a copy of the global model (`mtLocal`). MOL regularization is applied during local training.  This could be parallelized in a web application using Web Workers.\n4. **FedProx Update Calculation:**  After local training, each node calculates its update using the FedProx algorithm, considering the difference between its local model and the global model.\n5. **Aggregation:** The server aggregates updates from all nodes to create a new global model.\n6. **Distribution:**  The updated global model is distributed back to each node.\n7. **Iteration:** Steps 2-6 are repeated for each learning session.\n\n\n**Purpose:** The ODFCL algorithm aims to enable continual learning in a federated setting, addressing the challenge of catastrophic forgetting while preserving data privacy by keeping data on individual devices.  The use of FedProx allows for efficient distributed training even with heterogeneous node capabilities (e.g. different network bandwidths).\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Federated Learning:** Training a shared model across multiple decentralized devices without exchanging raw data.\n* **Continual Learning:**  Training a model on a sequence of tasks, retaining knowledge from previous tasks.\n* **Mean Output Loss (MOL):** A regularization technique that minimizes the change in output activations for previously learned classes, mitigating catastrophic forgetting.\n* **FedProx:** A modified version of federated averaging that handles device heterogeneity and partial participation.\n\nThis JavaScript implementation provides a high-level overview of the ODFCL process.  A real-world implementation would require integrating with a machine learning library (like TensorFlow.js or WebDNN) for model training and handling tensor operations.  This example demonstrates how complex multi-agent research concepts can be translated into practical JavaScript code for web developers exploring LLM-based multi-agent systems.",
