  "title": "Inferring Short-Sightedness in Dynamic Noncooperative Games",
  "abstract": "Dynamic game theory is an increasingly popular tool for modeling multi-agent, e.g., human-robot, interactions. Game-theoretic models presume that each agent wishes to minimize a private cost function that depends on others' actions. These games typically evolve over a fixed time horizon, which specifies the degree to which all agents care about the distant future. In practical settings, however, decision-makers may vary in their degree of short-sightedness. We conjecture that quantifying and estimating each agent's short-sightedness from online data will enable safer and more efficient interactions with other agents. To this end, we frame this inference problem as an inverse dynamic game. We consider a specific parametrization of each agent's objective function that smoothly interpolates myopic and farsighted planning. Games of this form are readily transformed into parametric mixed complementarity problems; we exploit the directional differentiability of solutions to these problems with respect to their hidden parameters in order to solve for agents' short-sightedness. We conduct several experiments simulating human behavior at a real-world crosswalk. The results of these experiments clearly demonstrate that by explicitly inferring agents' short-sightedness, we can recover more accurate game-theoretic models, which ultimately allow us to make better predictions of agents' behavior. Specifically, our results show up to a 30% more accurate prediction of myopic behavior compared to the baseline.",
  "summary": "This paper addresses the problem of inferring how far ahead agents (e.g., humans or robots) plan in multi-agent interactions, specifically when their objectives are unknown.  It introduces a method to estimate the \"short-sightedness\" or \"myopia\" of agents by modeling how much they discount future costs. This is done by formulating an inverse dynamic game and solving it using gradient descent on a differentiable Mixed Complementarity Problem (MiCP) representing the game's equilibrium conditions.\n\nFor LLM-based multi-agent systems, this research is relevant because it offers a way to model and reason about agents with varying levels of planning depth.  This could be used to improve the accuracy of predicting agent behavior, particularly in scenarios with limited information or noisy observations, which is typical for LLMs interacting in a complex environment.  The ability to estimate short-sightedness could be incorporated into LLM agents' decision-making processes, leading to more robust and effective interactions.  Moreover, using a MiCP formulation could offer computational advantages for integrating these concepts into practical LLM-based multi-agent applications.",
  "takeaways": "This research paper offers valuable insights for JavaScript developers working with LLM-based multi-agent systems, particularly in modeling realistic agent behavior within web applications. Here are some practical examples of how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights:\n\n**1. Modeling Realistic User Interactions in a Collaborative Web App:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine building a collaborative writing platform where multiple users (agents) simultaneously edit a document.  Each user has individual preferences (e.g., writing style, pacing) that influence their interactions.\n* **Applying the Paper's Insights:**  Instead of assuming all users are equally farsighted in their edits (caring equally about the entire document), incorporate the concept of \"short-sightedness.\"  Some users might focus heavily on the current paragraph (myopic), while others consider the overall document structure (farsighted).\n* **Implementation in JavaScript:**\n    * Use a JavaScript framework like React or Vue.js to manage the application state.\n    * Represent each user as an agent with a \"discount factor\" (gamma) parameter.  A lower gamma represents higher myopia.  This parameter could be learned from user behavior or explicitly set by the user.\n    * Use the LangChain framework and its JavaScript integrations to integrate LLMs into agents' decision-making. Prompt the LLMs with the current document state and the agent's discount factor to generate edit suggestions. The discount factor can be incorporated directly into the prompt or used to weight different parts of the document in the agent's internal representation.\n    *  Implement a conflict resolution mechanism that considers each agent's discount factor. Myopic agents might have priority for local edits, while farsighted agents have more influence on global changes.\n\n**2. Building a Multi-Agent Chatbot System:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Develop a chatbot system for customer support, where multiple specialized bots (agents) handle different aspects of a customer query (e.g., order tracking, technical support, billing).\n* **Applying the Paper's Insights:** Each bot can be modeled with a different level of \"short-sightedness\" based on its specialization.  A bot focused on order tracking might be more myopic, primarily concerned with the immediate order status, while a technical support bot might be more farsighted, considering the customer's past interactions and potential future issues.\n* **Implementation in JavaScript:**\n    * Use Node.js with a library like `socket.io` for real-time communication between bots and the user interface.\n    *  Implement each bot as an agent with a specific discount factor.\n    *  Use a message broker (like Redis) to route customer queries to the appropriate bot based on keywords and context.\n    * The discount factor can influence the LLM prompt, biasing it towards short-term or long-term considerations. For example, a myopic bot might be prompted to \"Provide the current status of order X,\" while a farsighted bot might be prompted to \"Analyze the customer's issue, considering their past interactions and potential solutions.\"\n\n**3. Developing a Multi-Agent Game in the Browser:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Create a real-time strategy game where players control multiple units (agents) with different roles and strategies.\n* **Applying the Paper's Insights:**  Units with different roles could have varying levels of short-sightedness.  For example, a scout unit might be very myopic, focused on immediate exploration, while a base builder might be more farsighted, planning for long-term resource management.\n* **Implementation in JavaScript:**\n    * Use a game engine like Phaser or Babylon.js.\n    * Represent each unit as an agent with a discount factor.\n    * Use the paper's suggested gradient descent approach (adapted for JavaScript) to learn or refine discount factors based on observed player behavior.\n    *  The discount factor can influence the unit's AI logic, determining how far ahead it plans its actions. For example, a myopic scout might only consider the immediate surroundings, while a farsighted builder might plan construction projects several turns in advance.\n\n\n\n**Key JavaScript Libraries and Frameworks:**\n\n* **Frontend:** React, Vue.js, Angular\n* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js\n* **Real-time Communication:** Socket.io\n* **Game Engines:** Phaser, Babylon.js\n* **LLM integration:** LangChain\n* **Numerical Computation (if implementing gradient descent):** TensorFlow.js, NumJs\n\nBy incorporating these insights, JavaScript developers can create more realistic and engaging multi-agent systems that better reflect human behavior and decision-making processes in various web applications. The ability to model short-sightedness allows for more nuanced agent interactions and more accurate predictions of agent behavior, ultimately leading to more intelligent and adaptive web experiences.",

It utilizes a gradient descent approach, iteratively refining estimates of theta and gamma to minimize a given objective function `P` (which measures the discrepancy between predicted and observed game trajectories).\n\nThe algorithm relies on solving a Mixed Complementarity Problem (MCP) within each iteration to find the equilibrium state and actions of the game given the current estimates of theta and gamma. The gradient of the objective function is then calculated using the solution of the MCP and used to update theta and gamma. The `gamma` values are projected onto the feasible range [0, 1] in each iteration. This process continues until convergence or a maximum number of iterations is reached.\n\nThe core steps are:\n\n1. **Inner MCP Solution:** The `solveInnerMCP` function solves the MCP representing the game's equilibrium conditions.  This function's implementation is problem-specific and would likely use a specialized MCP solver like PATH.\n2. **Gradient Calculation:** The `calcGradient` function calculates the gradient of the objective function with respect to theta and gamma, incorporating the solution of the MCP. This function is also problem-specific and needs to be implemented based on the dynamics and objective function of the particular game.\n3. **Parameter Updates:**  Theta and gamma are updated using gradient descent, with a learning rate `alpha`. Gamma is projected onto [0, 1] to maintain feasibility.\n4. **Convergence Check:** The algorithm terminates if the change in theta is below a certain threshold (`convergenceThreshold`) or the maximum number of iterations (`maxIterations`) is reached.\n\n\n\nThis structure allows the algorithm to effectively handle the coupled nature of the optimization problem (estimating game parameters while ensuring equilibrium constraints are satisfied) and deal with the non-smoothness introduced by the complementarity conditions of the MCP.  The JavaScript code provides a general framework; the helper functions (`solveInnerMCP` and `calcGradient`) and the objective function (`P`, used within `calcGradient`) need to be adapted for the specific game being analyzed.",
