  "title": "Debate-Driven Multi-Agent LLMs for Phishing Email Detection",
  "abstract": "Abstract-Phishing attacks remain a critical cybersecurity threat. Attackers constantly refine their methods, making phishing emails harder to detect. Traditional detection methods, including rule-based systems and supervised machine learning models, either rely on predefined patterns like blacklists, which can be bypassed with slight modifications, or require large datasets for training and still can generate false positives and false negatives. In this work, we propose a multi-agent large language model (LLM) prompting technique that simulates debates among agents to detect whether the content presented on an email is phishing. Our approach uses two LLM agents to present arguments for or against the classification task, with a judge agent adjudicating the final verdict based on the quality of reasoning provided. This debate mechanism enables the models to critically analyze contextual cue and deceptive patterns in text, which leads to improved classification accuracy. The proposed framework is evaluated on multiple phishing email datasets and demonstrate that mixed-agent configurations consistently outperform homogeneous configurations. Results also show that the debate structure itself is sufficient to yield accurate decisions without extra prompting strategies.",
  "summary": "This research explores using multiple LLMs in a \"debate\" format to detect phishing emails. Two \"debater\" LLMs argue for and against an email being phishing, while a \"judge\" LLM evaluates their arguments to make a final decision.\n\nKey points:\n\n* **Heterogeneous agents perform better:**  Mixing different LLM types (e.g., GPT-4 and LLaMA-2) as debaters and judges improves accuracy compared to using the same LLM for all roles.\n* **Debate structure is sufficient:**  Additional prompting techniques like chain-of-thought or role prompting did *not* significantly improve results beyond the core debate structure. This suggests the debate format itself encourages effective reasoning.\n* **Relevance to multi-agent systems:** This research highlights the potential of structured multi-agent interaction (debate) for enhancing LLM reasoning in complex tasks like phishing detection, offering a practical example of LLM-based multi-agent system design.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents a compelling case for debate-driven multi-agent LLM systems for phishing detection, offering valuable insights applicable to various web development scenarios involving LLMs and multi-agent systems.  Let's explore how a JavaScript developer can leverage these insights:\n\n**1. Building a Multi-Agent Phishing Detection System:**\n\n* **Concept:** Implement a client-side or server-side system that analyzes suspicious emails using multiple LLMs.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * **LLM Integration:** Use a JavaScript library like `langchain` or a cloud-based LLM API (e.g., OpenAI, Cohere) to integrate the LLM agents (GPT-4, LLaMA 2, or similar).\n    * **Agent Architecture:** Create separate JavaScript classes or modules for each agent (pro-phishing, anti-phishing, judge). Each agent would interact with the LLM using the chosen integration method.\n    * **Debate Orchestration:**  Design a function to orchestrate the debate. It would send the email text to each debater agent, receive their arguments, and then forward the collected arguments to the judge agent for the final verdict.\n    * **UI Integration (Client-Side):** If client-side, integrate this system into a browser extension or email client using JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js.  Display the verdict prominently to the user.\n    * **Backend Integration (Server-Side):** If server-side, integrate into an email gateway or security system using Node.js and Express.js.  Log verdicts and take appropriate actions (e.g., quarantine emails).\n\n**Example (Simplified Server-Side with Node.js and `langchain`):**\n\n```javascript\n// ... import necessary libraries (langchain, express, etc.)\n\n// Initialize LLM agents (replace with your preferred models)\nconst proPhishingAgent = new LLMChain({ llm: new OpenAI(), ... });\nconst antiPhishingAgent = new LLMChain({ llm: new Cohere(), ... });\nconst judgeAgent = new LLMChain({ llm: new OpenAI(), ... });\n\n// Debate orchestration function\nasync function debate(emailText) {\n    const proArgument = await proPhishingAgent.call({ email: emailText });\n    const antiArgument = await antiPhishingAgent.call({ email: emailText });\n    const verdict = await judgeAgent.call({\n        pro: proArgument.text,\n        anti: antiArgument.text,\n    });\n    return verdict.text;\n}\n\n// ... Express.js route handler\napp.post('/analyze', async (req, res) => {\n    const emailText = req.body.email;\n    const result = await debate(emailText);\n    res.json({ verdict: result });\n});\n```\n\n**2. Exploring Heterogeneous Agent Configurations:**\n\n* **Concept:** Experiment with different LLM combinations for debater and judge agents, as the research suggests that heterogeneous configurations (different LLMs) often outperform homogeneous ones.\n* **Implementation:** Easily swap out the LLMs used in the example above by changing the instantiation of the `LLMChain` objects. This allows testing various combinations to determine the optimal performance for your specific use case.\n\n**3. Implementing Multi-Agent Systems for Other Web Tasks:**\n\n* **Concept:** Extend the debate framework to other web development domains that require complex reasoning or decision-making. Examples:\n    * **Content Moderation:** Debate the appropriateness of user-generated content.\n    * **E-commerce Product Recommendations:**  Agents debate the suitability of products based on user preferences.\n    * **Automated Customer Support:** Agents debate the best response to customer inquiries.\n* **Implementation:** Adapt the debate structure and prompts to the specific task, ensuring that the agents have clearly defined roles and objectives.\n\n**4.  Focusing on Argument Quality over Prompt Engineering Tricks:**\n\n* **Concept:** The research shows that the debate framework itself is powerful, and complex prompt engineering techniques like Chain-of-Thought or Role Prompting might not provide significant additional benefits.  Prioritize clear, concise prompts focused on the core arguments.\n* **Implementation:**  Keep your prompts simple and direct, focusing on guiding the agents to make strong arguments for their respective stances.  Avoid overly complex or convoluted prompting strategies.\n\n\nBy following these examples and adapting them to your specific needs, you can leverage the power of multi-agent debate systems to enhance the capabilities of your LLM-powered web applications.  Remember that this is a rapidly evolving field, and continuous experimentation is key to unlocking the full potential of multi-agent AI in web development.",
