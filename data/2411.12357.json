  "title": "A Layered Architecture for Developing and Enhancing Capabilities in Large Language Model-based Software Systems",
  "abstract": "Significant efforts have been made to expand the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) beyond basic language tasks. While the generalizability and versatility of LLMs have enabled widespread adoption, evolving demands in application development often exceed their native capabilities. Meeting these demands may involve a diverse set of methods, such as enhancing creativity through either inference temperature adjustments or creativity-provoking prompts. Selecting the right approach is critical, as different methods lead to trade-offs in engineering complexity, scalability, and operational costs. This paper introduces a layered architecture that organizes LLM software system development into distinct layers, each characterized by specific attributes. By aligning capabilities with these layers, the framework encourages the systematic implementation of capabilities in effective and efficient ways that ultimately supports desired functionalities and qualities. Through practical case studies, we illustrate the utility of the framework. This work offers developers actionable insights for selecting suitable technologies in LLM-based software system development, promoting robustness and scalability.",
  "summary": "This paper proposes a layered architecture (Model, Inference, and Application) for developing LLM-based software systems, focusing on systematically implementing and enhancing capabilities beyond the LLMs' native abilities. It emphasizes mapping desired functionalities to specific layers and components within the architecture, considering attributes like knowledge boundaries, efficiency, and control over token generation. This structured approach aims to improve the development process, promoting robustness and scalability in LLM-based applications, particularly for multi-agent systems where orchestrating multiple LLMs and tool integrations is crucial.  Key points for LLM-based multi-agent systems include: using mechanism engineering to represent complex workflows, tooling for interaction with external systems, and orchestration for managing state and chaining LLMs.  The framework encourages considering trade-offs between different implementation approaches at each layer, such as fine-tuning vs. retrieval augmentation for incorporating knowledge, influencing selection of technologies for specific functionalities within a multi-agent system.",
  "takeaways": "This paper's layered architecture provides a valuable blueprint for JavaScript developers building LLM-based multi-agent web apps. Here are some practical examples focusing on different aspects of the architecture:\n\n**1. Model Layer (Data & Training):**\n\n* **Domain-Specific Knowledge Integration:**  Imagine building a customer support chatbot for an e-commerce site. Instead of relying solely on general LLM training, a JavaScript developer can fine-tune a model with product catalogs, FAQs, and past customer interactions. This can be achieved using tools like `LangChain.js` to manage datasets and interact with cloud-based fine-tuning APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic).  The resulting chatbot would possess enhanced product knowledge and handle complex customer queries more effectively.\n* **Bias Mitigation:**  If building a multi-agent news summarization app, it's crucial to minimize bias. A developer can augment the training data with diverse news sources and viewpoints, collaborating with community datasets or dedicated APIs. Using `LangChain.js` to manage this augmented data, they can ensure the news summaries generated by the agents are more balanced and objective.\n\n**2. Inference Layer (Decoding & Efficiency):**\n\n* **Controlled Creativity for Dialogue Agents:**  For a creative writing assistant involving multiple dialogue agents,  a JavaScript developer could implement temperature scaling using libraries like `transformers.js`. Higher temperatures would encourage more diverse and creative dialogue, while lower temperatures ensure more predictable and coherent interactions. This control can be implemented at the agent level, allowing different agents to exhibit varying degrees of creativity.\n* **Structured Output for Agent Communication:**  A multi-agent system for managing smart home devices requires structured communication.  Developers can use constrained decoding with libraries like `HuggingFace.js` or define specific output schemas (JSON, XML) when prompting LLMs. This ensures agents exchange messages in a standardized format, simplifying parsing and execution within the JavaScript application logic.\n* **Speculative Decoding for Real-time Interactions:**  In a multi-agent game, minimizing latency is critical. JavaScript developers can leverage speculative decoding, using smaller, locally hosted \"assistant\" LLMs to predict upcoming agent actions while waiting for the primary LLM's response.  This can significantly enhance real-time responsiveness without sacrificing the primary LLM's intelligence.\n\n**3. Application Layer (Prompting, Mechanisms, Tooling, and Orchestration):**\n\n* **Prompt Engineering for Agent Roles:**  In a collaborative project management app with multiple agents (designer, writer, project manager), prompt engineering is crucial for defining distinct agent roles and behavior. A developer can craft prompts that incorporate role-specific instructions, goals, and constraints. This can be managed dynamically within the JavaScript application using `LangChain.js` to construct and manage prompts based on context and agent type.\n* **Mechanism Engineering for Complex Agent Interactions:** For a multi-agent system simulating a supply chain, the developer can employ mechanism engineering using `LangChain.js` to represent the workflow as a directed acyclic graph (DAG).  Each agent's actions become individual nodes within the DAG, allowing for complex interactions like resource allocation, task delegation, and feedback loops. This provides a structured and maintainable approach to managing complex multi-agent workflows.\n* **Tooling for Agent Access to External Resources:**  In a financial analysis app, agents might need access to real-time stock data or historical market trends. Developers can use tools like `LangChain.js` to integrate with external APIs (e.g., a financial data provider).  They could define specific actions within the agentâ€™s prompt, such as \"GET_STOCK_PRICE(AAPL)\", which triggers a tool call to retrieve data and incorporate it into the agent's analysis.\n* **Orchestration with JavaScript Frameworks:** Frameworks like `Node.js` and associated libraries can handle agent orchestration, managing state, communication, and execution flow.  Developers can define agent behavior, assign roles, monitor interactions, and manage resources using JavaScript code, ensuring robust management of complex multi-agent systems within the web application.\n\nThese examples demonstrate how the layered architecture from the paper can translate into practical JavaScript implementations. By thinking about multi-agent development in terms of layers, developers can make informed design choices, effectively address challenges, and build more sophisticated and robust LLM-powered web applications.  Libraries like `LangChain.js` and `transformers.js` provide valuable building blocks for implementing many of these concepts within a JavaScript environment.",
