  "title": "Simultaneous Computation with Multiple Prioritizations in Multi-Agent Motion Planning",
  "abstract": "Multi-agent path finding (MAPF) in large networks is computationally challenging. An approach for MAPF is prioritized planning (PP), in which agents plan sequentially according to their priority. Albeit a computationally efficient approach for MAPF, the solution quality strongly depends on the prioritization. Most prioritizations rely either on heuristics, which do not generalize well, or iterate to find adequate priorities, which costs computational effort. In this work, we show how agents can compute with multiple prioritizations simultaneously. Our approach is general as it does not rely on domain-specific knowledge. The context of this work is multi-agent motion planning (MAMP) with a receding horizon subject to computation time constraints. MAMP considers the system dynamics in more detail compared to MAPF. In numerical experiments on MAMP, we demonstrate that our approach to prioritization comes close to optimal prioritization and outperforms state-of-the-art methods with only a minor increase in computation time. We show real-time capability in an experiment on a road network with ten vehicles in our Cyber-Physical Mobility Lab.",
  "summary": "This paper tackles the challenge of efficient multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) by proposing a method to compute multiple agent prioritizations simultaneously.  Traditional prioritized planning (PP) assigns priorities to agents (e.g., agent 1 moves before agent 2), but the quality and even existence of solutions heavily depends on this priority order. Testing all possible priority orders is computationally expensive. This work develops a novel approach to compute multiple prioritizations concurrently, improving solution quality without significantly increasing computation time. It uses a \"computation schedule matrix\" similar to a Sudoku puzzle to ensure each agent works on a different prioritization within a given time slot.\n\nFor LLM-based multi-agent systems, this research is relevant for scenarios requiring concurrent execution of multiple agents with dependencies. The proposed method offers a way to explore different execution orders (prioritizations) more efficiently than sequential testing, leading to better coordination and outcomes. This is particularly valuable when agent interactions are complex, mimicking real-world scenarios where determining the optimal interaction order is crucial.  The concept of parallelizing agent computations is relevant for managing multiple LLM agents with limited resources.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents a novel approach to optimizing prioritization in multi-agent planning, particularly relevant for web-based LLM-driven multi-agent applications. Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights:\n\n**1. LLM-Powered Chatbots in Collaborative Environments:**\n\nImagine a customer support scenario with multiple specialized LLM-powered chatbots (e.g., order processing, technical support, billing).  Simultaneous computation with multiple prioritizations can be used to determine which chatbot should respond to a user query first based on factors like urgency, chatbot expertise, and current load.\n\n* **Practical Example:**  Use a message queue (e.g., Redis, RabbitMQ) to handle incoming user queries. A \"prioritization agent\" (a separate process or function) could leverage the paper's algorithm to generate a computation schedule matrix. This matrix defines which prioritization scheme to use for each incoming message. The prioritization schemes themselves could be learned by another LLM or defined based on business rules.  The chosen prioritization determines which chatbot gets the message first. Libraries like `async.js` can manage the asynchronous nature of the chatbot responses.\n\n**2. Real-Time Multi-Agent Simulations in the Browser:**\n\nConsider a browser-based strategy game where multiple LLM agents control units. This paper's approach can improve performance in complex scenarios with many units.\n\n* **Practical Example:** Instead of sequentially calculating each unit's action, group units into classes based on their proximity and potential interaction (using a spatial indexing structure like a quadtree). Use the simultaneous computation algorithm to generate multiple possible action sequences for each class, considering different unit prioritizations within each class. Evaluate these sequences using a heuristic (e.g., damage dealt, territory gained), possibly using another LLM. Choose the best sequence and render it using a JavaScript game engine like Phaser or PixiJS.  TensorFlow.js can be used to manage LLM computations in the browser if needed.\n\n**3. Collaborative Document Editing with LLMs:**\n\nMultiple users, assisted by LLMs, simultaneously edit a document. Conflicts might arise (e.g., concurrent edits to the same sentence). Prioritization can determine which edits take precedence.\n\n* **Practical Example:**  Use a collaborative editing library like Yjs or ProseMirror. When concurrent edits are detected, a prioritization agent, potentially using an LLM trained on conflict resolution, can apply the simultaneous computation algorithm to explore different prioritization schemes based on factors like edit timestamp, user roles, and the semantic importance of the edits. The agent chooses the prioritization that minimizes disruption and maintains document consistency, ensuring a smooth user experience.\n\n**4. Implementing the Algorithm in JavaScript:**\n\nThe core algorithm (Algorithm 2 in the paper) can be implemented as a JavaScript function.  Here's a simplified example:\n\n```javascript\nfunction generateComputationSchedule(agentClasses) {\n  let numClasses = agentClasses.length;\n  let schedule = Array(numClasses).fill(null).map(() => Array(numClasses).fill(null));\n  schedule[0] = [...agentClasses]; // Initial prioritization\n  // ... (Implementation of the remaining algorithm logic) ...\n  return schedule;\n}\n```\n\n\n**Key Takeaways for JavaScript Developers:**\n\n* **Efficiency:**  Simultaneous computation can significantly reduce computation time compared to sequential evaluation of prioritizations, crucial for web applications requiring real-time performance.\n* **Flexibility:** The approach is domain-independent and can be applied to diverse web development scenarios with multiple LLM agents.\n* **Scalability:** The algorithm, while handling factorial complexity, provides a practical approach for a reasonable number of agents and agent classes. Adapting it to handle massive agent populations might require further optimization.\n* **Integration:**  JavaScript's asynchronous nature and existing libraries for message queues, game engines, and collaborative editing make it well-suited for implementing the paper's insights.\n\n\nBy understanding the core concepts and adapting the algorithms to web-specific use cases, JavaScript developers can leverage LLM-powered multi-agent systems effectively, creating more responsive, efficient, and intelligent web applications.",
  "pseudocode": "The provided research paper contains two algorithms described in pseudocode. Here are their JavaScript conversions along with explanations:\n\n**Algorithm 1: Find Agent Classes**\n\n```javascript\nfunction findAgentClasses(directedCouplingGraph) {\n  const V = directedCouplingGraph.vertices;\n  const E = directedCouplingGraph.edges;\n  let Nc = 0; // Number of classes\n  let Vtodo = new Set(V); // Remaining agents\n  const agentClasses = [];\n\n  while (Vtodo.size > 0) {\n    Nc++;\n    let VNc = new Set();\n\n    for (const i of Vtodo) {\n      let incomingEdges = 0;\n      for (const edge of E) {\n        if (edge.target === i) {\n          incomingEdges++;\n        }\n      }\n      if (incomingEdges === 0) { // Source node\n        VNc.add(i);\n      }\n    }\n\n    if (VNc.size === 0) { // No source node found, not a DAG\n      return null; // Or throw an error: \"Graph is not a DAG\"\n    }\n\n    agentClasses.push(Array.from(VNc));\n\n    for (const i of VNc) {\n      Vtodo.delete(i);\n      const newE = [];\n      for(const edge of E) {\n        if(edge.source !== i) {\n          newE.push(edge);\n        }\n      }\n      E.length = 0;\n      E.push(...newE)\n    }\n\n  }\n\n  return agentClasses;\n}\n\n\n// Example usage (refer to Figure 5):\nconst directedCouplingGraph = {\n  vertices: [1, 2, 3, 4],\n  edges: [\n    { source: 1, target: 2 },\n    { source: 1, target: 3 },\n    { source: 2, target: 4 },\n    { source: 3, target: 4 }\n  ]\n};\n\nconst agentClasses = findAgentClasses(directedCouplingGraph);\nconsole.log(agentClasses); // Output: [[1], [2, 3], [4]]\n\n```\n\n* **Explanation:** This algorithm takes a directed coupling graph as input and identifies independent sets of agents (agent classes) that can execute their planning computations in parallel. It uses a topological sorting approach.  It returns an array of agent classes, where each class is an array of agent IDs.  The order of the outer array represents the computation sequence. A `null` return indicates the graph is not a directed acyclic graph (DAG), which is a requirement for prioritized planning.\n\n**Algorithm 2: Decentralized Construction of Computation Schedule Matrix S**\n\n```javascript\nfunction decentralizedComputationSchedule(agentClasses) {\n  const Nc = agentClasses.length;\n  let S = Array(Nc).fill(null).map(() => Array(Nc).fill(null)); // Initialize empty matrix\n  S[0] = [...agentClasses]; // First row is the initial agent class sequence\n  let q = 1; // Current row\n  // Math.seedrandom(currentTimeStep); - replaced due to external dependency, now assuming synchronous execution\n  // in a distributed setting, agents must use a synchronized seed\n\n  while (q < Nc) {\n    let isValid = true;\n    let Ncols_todo = Nc;\n    S[q] = Array(Nc).fill(null);\n\n    while (Ncols_todo > 0) {\n      let options = Array(Nc).fill(null).map(() => new Set(agentClasses));\n\n      for (let m = 0; m < Nc; m++) {\n        for (let i = 0; i <= q; i++) {\n          for (const agent of S[i][m]) { // remove prev used in column and row\n            options[m].delete(agent);\n          }\n        }\n      }\n\n\n      const minOptionsIndex = options.reduce((minIndex, currentSet, currentIndex) => \n        (currentSet.size < options[minIndex].size && currentSet.size>0)? currentIndex : minIndex\n        ,0);\n\n      if (options[minOptionsIndex].size === 0) {\n        isValid = false;\n        break;\n      }\n\n      const randomAgent = Array.from(options[minOptionsIndex])[\n        Math.floor(Math.random() * options[minOptionsIndex].size)\n      ];\n\n      S[q][minOptionsIndex] = randomAgent\n      Ncols_todo--;\n    }\n    if (isValid) {\n      q++;\n    } else {\n        S[q] = Array(Nc).fill(null); // Reset row\n    }\n  }\n\n  return S;\n}\n\n\n\n// Example usage (continuing from Algorithm 1 output):\nconst computationSchedule = decentralizedComputationSchedule(agentClasses);\nconsole.log(computationSchedule);\n```\n\n* **Explanation:** This algorithm constructs a computation schedule matrix `S`,  a Latin square, to enable simultaneous exploration of multiple prioritizations.  Each row in `S` represents a different prioritization (computation sequence), and each column represents a time slot. The algorithm ensures that each agent class is assigned to exactly one time slot per prioritization. The decentralized nature comes from the assumption of synchronized random number generation using the current time step as a seed.  This allows each agent to independently arrive at the same computation schedule.\n\n\nThese JavaScript implementations provide a functional basis for experimenting with the concepts from the paper.  Remember to adapt the data structures and example usage to your specific application scenario.  You will likely need to integrate this with your LLM-based agent logic and a suitable multi-agent communication framework.",
