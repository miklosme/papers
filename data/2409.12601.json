  "title": "Friedkin-Johnsen Model With Diminishing Competition",
  "abstract": "Abstract-This letter studies the Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) model with diminishing competition, or stubbornness. The original FJ model assumes fixed competition that is manifested through a constant weight that each agent gives to its initial opinion in addition to its contribution through a consensus dynamic. This letter investigates the effect of diminishing competition on the convergence point and speed of the FJ dynamics. We show that, if the competition is uniform across agents and vanishes asymptotically, the convergence point coincides with the nominal consensus reached with no competition. However, the diminishing competition slows down convergence according to its own rate of decay. We evaluate this phenomenon analytically and provide upper and lower bounds on the convergence rate. If competition is not uniform across clients, we show that the convergence point may not coincide with the nominal consensus point. Finally, we evaluate and validate our analytical insights numerically.",
  "summary": "This paper investigates how \"stubbornness\" or \"competition\" among agents in a multi-agent system affects their ability to reach consensus (all agents agreeing on a single value). The key finding is that even with diminishing stubbornness, the system can still achieve consensus as long as it fades away over time. This has implications for LLM-based multi-agent systems where agents might have different initial opinions or information, showing that they can still reach an agreement if they gradually become less attached to their initial stances. However, the paper also cautions that if agents reduce their stubbornness at different rates, consensus might not be achievable.",
  "takeaways": "This paper is extremely relevant for JavaScript developers working on LLM-based multi-agent systems, especially in the context of web development. Here's how you can apply the insights:\n\n**Scenario: Building a Collaborative Code Editor with LLMs**\n\nImagine building a Google Docs-like collaborative code editor where multiple developers can edit code simultaneously. LLMs can assist with code completion, error detection, and even suggest code snippets. \n\n**1. Reaching Consensus on Code Changes:**\n\n* **Challenge:**  Multiple LLMs might offer different suggestions, leading to conflicts in the codebase. How do you ensure the system converges on a final, agreed-upon code state?\n* **Solution:**  The Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) model with diminishing competition offers a framework. Treat each LLM as an \"agent\" with an initial \"opinion\" (code suggestion). The weights in the FJ model can represent the \"influence\" or \"reputation\" of each LLM based on past performance or developer trust.\n    * **JavaScript Implementation:** You could use a library like **TensorFlow.js** or **Brain.js** to implement the FJ model. Each LLM agent would update its suggestion based on inputs from other agents and its own confidence (diminishing competition parameter).\n\n**2. Handling Newcomers and Disconnections:**\n\n* **Challenge:**  New developers joining the session or temporary disconnections can disrupt the consensus process.\n* **Solution:** The paper's analysis of convergence rates helps you estimate how quickly the system recovers consensus after a disruption.  This knowledge helps you design mechanisms (e.g., temporary code locks, suggestion prioritization) to minimize disruption for the developers.\n    * **JavaScript Implementation:**  Use **WebSockets** or a library like **Socket.IO** to manage real-time connections and handle dynamic agent additions/removals in your FJ model.\n\n**3. Preventing LLM Domination:**\n\n* **Challenge:** A highly influential LLM might dominate the decision-making, even if its suggestions aren't always optimal.\n* **Solution:**  The paper cautions against non-uniform competition parameters. This means you should avoid giving any single LLM an overwhelmingly high influence, even if it has a good track record. \n    * **JavaScript Implementation:**  Regularly re-evaluate and potentially normalize the influence weights of your LLM agents to prevent a single agent from becoming a bottleneck or a single point of failure.\n\n**JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries**\n\n* **LLM Integration:**  LangChain, Transformers.js\n* **Multi-agent System Frameworks:**  Agent.js, Boids.js (for inspiration)\n* **Real-time Communication:** Socket.IO, WebSockets\n\n**Experimentation Ideas**\n\n* **Varying Influence:**  Experiment with different ways to assign influence to LLMs (e.g., accuracy on benchmark tasks, developer ratings). Observe how consensus dynamics change.\n* **Visualize Convergence:** Create a real-time visualization of the code editor, showing how different LLM suggestions converge over time.\n* **Resilience Testing:** Simulate adversarial scenarios (malfunctioning LLM, malicious code suggestions) and observe how the FJ model with diminishing competition maintains system stability.\n\nBy bridging the gap between multi-agent AI research and practical JavaScript development, you can build more robust and efficient collaborative applications that leverage the power of LLMs.",
