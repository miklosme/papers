  "title": "Multi-Agent Motion Planning For Differential Drive Robots Through Stationary State Search",
  "abstract": "Multi-Agent Motion Planning (MAMP) finds various applications in fields such as traffic management, airport operations, and warehouse automation. In many of these environments, differential drive robots are commonly used. These robots have a kinodynamic model that allows only in-place rotation and movement along their current orientation, subject to speed and acceleration limits. However, existing Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF)-based methods often use simplified models for robot kinodynamics, which limits their practicality and realism. In this paper, we introduce a three-level framework called MASS to address these challenges. MASS combines MAPF-based methods with our proposed stationary state search planner to generate high-quality kinodynamically-feasible plans. We further extend MASS using an adaptive window mechanism to address the lifelong MAMP problem. Empirically, we tested our methods on the single-shot grid map domain and the lifelong warehouse domain. Our method shows up to 400% improvements in terms of throughput compared to existing methods.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces MASS, a new algorithm for coordinating the movement of multiple robots, specifically differential drive robots (like those used in warehouses), within a shared space, ensuring they don't collide and reach their destinations efficiently.  It uses a three-tiered approach: a high-level planner to avoid collisions between robots, a mid-level planner to generate individual robot paths considering their movement limitations (e.g., they can only rotate when stationary), and a low-level planner to optimize the speed and acceleration of each robot along its path. The method is also adapted for long-term, continuous operation where robots receive new goals over time.\n\nWhile not directly addressing LLMs, MASS's hierarchical planning structure, focus on dynamic constraints, and adaptation to lifelong tasks are relevant to LLM-based multi-agent systems. The concept of breaking down complex multi-agent problems into hierarchical levels and focusing on action sequences with constraints parallels the challenges in managing multiple LLM agents collaborating on a shared task.  Furthermore, the adaptive windowing approach in MASS for lifelong tasks offers insights into designing LLM-based agents that can continuously adapt to evolving goals and environmental changes.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents MASS, a multi-agent motion planning framework, particularly relevant for differential drive robots (think of robots moving in a warehouse).  While the paper focuses on robots, its core concepts—specifically, breaking down complex planning into hierarchical levels and optimizing for stationary states—can be valuable for JavaScript developers building LLM-based multi-agent applications for the web. Here's how:\n\n**Practical Examples for JavaScript Developers:**\n\n1. **Multi-Agent Chat Application with Moderation:** Imagine building a chat application where multiple LLM agents interact, each with a specific persona (e.g., a helpful assistant, a creative writer, a debater).  MASS inspires a hierarchical approach:\n\n    * **Level 1 (Global Coordination):** A central agent manages the overall conversation flow, assigns turns, and prevents conflicts (like two agents speaking simultaneously). This could be implemented using Node.js and a message queue like RabbitMQ or Redis for communication between agents.\n\n    * **Level 2 (Individual Agent Action Planning):**  Each LLM agent plans its next action (e.g., generate a response, ask a clarifying question). The \"stationary states\" here could be points where an agent finishes generating text, waits for input, or performs an action other than text generation (like querying a database). This can be implemented using a state machine library like XState or Machina.js within each agent's JavaScript code.\n\n    * **Level 3 (LLM Response Optimization):** At this level, you can fine-tune the LLM's generated response based on various criteria (e.g., length, tone, relevance).  Libraries like LangChain are useful here for managing prompts and LLM interactions.\n\n2. **Collaborative Web Design with AI Agents:** Envision multiple LLM agents designing a webpage together. One agent might specialize in layout, another in content generation, and a third in accessibility.\n\n    * **Level 1 (Design Goal Management):** A manager agent defines the overall design goals and coordinates the other agents' efforts, ensuring consistency and resolving conflicts (e.g., overlapping elements).\n\n    * **Level 2 (Component-Level Planning):**  Individual agents plan how to design their specific component (e.g., generate text for a hero section, create a navigation menu).  \"Stationary states\" could represent completing a design element, waiting for feedback from other agents, or accessing design resources.  A frontend framework like React, along with a state management library like Redux or Zustand, could be used for implementing this level.\n\n    * **Level 3 (Design Refinement):**  Agents refine their designs based on feedback and design principles.  This could involve using JavaScript libraries for design manipulation (e.g., D3.js for visualizations, Fabric.js for canvas manipulation).\n\n3. **Real-time Strategy Game with LLM-Controlled Units:** Consider a web-based RTS game where each unit is controlled by an LLM agent.\n\n    * **Level 1 (Strategic Goal Assignment):** A central AI or the player assigns high-level goals to groups of units (e.g., attack a base, defend a location).\n\n    * **Level 2 (Unit Action Planning):**  Individual units plan their actions (e.g., move to a location, attack an enemy). \"Stationary states\" could represent reaching a destination, completing an attack, or waiting for new orders. This can leverage pathfinding libraries and state machines within the game's JavaScript engine.\n\n    * **Level 3 (Action Execution Optimization):** At this level, the unit’s actions can be refined (e.g. adjusting movement speed based on terrain, predicting enemy movement).\n\n\n**Key JavaScript Technologies:**\n\n* **Node.js:** For backend agent management and communication.\n* **Message Queues (RabbitMQ, Redis):** For inter-agent communication.\n* **State Machine Libraries (XState, Machina.js):** For individual agent behavior.\n* **LLM Interaction Libraries (LangChain):** For managing LLM prompts and responses.\n* **Frontend Frameworks (React, Vue, Angular):** For UI and component management.\n* **State Management Libraries (Redux, Zustand):** For managing shared state in web apps.\n* **Pathfinding Libraries:** For navigation in game-like scenarios.\n\nBy adopting a hierarchical structure similar to MASS and focusing on key decision points (\"stationary states\"), JavaScript developers can build more complex and robust multi-agent web applications powered by LLMs.  This approach provides a structure for managing the interactions and behaviors of numerous agents, leading to more sophisticated and engaging user experiences.",

Unlike traditional SIPP, it focuses on \"stationary states\" (zero velocity) where actions (rotation, movement) transition.  The search uses a lower bound *f*-value (earliest possible arrival time) to prioritize nodes. Partial expansion optimizes the search by delaying the exploration of some branches.\n\n**Algorithm 2: Partial Stationary Expansion**\n\n* **Purpose:** Optimizes the move expansion step in SSIPP by reducing the number of branches explored.\n* **Explanation:** Instead of evaluating all possible move actions and their associated speed profiles at once, partial expansion prioritizes the most promising reachable interval based on a \"p-value\" (lower bound on arrival time through that interval). This reduces computation time, especially in larger maps, while preserving completeness and optimality.\n\n**Algorithm 3: Pseudocode for Windowed-SSIPP**\n\n* **Purpose:** Extends SSIPP to handle lifelong multi-agent planning where agents receive new goals dynamically.\n* **Explanation:** This algorithm adapts SSIPP to work within a rolling horizon framework.  It plans within a time window, using an adaptive window size based on action completion times.  Key differences from SSIPP include the handling of multiple goals sequentially and replanning within episodes.\n\n\n\nThese JavaScript implementations provide a clearer structure for understanding the algorithms and offer a starting point for practical implementation, though the placeholder functions need specific implementations based on environment details and chosen solvers.",
