  "title": "Integration of Large Vision Language Models for Efficient Post-disaster Damage Assessment and Reporting",
  "abstract": "Traditional natural disaster response involves significant coordinated teamwork where speed and efficiency are key. Nonetheless, human limitations can delay critical actions and inadvertently increase human and economic losses. Agentic Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) offer a new avenue to address this challenge, with the potential for substantial socio-economic impact, particularly by improving resilience and resource access in underdeveloped regions. We introduce DisasTeller, the first multi-LVLM-powered framework designed to automate tasks in post-disaster management, including on-site assessment, emergency alerts, resource allocation, and recovery planning. By coordinating four specialised LVLM agents with GPT-4 as the core model, DisasTeller autonomously implements disaster response activities, reducing human execution time and optimising resource distribution. Our evaluations through both LVLMs and humans demonstrate DisasTeller's effectiveness in streamlining disaster response. This framework not only supports expert teams but also simplifies access to disaster management processes for non-experts, bridging the gap between traditional response methods and LVLM-driven efficiency.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces DisasTeller, a multi-agent framework using Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) like GPT-4 to automate post-disaster tasks like damage assessment, alerts, resource allocation, and recovery planning. Each agent specializes in a specific role (expert, alerts, emergency, assignment) coordinating with each other.  Key points relevant to LLM-based multi-agent systems include demonstrating the potential for LVLMs to autonomously collaborate, streamlining complex processes; highlighting challenges like \"hallucinations\" and data security; emphasizing the importance of prompt engineering for reliable output; and showing the need for robust evaluation metrics for LVLM-based systems and real-time integration with data sources.",
  "takeaways": "This paper introduces DisasTeller, a multi-LVLM framework for disaster response.  While the context is disaster management, the underlying multi-agent architecture and the challenges it presents are highly relevant to JavaScript developers building any kind of LLM-based multi-agent application.  Here are some practical examples of how a JavaScript developer could apply these insights to their projects:\n\n**1. Defining Agent Roles and Interactions (LangChain, CrewAI):**\n\n* **Concept:** DisasTeller uses distinct LLM agents with specialized roles (expert, alerts, emergency, assignment).  This modularity improves organization and allows for targeted prompt engineering.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * Use LangChain to define chains for each agent, specifying their individual prompts and functionalities. This allows for easy chaining of agents, where the output of one agent becomes the input of another.\n    * Employ CrewAI to manage agent communication and orchestration. CrewAI simplifies agent interactions by providing built-in mechanisms for message passing and task assignment.\n\n```javascript\n// Example using LangChain (simplified)\nconst expertAgentChain = new LLMChain({ llm, prompt: expertPrompt });\nconst alertsAgentChain = new LLMChain({ llm, prompt: alertsPrompt });\n\nconst expertOutput = await expertAgentChain.call({ input });\nconst alertsOutput = await alertsAgentChain.call({ input: expertOutput });\n\n\n//Conceptual example using CrewAI\n//Agent definitions using custom javascript classes or functions\nfunction expertAgent(message){/* process message */}\nfunction alertsAgent(message){/* process message */}\n//Register agents to allow for communication through an intermediary message bus\ncrew.registerAgent(\"expert\",expertAgent)\ncrew.registerAgent(\"alerts\",alertsAgent)\n//send messages via crew.send()\n```\n\n\n**2. Handling Intermediate Outputs and Tool Usage (LangChain):**\n\n* **Concept:** DisasTeller stores intermediate outputs in memory, enabling agents to reuse information and access tools.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** Leverage LangChain's `Memory` feature to store and retrieve intermediate outputs between agents.  Integrate external tools (e.g., map APIs, data analysis libraries) using LangChain's tool integration capabilities.\n\n```javascript\nconst memory = new ConversationBufferMemory();\n\nconst chain1 = new LLMChain({ llm, prompt: prompt1, memory });\nconst result1 = await chain1.call({ input });\n\nconst chain2 = new LLMChain({ llm, prompt: prompt2, memory });\nconst result2 = await chain2.call({ input: result1 });\n\n```\n\n\n**3. Mitigating Hallucinations:**\n\n* **Concept:** The paper acknowledges the risk of LLM hallucinations.  It proposes using real-time data and peer-review systems to mitigate this.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * Integrate with external data sources (e.g., using fetch API or specific libraries for APIs like Google Maps) to provide grounded information to the agents.\n    * Implement a human-in-the-loop system where critical agent outputs are reviewed by humans before being acted upon.\n\n```javascript\n// Example using fetch to get real-time data\nconst realTimeData = await fetch(\"api_endpoint\").then(res => res.json());\n\nconst llmInput = { ...userInput, realTimeData };\n```\n\n\n\n**4. Addressing Data Privacy and Security:**\n\n* **Concept:** The paper emphasizes the importance of data privacy and security in multi-agent systems.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**  Utilize secure authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., OAuth, JWT). Encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest.  Consider differential privacy techniques when sharing data with LLMs.\n\n\n\n\n**5. Framework Choice:**\n\n* While the paper doesn't use a specific framework, a JavaScript developer can build a similar system using:\n    * **LangChain:** For chaining LLMs, managing memory, and incorporating tools.\n    * **CrewAI:** For agent orchestration and communication.\n    * **Node.js:** As the backend environment to manage server-side logic.\n    * **React, Vue, or Angular:** To create user interfaces for interacting with the multi-agent system.\n\n\n\n\nBy understanding and applying these concepts, JavaScript developers can build robust, reliable, and ethical LLM-based multi-agent systems for various web applications, learning valuable lessons from DisasTeller's disaster management focus.",
