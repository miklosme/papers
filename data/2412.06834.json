  "title": "Investigating social alignment via mirroring in a system of interacting language models",
  "abstract": "Alignment is a social phenomenon wherein individuals share a common goal or perspective. Mirroring, or mimicking the behaviors and opinions of another individual, is one mechanism by which individuals can become aligned. Large-scale investigations of the effect of mirroring on alignment have been limited due to the scalability of traditional experimental designs in sociology. In this paper, we introduce a simple computational framework that enables studying the effect of mirroring behavior on alignment in multi-agent systems. We simulate systems of interacting large language models in this framework and characterize overall system behavior and alignment with quantitative measures of agent dynamics. We find that system behavior is strongly influenced by the range of communication of each agent and that these effects are exacerbated by increased rates of mirroring. We discuss the observed simulated system behavior in the context of known human social dynamics. A key phenomenon underlying the formation of human groups is social alignment (Ransom et al., 2019). This phenomenon, through which individuals adopt the behaviors of the individuals they interact with, has been shown to support the creation of social relationships through the promotion of positive commonality (Burton-Jones et al., 2020). In short, like attracts like, and it is through social alignment that individuals behave more alike one another in order to foster cohesive relationships. One of the most direct mechanisms to achieve social alignment is social mirroring (Hasson and Frith, 2016). This occurs primarily subconsciously, as individuals will mimic (or mirror) the facial expressions, posture, mannerisms, and other behaviors of those with whom they interact (Tunçgenç et al., 2022). However, social mirroring is not limited to physical mimicry, as it can also include a more complete degree of copying wherein individuals parrot speech patterns, opinions, and perspectives of those they are mirroring to appear maximally agreeable (Byrne, 2005). While social mirroring has been studied extensively in small group conditions – primarily with respect to one-on-one interacting pairs (Gallotti et al., 2017) – little research has been done exploring its system-level consequences, primarily due to the infeasibility of large-scale experiments. Instead, system-level social science research has been predominantly concerned with the broad consequences of social alignment in group performance once a group has already been established (Ledgerwood and Wang, 2018), rather than the decentralized processes from which those groups can emerge. Previous theoretical work exploring foundational human social behaviors has been conducted through either purely mathematical means such as the long-tested voter model of population dynamics (Redner, 2019) or via overly simple computational frameworks (Yang et al., 2021). While these approaches can produce excellent insights into the general social dynamics of a population, recent advances in machine learning techniques have enabled explorations of classic economic, psycholinguistic, and social psychology experiments. For example, the recent cohort of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI’s GPT4, are able to replicate the Ultimatum Game, Garden Path Sentences, and Milgram Shock Experiment (Aher et al., 2023). Although recent LLMs are able to generate human-like outputs (Webb et al., 2023; Helm et al., 2023) and replicate classic experiments without explicit training (see, e.g., (Webb et al., 2023)), human-like behavior is not sufficient to model individuals in a social system. Indeed, it is necessary to have generative variation across agents that effectively mimics cognitive differences across people.",
  "summary": "This paper investigates how \"mirroring\" (adopting others' behaviors and opinions) affects alignment (sharing common goals/perspectives) in multi-agent systems.  Using simulated interacting LLMs, they found that an agent's communication range and the likelihood of mirroring heavily influence system-level alignment.  Restricted communication leads to stable but isolated groups (like echo chambers), while widespread communication with high mirroring rates hinders global consensus, leading to unstable, fragmented groups due to delayed convergence of opinions.  This highlights how information exposure and mirroring interact to shape polarization and consensus formation in multi-agent systems.",
  "takeaways": "This research paper explores social alignment and mirroring within a multi-agent system comprised of LLMs. Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply its insights to LLM-based multi-agent projects, focusing on web development scenarios:\n\n**1. Simulating Social Alignment and Mirroring:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Develop a collaborative writing application where multiple LLM agents assist users in generating diverse story ideas.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * Use a JavaScript LLM library like `langchain` or a cloud-based LLM API to instantiate multiple agents.\n    * Represent each agent's \"knowledge base\" (akin to the paper's RAG database) with a unique JavaScript object or array storing relevant text excerpts.  These could be pulled from a vector database like Pinecone or Weaviate.\n    * Implement the mirroring mechanism described in the paper. When agents interact, based on a probability `p`, one agent's internal state (its knowledge base) is updated with the content of the other.\n    * Use cosine similarity (easily calculable with libraries like `ml5.js` or `vector-similarity`) between the LLM-generated text embeddings to measure alignment, mimicking the paper's measurement step.\n    * Adjust `p` (mirroring probability) and `k` (communication range, i.e., number of nearby agents considered for interaction) to observe their impact on the generated story ideas.  Visualize the silo formation using a JavaScript charting library like Chart.js or D3.js.\n\n**2. Moderating Online Discussions:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Build a multi-agent system to facilitate healthy online discussions, minimizing echo chambers and promoting diverse perspectives.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * Deploy LLM agents as discussion moderators.\n    * Use the concept of \"communication range\" (`k`) to control which comments an agent considers when generating its responses.  A smaller `k` could restrict an agent to a local thread, while a larger `k` could allow it to consider the entire discussion.\n    * Introduce a \"mirroring prevention\" mechanism. If an agent detects high similarity between its generated response and existing comments (using sentence similarity calculations), it could re-prompt the LLM to explore alternative viewpoints, reducing the likelihood of reinforcing existing opinions.\n\n**3. Collaborative Design Tools:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Create a multi-agent design tool where LLMs assist users in brainstorming and refining design concepts.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * Each LLM agent could represent a different design persona (e.g., \"minimalist,\" \"futuristic,\" \"practical\").\n    * Implement the paper's interaction and mirroring mechanisms. Allow agents to \"exchange information\" (design ideas represented as text or code) and potentially \"mirror\" successful design patterns from each other.\n    * Monitor the alignment between the agents' outputs (using similarity metrics) to gauge the convergence or divergence of design concepts. A front-end JavaScript framework like React, Vue, or Svelte could be used to dynamically display design ideas as they evolve.\n\n**4. Personalized Recommendations:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  Develop a personalized recommendation system where LLMs interact to generate diverse recommendations tailored to individual user preferences.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * Each agent could represent a different aspect of user preferences (e.g., \"price sensitivity,\" \"brand loyalty,\" \"novelty seeking\").\n    *  Agents interact and potentially mirror each other based on the similarity of user profiles. This can lead to more diverse recommendations by avoiding over-reliance on a single preference dimension.\n\n**Key JavaScript Libraries and Frameworks:**\n\n* **LLM Interaction:** `langchain`, OpenAI API, Cohere API, Hugging Face Inference API.\n* **Vector Databases:** Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma.\n* **Similarity Measures:** `ml5.js`, `vector-similarity`.\n* **Visualization:** Chart.js, D3.js.\n* **Front-end Frameworks:** React, Vue, Svelte.\n\nBy using these techniques, JavaScript developers can leverage the insights of the paper to create dynamic and engaging multi-agent web applications that go beyond simple LLM integration and incorporate more complex social dynamics.  Remember to consider the ethical implications of using LLMs in these contexts, particularly with respect to bias amplification and echo chamber formation.  Carefully tuning `p` and `k` as described in the paper is critical to navigating these issues.",
  "pseudocode": "No pseudocode block found. However, the paper describes algorithms related to agent interaction and database updates which can be represented in JavaScript.  While the paper doesn't explicitly provide pseudocode, I can extrapolate the described processes into JavaScript functions based on the descriptions provided.\n\n**1. Agent Interaction and Mirroring:**\n\n```javascript\nasync function interact(agentA, agentB, p) {\n  // Get the prettiest flower descriptions from both agents\n  const flowerA = await agentA.getFlowerDescription();\n  const flowerB = await agentB.getFlowerDescription();\n\n  // Determine if mirroring occurs\n  const mirror = Math.random() < p;\n\n  if (mirror) {\n      // Agent B mirrors agent A\n      await agentB.updateDatabase(flowerA);\n  } else {\n      // Agent B updates with its own answer (no mirroring)\n      await agentA.updateDatabase(flowerB);\n  }\n}\n\n\n// Example usage (assuming agentA and agentB are objects with appropriate methods):\n\ninteract(agentA, agentB, 0.5); // 50% chance of mirroring\n```\n\n**Explanation:** This function simulates the interaction between two agents, `agentA` and `agentB`. The `p` parameter controls the probability of mirroring. If mirroring occurs, `agentB` updates its database with `agentA`'s flower description. Otherwise, `agentA` updates its database with `agentB`'s description, representing information exchange without alignment. The `async/await` syntax is used to handle potential asynchronous operations like database queries by the agents.\n\n\n**2. Database Update:**\n\n```javascript\n// Method within the agent object (e.g., agentA, agentB)\nasync updateDatabase(newFlowerDescription) {\n  this.database.push(newFlowerDescription);\n  // Additional logic for database management could be added here (e.g., limiting database size)\n}\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:** This function adds the new flower description to the agent's database.  This would typically be a method within a larger agent class. Additional logic can be implemented to manage database size, recency of information, or other relevant factors.\n\n**3. K-Nearest Neighbors Selection:**\n\nThis part requires some external dependencies or custom implementation for distance calculation and sorting. Assuming a function `calculateDistance(flowerA, flowerB)`  that returns the semantic distance between flower descriptions and an array `agents` containing all agents, the k-nearest neighbors selection can be implemented as:\n\n```javascript\n\nfunction selectKNearestNeighbors(targetAgent, agents, k) {\n    const distances = agents.filter(agent => agent !== targetAgent) // Exclude self\n        .map(agent => ({ agent: agent, distance: calculateDistance(targetAgent.currentFlower, agent.currentFlower)}))\n        .sort((a, b) => a.distance - b.distance);\n\n\n    return distances.slice(0, k).map(neighbor => neighbor.agent);\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:** This function calculates distances between a `targetAgent` and all other agents, sorts them in ascending order, and returns the top `k` agents as an array.\n\n**Note:** These JavaScript snippets are simplified implementations based on the concepts described in the paper.  A complete multi-agent system implementation using LLMs would require integration with an LLM API, robust database management, and more sophisticated agent representations.  The functions illustrate the core algorithmic logic for agent interaction and database updating within a simplified context.",
