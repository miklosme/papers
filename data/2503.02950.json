  "title": "LiteWebAgent: The Open-Source Suite for VLM-Based Web-Agent Applications",
  "abstract": "We introduce LiteWebAgent, an open-source suite for VLM-based web agent applications. LiteWebAgent addresses a critical gap in the web agent ecosystem by providing an extensible core agent framework featuring planning, memory, and tree search capabilities, alongside a production-ready solution that combines minimal serverless backend configuration and intuitive user and browser interfaces. For the core LiteWebAgent agent framework, we implemented a simple yet effective baseline using recursive function calling, providing decoupled action generation and action grounding. In addition, we integrate advanced research components such as agent planning, agent workflow memory, and tree search in a modular and extensible manner. We then integrate the LiteWebAgent agent framework with frontend and backend systems in two deployment formats: (1) a production Vercel-based web application that provides users with an agent-controlled remote browser, and (2) a Chrome extension that leverages LiteWebAgent's API to control an existing Chrome browser via CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol). The core LiteWebAgent framework is available at https://github.com/PathOnAI/LiteWebAgent, with deployed frontend at https://lite-web-agent.vercel.app/.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces LiteWebAgent, an open-source toolkit for building VLM-based web agents.  It simplifies the development and deployment of agents capable of automating tasks within a web browser. Key features relevant to LLM-based multi-agent systems include: a decoupled architecture for action generation and grounding, integration of planning and memory mechanisms, support for tree search algorithms (BFS, DFS, MCTS), and flexible deployment options (Vercel app and Chrome extension) facilitating multi-agent interactions within web environments.",
  "takeaways": "This paper introduces LiteWebAgent, a valuable tool for JavaScript developers exploring LLM-based multi-agent systems in web development. Here's how its insights can be applied practically:\n\n**1. Decoupled Action Generation and Grounding:**\n\n* **Practical Example:** Imagine building a multi-agent system for e-commerce where one agent browses products and another adds them to a cart.  Using JavaScript and a library like Playwright, the \"browsing agent\" can generate actions like \"click the 'Next Page' button\" or \"click on the product titled 'Blue Widget'\".  A separate grounding function, also in JavaScript, would translate these natural language actions into Playwright commands: `page.click('text=Next Page')` or `page.click('text=Blue Widget')`. This decoupling simplifies agent design and allows easy integration of new functionalities.\n* **Benefit:** Makes the system more maintainable and allows specialized grounding functions for different agents or web platforms.\n\n**2. Agent Planning and Memory:**\n\n* **Practical Example:** Consider an agent tasked with booking a flight. You can use JavaScript to implement the planning logic. The agent's plan, stored as a JavaScript array, might initially be:  `[\"Search for flights\", \"Select departure date\", \"Select return date\", \"Choose a flight\", \"Enter passenger details\", \"Confirm booking\"]`.  The agent workflow memory (AWM), also implemented as a JavaScript object, can store past booking experiences to inform the current plan, e.g., preferred airlines or seating preferences.\n* **Benefit:** Enables more complex, multi-step tasks. AWM improves agent performance by learning from past interactions.\n\n**3. Tree Search:**\n\n* **Practical Example:**  In a game-playing web agent, tree search can be used to explore possible moves.  A JavaScript implementation of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) could explore different game actions (clicking buttons, entering text), evaluating their outcomes using a VLM-based value function.  The agent then selects the action leading to the most promising branch of the search tree.\n* **Benefit:** Allows the agent to consider future consequences of its actions, leading to better decision-making.\n\n**4. Synchronous and Asynchronous APIs:**\n\n* **Practical Example:** A multi-agent web app using Node.js and Express.js can use asynchronous API calls to manage communication between agents. One agent can send a message to another using an asynchronous API call.  The receiving agent can then process the message and respond asynchronously. This prevents blocking operations and enhances performance.\n* **Benefit:**  Improved responsiveness and scalability of the multi-agent system, particularly for real-time interactions.\n\n**5. Flexible User Interface:**\n\n* **Practical Example:** Use React or Vue.js to build a user interface that visualizes the agent's actions and allows users to interact with the system. The interface could display the agent's current plan, the actions it is taking, and the results of those actions. Users could also provide input to the agent through the interface, e.g., by clarifying the goal or correcting errors.\n* **Benefit:** Enhances user understanding and control over the multi-agent system.\n\n\n**JavaScript Libraries and Frameworks:**\n\n* **Playwright/Puppeteer:**  For controlling the browser and simulating user interactions.\n* **LangChain:** For interacting with LLMs and managing prompts.\n* **TensorFlow.js:** For implementing VLM-based value functions or other machine learning components.\n* **React/Vue.js:** For building user interfaces.\n* **Node.js/Express.js:** For building server-side logic and APIs.\n\n\nBy combining these insights and tools, JavaScript developers can effectively build and deploy sophisticated LLM-based multi-agent systems for a variety of web applications, from e-commerce and gaming to automated testing and customer support. LiteWebAgent provides a solid foundation for such projects, simplifying many of the technical challenges involved.",
