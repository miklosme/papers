  "title": "Goal Recognition using Actor-Critic Optimization",
  "abstract": "Goal Recognition aims to infer an agent's goal from a sequence of observations. Existing approaches often rely on manually engineered domains and discrete representations. Deep Recognition using Actor-Critic Optimization (DRACO) is a novel approach based on deep reinforcement learning that overcomes these limitations by providing two key contributions. First, it is the first goal recognition algorithm that learns a set of policy networks from unstructured data and uses them for inference. Second, DRACO introduces new metrics for assessing goal hypotheses through continuous policy representations. DRACO achieves state-of-the-art performance for goal recognition in discrete settings while not using the structured inputs used by existing approaches. Moreover, it outperforms these approaches in more challenging, continuous settings at substantially reduced costs in both computing and memory. Together, these results showcase the robustness of the new algorithm, bridging traditional goal recognition and deep reinforcement learning.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces DRACO (Deep Recognition using Actor-Critic Optimization), a novel method for Goal Recognition (GR) that uses deep reinforcement learning to infer an agent's goal from its observed actions.  Unlike traditional symbolic GR, DRACO handles continuous state/action spaces and noisy data by learning goal-conditioned policies directly from environment interaction data.  It replaces costly real-time planning with learned neural networks representing potential agent behaviors for different goals.  For comparison, the likelihood of observed actions given a goal is estimated using two new metrics derived from Wasserstein distance and Z-score.\n\nKey points relevant to LLM-based multi-agent systems: DRACO demonstrates a move away from symbolic reasoning in multi-agent systems towards data-driven approaches. This aligns with the strengths of LLMs, which excel at learning from data.  The concept of learning goal-conditioned policies, analogous to agents learning specific behaviors for different objectives, is highly relevant.  The use of distance metrics to compare observed behavior to learned policies offers a potential mechanism for evaluating LLM-generated agent actions against expected behavior. The focus on robustness to noise and incomplete information is also crucial for real-world LLM agent deployments.",
  "takeaways": "This paper introduces DRACO, a novel approach to Goal Recognition (GR) using deep reinforcement learning, particularly relevant for JavaScript developers building LLM-based multi-agent web applications. Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights:\n\n**1. LLM-based Agent Goal Inference:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine a collaborative web application where multiple LLM-powered agents (e.g., chatbots, virtual assistants) interact.  Understanding their individual goals is crucial for coordination and conflict resolution.\n* **Implementation:** DRACO's core concept involves learning goal-conditioned policies. You can train a separate LLM for each potential goal, representing different agent behaviors. The LLM's output (e.g., text responses, actions) becomes the policy.  When observing an agent's actions in the web application, compare these actions to the learned policies using the Wasserstein or Z-score distance metrics. The closest policy indicates the agent's likely goal.  Libraries like TensorFlow.js or PyTorch.js can handle the neural network aspects, and math.js or similar libraries can be used for metric calculations.\n\n```javascript\n// Example (simplified): Using TensorFlow.js and math.js\n\n// Assuming 'llm_goal1' and 'llm_goal2' are trained LLMs for two different goals\n// 'observedActions' are the actions of the agent we're observing\n\nconst output_goal1 = llm_goal1.predict(currentState); //  LLM predicts action given current state\nconst output_goal2 = llm_goal2.predict(currentState);\n\n\nconst wassersteinDistance1 = math.wassersteinDistance(observedActions, output_goal1);\nconst wassersteinDistance2 = math.wassersteinDistance(observedActions, output_goal2);\n\n\nif (wassersteinDistance1 < wassersteinDistance2) {\n  console.log(\"Agent likely pursuing Goal 1\");\n} else {\n  console.log(\"Agent likely pursuing Goal 2\");\n}\n```\n\n**2. Dynamic Content Adaptation:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  A website personalizes content based on user behavior. Multi-agent systems can dynamically adjust the content based on inferred user goals.\n* **Implementation:**  Treat user interactions (clicks, scrolls, dwell time) as observations. Train LLMs to generate different content variations for different user goals (e.g., researching a product, making a purchase). DRACO's distance metrics can help infer the user's goal in real-time, allowing the multi-agent system to serve the most relevant content dynamically using a JavaScript framework like React or Vue.js.\n\n**3. Enhanced Chatbot Interactions:**\n\n* **Scenario:** An LLM-powered chatbot assists users with complex tasks (e.g., booking a flight, filing a support ticket). Understanding the user's ultimate goal improves the chatbot's effectiveness.\n* **Implementation:** Use DRACO to infer user goals based on their conversation history and actions within the web application. This inferred goal can guide the chatbot's responses, pre-fill forms, or offer proactive suggestions. Libraries like LangChain.js can be integrated to manage the LLM interaction within the web application.\n\n**4. Decentralized Multi-Agent Coordination:**\n\n* **Scenario:** A web application uses multiple LLM-powered agents to manage different aspects of a complex task. These agents need to coordinate their actions without a central controller.\n* **Implementation:**  Each agent can use DRACO to infer the goals of other agents based on their observed actions.  This shared understanding of goals enables decentralized coordination.  The agents can then adjust their own actions to contribute to the overall task completion, using message passing between agents via a library like Socket.IO.\n\n**Key JavaScript Considerations:**\n\n* **Data Representation:** Choose an appropriate data format (e.g., vectors, text embeddings) to represent agent actions and states for compatibility with LLMs and distance calculations.\n* **Asynchronous Operations:** Use asynchronous JavaScript patterns (Promises, async/await) to manage LLM predictions and goal inference efficiently.\n* **Performance Optimization:** Consider using web workers or serverless functions to offload computationally intensive LLM operations and improve web application responsiveness.\n\n\nBy adopting DRACO's principles, JavaScript developers can build more intelligent and adaptive multi-agent web applications that are better equipped to understand and respond to user needs and agent interactions. This paves the way for more sophisticated and user-centric web experiences.",
  "pseudocode": "No pseudocode block found. However, the paper describes algorithms and mathematical formulas which can be translated into JavaScript. Specifically:\n\n**1. Reward Function (Equation 1):**\n\n```javascript\nfunction calculateReward(state, action, goal) {\n  // Assuming state, action, and goal are represented as arrays or objects with numerical properties.\n  let distance = 0;\n  for (let key in action) { // Or iterate through array indices\n    distance += Math.abs(action[key] - goal[key]); // L1 norm (Manhattan distance)\n  }\n  return -1 * distance;\n}\n\nlet state = { x: 1, y: 2 };  // Example state\nlet action = { dx: 0.5, dy: 1 }; // Example action\nlet goal = { x: 2, y: 4 }; // Example goal\n\nlet reward = calculateReward(state, action, goal);\nconsole.log(\"Reward:\", reward); // Output will vary based on state, action, and goal.\n```\n*Explanation:* This function calculates the reward for a given state and action based on the distance from the goal. The closer the action takes the agent toward the goal, the higher (less negative) the reward.\n\n**2. State-Only Distance (Equation 4):**\n\n```javascript\nfunction calculateStateOnlyDistance(observations, valueFunction) {\n  // observations: Array of states\n  // valueFunction: A function that takes a state and returns its value (from the critic network)\n  let totalValue = 0;\n  for (let state of observations) {\n    totalValue += valueFunction(state);\n  }\n  return 1 / totalValue; // Note: Paper has a typo, it should be 1 divided by the sum.\n}\n```\n*Explanation:* This function calculates the distance of a sequence of observed states from a goal based on the values returned by a pre-trained value function (critic network in the paper's context).\n\n\n**3. Wasserstein Distance (Equation 6 and 7):**\n\n```javascript\nfunction wassersteinDistance(state, action, policy) {\n  // policy: A function that takes a state and returns a sampled action\n  let sampledAction = policy(state);\n  let distance = 0;\n  for (let key in action) { // Assuming action and sampledAction have the same properties.\n    distance += Math.abs(action[key] - sampledAction[key]); // L1 norm\n  }\n  return distance;\n}\n\nfunction wassersteinDistanceSequence(observations, policy) {\n  let distances = [];\n  for (let observation of observations) {\n     distances.push(wassersteinDistance(observation.state, observation.action, policy));\n  }\n\n  // Calculate the mean of the distances \n  const sum = distances.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);\n  const mean = (sum / distances.length) || 0; // Handle empty array case.\n  return mean;\n}\n```\n*Explanation:* The `wassersteinDistance` function computes the L1 distance between a single observed action and a sampled action from the policy. The `wassersteinDistanceSequence` function computes this over an entire observation sequence and returns the mean distance.\n\n**4. Z-Score Distance (Equation 8 and 9):**\n\n```javascript\nfunction zScore(state, action, policy) {\n  // policy: A function that takes a state and returns an object with mean and std properties.\n  let policyStats = policy(state); //  { mean: ..., std: ... }\n  let z = 0;\n  for (let key in action) { // Iterating over action dimensions\n    z += Math.abs(action[key] - policyStats.mean[key]) / policyStats.std[key];\n  }\n  return z;\n}\n\nfunction zScoreSequence(observations, policy) {\n  let zScores = [];\n  for (let observation of observations) {\n    zScores.push(zScore(observation.state, observation.action, policy));\n  }\n  // Calculate the mean of the z-scores\n  const sum = zScores.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);\n  const mean = (sum / zScores.length) || 0;  // Handle empty array case.\n\n  return mean;\n}\n\n```\n*Explanation:* The `zScore` function calculates how many standard deviations away an observed action is from the policy's mean action for a given state. The `zScoreSequence` function computes this across a sequence of observations and returns the mean.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* These JavaScript snippets provide the core logic based on the provided equations.  You would need to adapt them based on how you represent states, actions, goals, policies, and value functions within your JavaScript environment.\n* The paper describes using Actor-Critic methods and neural networks for learning policies, but does not provide the implementation details of these networks.  You would need to choose an appropriate deep learning framework (like TensorFlow.js or Brain.js) to implement these networks in JavaScript.\n* The paper emphasizes the flexibility of DRACO in handling continuous action and state spaces.  When working with continuous spaces, you would use appropriate numerical representation and distance metrics in your JavaScript implementation.\n\n\nThese JavaScript implementations and explanations can empower software engineers to explore and experiment with the DRACO approach to Goal Recognition. They bridge the gap between academic research and practical implementation using JavaScript, fostering further innovation in web-based multi-agent systems.",
