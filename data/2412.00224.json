  "title": "An AI-Driven Data Mesh Architecture Enhancing Decision-Making in Infrastructure Construction and Public Procurement",
  "abstract": "Abstract-Infrastructure construction, often referred to as an \"industry of industries\" is deeply intertwined with government spending and public procurement, offering immense potential for enhanced efficiency and productivity through improved transparency and access to foundational information. By capitalizing on this potential, we can achieve significant productivity gains, cost savings, and positive economic impacts across the broader economy. Recognizing this opportunity, we introduce an integrated software ecosystem combining Data Mesh and Service Mesh architecture that encompasses the largest training data for infrastructure, procurement, scientific publications, activities and risk information with 100B+ tokens along with a systematic AI framework. Our system, underpinned by a Knowledge Graph linked to multi-agents for domain-specific tasks and Q&A capabilities. By standardizing and ingesting data from diverse sources, we transform raw data into structured knowledge. Leveraging large language models (LLMs) and automation, our system sets new standards for data structuring and automated knowledge creation, assisting in decision-making for early-stage project planning, in-depth project research, market trend analysis, and qualitative assessments. The web-scalable architecture streams domain-curated information, providing a foundation for AI agents to facilitate reasoning and uncertainty elicitation, and supporting future expansions through specialized agents for specific challenges. By systematically integrating AI with industry domain knowledge, this work not only enhances efficiency and decision-making in the construction and infrastructure sectors but also lays a foundation for addressing broader government efficiency. We believe this work will contribute significantly to future AI-driven endeavors in this industry and inform best practices in AI Ops, accelerating the transformation of any analog industry to digital workflows.",
  "summary": "This paper proposes an AI-driven system for the construction and infrastructure sectors, addressing inefficiencies in data management and decision-making. It uses a \"Data Mesh\" to standardize data from diverse sources and a \"Service Mesh\" to manage microservices.  A \"Knowledge Graph\" structures this data, while a multi-agent system, incorporating LLMs, performs tasks like project summarization, risk analysis, and technical research.  Key to the LLM-based multi-agent system is the integration of uncertainty modeling to improve the reliability of insights, dynamic updates from web and journal sources, and flexible invocation of different LLMs (including RAG configurations) based on specific agent needs.  The system aims to provide real-time, data-driven insights for improved project management and strategic planning within the industry.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents an AI-driven data mesh architecture for infrastructure and public procurement, offering many opportunities for LLM-based multi-agent application development in JavaScript. Here are practical examples:\n\n**1. Multi-Agent Project Research & Summarization:**\n\n* **Scenario:** A web app for construction project research, summarizing key information from various sources.\n* **Agents:**\n    * **Retrieval Agent:** Uses LangChain's `loadSummarizationChain` with an LLM like GPT-4 to summarize project descriptions from official websites and news articles.\n    * **Risk Assessment Agent:** Analyzes project data (cost, timelines) and external factors (economic indicators) to assess risk using a JavaScript library like TensorFlow.js for prediction models.\n    * **Comparable Project Agent:** Searches the data mesh for similar projects based on attributes like location, sector, and budget, using a similarity library like Fuse.js.\n* **Implementation:**\n```javascript\n// Retrieval Agent using LangChain (simplified)\nconst chain = loadSummarizationChain(llm, { type: 'map_reduce' });\nconst res = await chain.call({ input_documents: documents });\nconsole.log(res.text);\n\n// Risk Assessment Agent using TensorFlow.js (conceptual)\nconst model = await tf.loadLayersModel('risk_model.json');\nconst prediction = model.predict(inputData);\n\n// Comparable Project Agent using Fuse.js\nconst fuse = new Fuse(projects, { keys: ['location', 'sector'] });\nconst results = fuse.search(query);\n```\n\n**2. Multi-Modal Data Visualization & Analysis:**\n\n* **Scenario:** A dashboard visualizing project timelines, budget allocations, and geographical risk factors.\n* **Agents:**\n    * **Data Aggregation Agent:** Collects data from the data mesh using API calls, filtering by user-selected criteria (location, sector).\n    * **Visualization Agent:** Uses a JavaScript charting library like Chart.js or D3.js to create interactive visualizations of project timelines, budget breakdowns, and geographical risk heatmaps.\n    * **Analysis Agent:** Performs trend analysis on time-series project data, using a JavaScript statistical library like Simple Statistics.\n* **Implementation:**\n```javascript\n// Visualization Agent using Chart.js\nconst chart = new Chart(ctx, {\n  type: 'line',\n  data: {\n    labels: timelines,\n    datasets: [{ label: 'Budget', data: allocations }]\n  }\n});\n\n// Analysis Agent using Simple Statistics\nconst trend = ss.linearRegression(data);\n```\n\n**3. Real-time Project Tracking & Alerts:**\n\n* **Scenario:** A system tracking project status changes and sending alerts to stakeholders via email or in-app notifications.\n* **Agents:**\n    * **Monitoring Agent:** Polls the data mesh for updates on project status, timelines, or budget changes.\n    * **Alert Agent:**  Triggers email or in-app notifications using Nodemailer or a notification library based on pre-defined thresholds or user preferences.\n* **Implementation:**\n```javascript\n// Monitoring Agent (conceptual)\nsetInterval(async () => {\n  const updates = await fetchDataMeshUpdates();\n  if (updates) {\n    alertAgent.triggerAlerts(updates);\n  }\n}, pollingInterval);\n\n\n// Alert Agent using Nodemailer (simplified)\nconst transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({ /* ... */ });\ntransporter.sendMail({ /* ... */ });\n```\n\n**4. Interactive Chatbot for Project Information:**\n\n* **Scenario:** A chatbot allowing users to ask questions about projects and receive summarized information.\n* **Agents:**\n    * **Natural Language Understanding (NLU) Agent:** Uses a library like Compromise or spaCy.js to process user queries and extract key entities and intents.\n    * **Information Retrieval Agent:** Queries the data mesh based on extracted entities and intents.\n    * **Response Generation Agent:** Uses an LLM to generate natural language responses based on retrieved information.\n* **Implementation (Conceptual):**\n```javascript\n// NLU Agent using Compromise\nconst doc = nlp(userQuery);\nconst entities = doc.entities();\n\n// Response Generation Agent using an LLM (via API)\nconst response = await generateLLMResponse(retrievedInfo);\ndisplayChatbotMessage(response);\n\n```\n\n\n\nThese are a few examples, and the possibilities are extensive. By leveraging the decentralized data architecture, knowledge graphs, and multi-agent workflows, JavaScript developers can build sophisticated LLM-powered web apps that transform how we interact with and utilize complex data in the construction and infrastructure industries.  Remember to consult documentation for specific libraries and LLMs for up-to-date instructions and best practices.  Consider using platforms like LangChain to assist with the development of agents.",

It leverages a series of agents that work together to process a user query by retrieving and analyzing relevant data from a knowledge graph and a data mesh.  The code emphasizes modularity, enabling easy expansion with more specialized agents. The `cosineSimilarity` function provides a basic implementation for calculating cosine similarity between vectors, and placeholder classes are provided for the various components to be fleshed out based on the specific requirements of the system.  Crucially, it integrates uncertainty assessment and filtering to enhance the reliability of the responses. This architecture is designed to be scalable and robust, facilitating real-world applications in complex domains.",
