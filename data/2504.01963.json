  "title": "LLMs Working in Harmony: A Survey on the Technological Aspects of Building Effective LLM-Based Multi Agent Systems",
  "abstract": "Abstract-This survey investigates foundational technologies essential for developing effective Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems. Aiming to answer how best to optimize these systems for collaborative, dynamic environments, we focus on four critical areas: Architecture, Memory, Planning, and Technologies/Frameworks. By analyzing recent advancements and their limitations-such as scalability, real-time response challenges, and agent coordination constraints-we provide a detailed view of the technological landscape. Frameworks like the Mixture of Agents architecture and the ReAct planning model exemplify current innovations, showcasing improvements in role assignment and decision-making. This review synthesizes key strengths and persistent challenges, offering practical recommendations to enhance system scalability, agent collaboration, and adaptability. Our findings provide a roadmap for future research, supporting the creation of robust, efficient multi-agent systems that advance both individual agent performance and collective system resilience.",
  "summary": "This paper surveys technologies for building effective multi-agent systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). It examines how multiple LLMs can work together, focusing on system architecture (how agents are organized), memory (how they retain information), planning (how they decide what to do), and the supporting technologies/frameworks.  Key points for LLM-based multi-agent systems include: various architectures like Mixture of Agents (MoA) for improved collaboration, different memory mechanisms like Vector Databases and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for knowledge access, planning strategies like ReAct for combining reasoning and action, and frameworks such as AutoGen and LangGraph for building and deploying these complex systems. The paper highlights both current capabilities and ongoing challenges in the field.",
  "takeaways": "This paper offers several valuable insights for JavaScript developers venturing into LLM-based multi-agent applications, particularly in web development. Here are some practical examples leveraging popular JavaScript frameworks and tools:\n\n**1. Agent Architecture (MoA in JavaScript):**\n\nThe Mixture of Agents (MoA) architecture can be implemented using JavaScript by structuring your agents as JavaScript classes or objects, with distinct \"proposer\" and \"aggregator\" methods.\n\n```javascript\n// Proposer Agent (e.g., using Langchain.js for LLM interaction)\nclass ProposerAgent {\n  constructor(llm) {\n    this.llm = llm;\n  }\n\n  propose(task) {\n    // Use this.llm to generate diverse responses for the task\n    return this.llm.call(task); \n  }\n}\n\n// Aggregator Agent\nclass AggregatorAgent {\n  aggregate(proposals) {\n    // Implement logic to synthesize proposals (e.g., voting, averaging)\n    // ... (logic to combine results, handle conflicts, etc.)\n    return aggregatedResult;\n  }\n}\n\n\n// Example Usage:\nconst proposer1 = new ProposerAgent(new Langchain.OpenAI());  // Example LLM\nconst proposer2 = new ProposerAgent(new Langchain.HuggingFace()); // Another LLM\nconst aggregator = new AggregatorAgent();\n\nconst task = \"Write a short story about a cat.\";\nconst proposal1 = proposer1.propose(task);\nconst proposal2 = proposer2.propose(task);\n\nconst finalStory = aggregator.aggregate([proposal1, proposal2]);\nconsole.log(finalStory);\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates how different proposer agents (potentially using different LLMs or prompting strategies) can collaborate, and an aggregator synthesizes their output.  You can use libraries like Langchain.js to simplify LLM interactions within your agent classes.\n\n**2. Planning (ReAct in a Web App):**\n\nReAct's principles can be implemented in a web app to enhance user interactions. Imagine a chatbot that helps users plan a trip:\n\n```javascript\n// Simplified ReAct logic in a chatbot component (e.g., React)\n\nconst Chatbot = () => {\n  const [plan, setPlan] = useState([]);\n\n  const handleUserMessage = async (message) => {\n      // 1. Reasoning:  Use an LLM to interpret the user's request and reason about the next action.\n      const reasoningResult = await llm.call(`User: ${message} \\nReasoning and Next Action:`);\n\n      // 2. Action: Extract the action (e.g., \"search for flights\") and parameters from the reasoning.\n      const action = extractAction(reasoningResult);\n      const parameters = extractParameters(reasoningResult);\n\n      // 3. Perform the action (e.g., API call to a flight search service).\n      const actionResult = await performAction(action, parameters);\n\n\n      // 4. Update the plan based on the action result.\n      setPlan([...plan, {reasoning: reasoningResult, action: actionResult }]);\n\n      // ... (render chatbot interface)\n  };\n\n  // ... (rest of the React component)\n\n};\n```\n\nThis simplified example demonstrates the iterative reasoning and action process. You can use browser-based LLMs or connect to server-side LLM APIs.\n\n**3. Memory (Vector Databases with a Frontend):**\n\nIntegrating a vector database like Pinecone or Weaviate with a frontend can power a knowledge-intensive web application.  \n\n```javascript\n// Example: Fetching contextually relevant information for a user query\n\nconst handleSearch = async (query) => {\n  // 1. Embed the user query using a text embedding model.\n  const queryEmbedding = await embeddingModel.embed(query);\n\n\n  // 2. Query the vector database (e.g., Pinecone) for similar vectors/documents.\n  const similarDocuments = await pineconeIndex.query({\n    vector: queryEmbedding,\n    topK: 5, // Number of similar documents to retrieve\n  });\n\n  // 3. Use the retrieved documents as context for an LLM response.\n  const llmResponse = await llm.call(`${query}\\nContext:\\n${similarDocuments.join('\\n')}`);\n\n\n  // ... (display the LLM response on the frontend)\n};\n\n```\n\n**4. AutoGen for Multi-Agent Web Apps:**\n\nWhile AutoGen doesn't have a direct JavaScript implementation yet, its principles can inspire multi-agent web app development.  You could create conversational agents using JavaScript classes, each specialized in a particular domain or task.  These agents could communicate via message passing (e.g., using a message queue or a shared state management library like Redux) and collaborate to fulfill user requests.\n\n**Key Libraries and Technologies:**\n\n* **Langchain.js:** For simplified LLM interactions and chain creation.\n* **Pinecone/Weaviate:** Vector databases for efficient similarity search.\n* **React/Vue/Svelte:** JavaScript frameworks for building interactive web UIs.\n* **Serverless Functions:**  For deploying LLM logic and integrating with APIs.\n\nBy adapting these concepts and leveraging the available JavaScript tools, developers can build practical and engaging multi-agent applications that push the boundaries of web development. Remember that these are simplified illustrations; robust real-world applications require further design considerations for handling error management, security, and scalability.",
