  "title": "FG-PE: Factor-graph Approach for Multi-robot Pursuit-Evasion",
  "abstract": "Abstract-With the increasing use of robots in daily life, there is a growing need to provide robust collaboration protocols for robots to tackle more complicated and dynamic problems effectively. This paper presents a novel, factor graph-based approach to address the pursuit-evasion problem, enabling accurate estimation, planning, and tracking of an evader by multiple pursuers working together. It is assumed that there are multiple pursuers and only one evader in this scenario. The proposed method significantly improves the accuracy of evader estimation and tracking, allowing pursuers to capture the evader in the shortest possible time and distance compared to existing techniques. In addition to these primary objectives, the proposed approach effectively minimizes uncertainty while remaining robust, even when communication issues lead to some messages being dropped or lost. Through a series of comprehensive experiments, this paper demonstrates that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms traditional pursuit-evasion methods across several key performance metrics, such as the time required to capture the evader and the average distance traveled by the pursuers. Additionally, the proposed method is tested in real-world hardware experiments, further validating its effectiveness and applicability.\nIndex Terms-multi-robot system, factor graph, pursuit evasion, uncertainty, tracking",
  "summary": "This paper proposes FG-PE, a novel factor graph approach for solving the multi-robot pursuit-evasion problem.  It uses factor graphs to represent relationships between pursuers, evaders, and the environment, enabling efficient probabilistic reasoning for estimating evader position and planning pursuer movements under uncertainty.\n\nRelevant to LLM-based multi-agent systems are the concepts of: using factor graphs for relationship representation and reasoning in multi-agent scenarios; handling uncertainty in predictions and measurements, crucial for real-world applications where LLMs provide probabilistic outputs; and the demonstrated effectiveness of this approach in minimizing uncertainty and optimizing multi-agent collaboration for a shared goal.  The focus on message passing within the graph structure also suggests potential for integrating LLMs as communication interfaces between agents.",
  "takeaways": "This paper, focusing on pursuit-evasion with factor graphs, offers several interesting concepts applicable to LLM-based multi-agent web applications.  Let's translate these insights into practical JavaScript examples:\n\n**1. Representing Agent Relationships with Factor Graphs:**\n\nThe core idea is using factor graphs to represent relationships between agents (and the environment). In a web app, this could model interactions between LLM-powered bots, user avatars, or even UI elements.  A JavaScript library like `Cytoscape.js` or `vis.js` can visualize and manipulate these graphs.\n\n```javascript\n// Example using Cytoscape.js (simplified)\nconst cy = cytoscape({\n  container: document.getElementById('cy'), // HTML container for graph\n  elements: [\n    { data: { id: 'bot1', type: 'bot', text: 'Bot 1' } }, // LLM bot\n    { data: { id: 'bot2', type: 'bot', text: 'Bot 2' } }, // Another bot\n    { data: { id: 'user1', type: 'user', text: 'User 1' } }, // User avatar\n    { data: { source: 'bot1', target: 'user1', type: 'interaction' } }, // Bot interacting with user\n    { data: { source: 'bot2', target: 'user1', type: 'interaction' } }, // Another bot interacting with user\n  ],\n  style: [ // Visual styling\n     // ... styles for bots, users, and interaction edges\n  ]\n});\n\n\n// Handle user actions (e.g., adding or removing connections in UI) and update factor graph.\n// This update will trigger changes to the agent behaviors.\n```\n\n**2.  LLM-based Prediction and Uncertainty:**\n\nLLMs provide probabilistic outputs. Integrate this with the factor graph by representing the uncertainty of LLM predictions (e.g., the probability of a bot taking a certain action) as edge weights.  Libraries like `simple-statistics` can help calculate and manage uncertainty.\n\n```javascript\n// Get LLM prediction and associated confidence score.\nconst { prediction, confidence } = await getLLMPrediction('bot1', 'actionA');\n\n// Update edge weight based on confidence.  Lower confidence = higher weight (cost).\ncy.edges('[source = \"bot1\"][target = \"actionA\"]').data('weight', 1 - confidence);\n```\n\n**3.  Dynamically Updating the Graph (Real-time Interactions):**\n\nWeb apps are dynamic. As users interact, or bots make decisions, update the factor graph in real-time. This lets you model changing relationships and recalculate optimal paths or actions.\n\n```javascript\n// Example: User sends a message.\ncy.add({ data: { source: 'user1', target: 'bot1', type: 'message', text: 'Hello!' } });\n\n// Trigger recalculation of optimal actions for bots.\nrecalculateBotActions();\n```\n\n**4.  Path Planning and Goal-Oriented Behavior:**\n\nUse the factor graph to guide bot behavior.  Define goals (e.g., completing a user request) as nodes.  The graph optimization algorithms (like the Levenberg-Marquardt mentioned in the paper) can help find the optimal path of actions for a bot to reach its goal, considering uncertainty and interaction costs. Implement a simplified version of LM or use existing optimization libraries like `ml-levenberg-marquardt` to accomplish this.\n\n**5.  Message Passing and Communication:**\n\nModel communication between agents as messages passed along the edges of the factor graph. This could be implemented using WebSockets or server-sent events for real-time communication.\n\n**Example Scenario: Collaborative Content Creation:**\n\nImagine multiple LLM-powered bots collaboratively writing a story in a web app. The factor graph could represent:\n\n* **Nodes:** Bots, story sections, user feedback.\n* **Edges:** Bot contributions to sections, dependencies between sections, user feedback on sections.\n* **Uncertainty:** Confidence in LLM-generated text.\n* **Goals:** Completing the story with specific characteristics (e.g., genre, length).\n\nThe system dynamically updates the graph as bots write and users provide feedback, recalculating optimal contributions to minimize uncertainty and achieve the story goals.\n\n**Key JavaScript Libraries/Frameworks:**\n\n* **`Cytoscape.js`, `vis.js`:** Graph visualization and manipulation.\n* **LLM APIs:**  OpenAI, Cohere, etc. for LLM predictions.\n* **`simple-statistics`, `ml-levenberg-marquardt`:**  For statistical calculations and optimization.\n* **`Socket.IO`, `EventSource`:**  For real-time communication.\n* **React, Vue, Angular:**  For building the web app UI.\n\n\nBy combining the concepts of factor graphs, LLM uncertainty, and dynamic graph updates, you can create complex, interactive, and adaptive multi-agent web applications with JavaScript. This paper provides a strong theoretical foundation for such systems. Remember to start with simplified implementations and gradually incorporate the more advanced features like uncertainty minimization and distributed message passing.",
