  "title": "Incentivizing Multi-Tenant Split Federated Learning for Foundation Models at the Network Edge",
  "abstract": "Abstract-Foundation models (FMs) such as GPT-4 exhibit exceptional generative capabilities across diverse downstream tasks through fine-tuning. Split Federated Learning (SFL) facilitates privacy-preserving FM fine-tuning on resource-constrained local devices by offloading partial FM computations to edge servers, enabling device-edge synergistic fine-tuning. Practical edge networks often host multiple SFL tenants to support diversified downstream tasks. However, existing research primarily focuses on single-tenant SFL scenarios, and lacks tailored incentive mechanisms for multi-tenant settings, which are essential to effectively coordinate self-interested local devices for participation in various downstream tasks, ensuring that each SFL tenant's distinct FM fine-tuning requirements (e.g., FM types, performance targets, and fine-tuning deadlines) are met. To address this gap, we propose a novel Price-Incentive Mechanism (PRINCE) that guides multiple SFL tenants to offer strategic price incentives, which solicit high-quality device participation for efficient FM fine-tuning. Specifically, we first develop a bias-resilient global SFL model aggregation scheme to eliminate model biases caused by independent device participation. We then derive a rigorous SFL convergence bound to evaluate the contributions of heterogeneous devices to FM performance improvements, guiding the incentive strategies of SFL tenants. Furthermore, we model inter-tenant device competition as a congestion game for Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) analysis, deriving each SFL tenant's optimal incentive strategy. Extensive simulations involving four representative SFL tenant types (ViT, BERT, Whisper, and LLaMA) across diverse data modalities (text, images, and audio) demonstrate that PRINCE accelerates FM fine-tuning by up to 3.07x compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while consistently meeting fine-tuning performance targets.",
  "summary": "This paper proposes PRINCE, a new incentive mechanism for training large language models (LLMs) using split federated learning (SFL) in a multi-tenant environment at the network edge.  It addresses the challenge of motivating self-interested devices with varying resources and data quality to contribute to different LLM training tasks simultaneously.  \n\nKey points for LLM-based multi-agent systems:\n\n* **Bias-Resilient SFL:** Addresses potential model biases introduced by independent device participation, crucial in multi-agent scenarios where agents (devices) might have uneven participation.\n* **SFL Convergence Bound:**  Predicts heterogeneous device contributions to LLM performance without completing training, enabling effective incentive allocation across agents.\n* **Congestion Game Modeling:**  Models competition between different LLM training tasks (tenants) for device resources, a core aspect of multi-agent resource allocation.\n* **Decentralized Algorithm:**  Provides a practical implementation for distributing LLM training across multiple agents and tasks, coordinating their actions towards a global goal (optimal LLM performance).",
  "takeaways": "This paper's insights on incentivizing multi-tenant Split Federated Learning (SFL) for Foundation Models (FMs) can be applied by JavaScript developers to build innovative LLM-based multi-agent web applications. Here are some practical examples:\n\n**1. Collaborative Content Creation with Multiple LLMs:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine a collaborative writing platform where multiple users leverage different specialized LLMs (e.g., one for grammar, another for style, a third for fact-checking) to co-author a document.\n* **Application of PRINCE:**  A JavaScript developer could implement the PRINCE mechanism to manage the interaction between these LLMs (as SFL tenants) and users (as local devices). Each LLM would offer \"price\" incentives (e.g., higher priority or faster processing) to users who provide high-quality input or feedback.  The PRINCE algorithm would balance the contributions of each LLM, ensuring a consistent and high-quality final output.\n* **Implementation:** Node.js could handle backend logic, managing LLM interactions and implementing the PRINCE algorithm. Frontend frameworks like React or Vue.js could manage user interfaces and data visualization of LLM contributions. Libraries like TensorFlow.js could be explored for client-side model updates (if applicable).\n\n**2. Personalized Recommendations with Multiple LLMs:**\n\n* **Scenario:** An e-commerce website uses multiple LLMs specializing in different product categories (e.g., fashion, electronics, books) to generate personalized recommendations for users.\n* **Application of PRINCE:** PRINCE could incentivize LLMs to compete for user attention by offering more relevant or diverse recommendations. Users would implicitly express their preferences by interacting with recommendations, providing feedback to the system and influencing LLM incentives. The bias-resilient SFL aggregation would ensure that recommendations remain diverse even if some LLMs are more popular than others.\n* **Implementation:**  Similar to the previous example, Node.js could manage the backend, and a frontend framework like React could build interactive recommendation interfaces.  User activity tracking would provide data for calculating LLM incentives.\n\n**3. Multi-Agent Game Development with LLMs:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Develop a browser-based multi-agent game where each agent is powered by an LLM and interacts with a shared environment. Each LLM could represent a different character class or strategy.\n* **Application of PRINCE:** PRINCE could be used to manage resource allocation within the game, ensuring that each LLM/agent has a fair chance to access resources and influence the game's outcome. The pricing strategy could be linked to in-game resources or objectives, motivating LLMs to compete effectively.\n* **Implementation:** Libraries like Phaser or Babylon.js could create the game environment. WebSockets could handle real-time communication between the game server (managing PRINCE) and client browsers (running LLM interfaces).\n\n**4. Decentralized Knowledge Base Management with LLMs:**\n\n* **Scenario:** A community-driven knowledge base is managed by multiple LLMs, each specializing in a different domain. Users contribute information and validate entries.\n* **Application of PRINCE:** PRINCE could incentivize LLMs to validate and update entries in their areas of expertise, ensuring consistent and accurate knowledge across domains. User contributions would be weighted based on their perceived accuracy and relevance, impacting LLM incentives.\n* **Implementation:** A distributed database like MongoDB could store the knowledge base. Each LLM could be implemented as a separate microservice using Node.js. A frontend platform built with React could facilitate user contributions and knowledge exploration.\n\n\n**Key JavaScript Considerations:**\n\n* **Asynchronous Communication:**  Multi-agent systems rely heavily on asynchronous communication. JavaScript's event loop and asynchronous programming paradigms (Promises, async/await) are well-suited for this.\n* **Modular Design:**  Break down complex systems into smaller, reusable modules or components. This is particularly important for managing multiple LLMs and their interactions. Frameworks like React promote this design philosophy.\n* **Data Visualization:** Clearly visualizing LLM contributions, incentives, and overall system behavior is essential for understanding and debugging. JavaScript libraries like D3.js or Chart.js are helpful.\n* **Scalability:** Consider the scalability implications of running multiple LLMs and managing complex interactions. Distributed systems and efficient data structures are important for larger-scale applications.\n\n\nBy understanding the core principles of PRINCE and adapting the JavaScript implementation to their specific use case, developers can effectively leverage this research to create innovative and intelligent LLM-based multi-agent web applications.  Remember that these are just starting points. The flexibility and adaptability of JavaScript and its ecosystem allow for a wide range of creative applications of these concepts.",

Its core purpose is to train a Foundation Model (FM) across multiple devices in a privacy-preserving and efficient manner, handling independent device participation. The algorithm operates in synchronization cycles. Within each cycle, devices perform local training on their respective data partitions (device-side submodels) and the server aggregates these updates along with its server-side computations to create a new global model.  The key improvement for bias resilience is the re-weighting of device updates during aggregation, inversely proportional to their participation levels.\n\n\n**Algorithm 2 Explanation:**\n\nThis algorithm, PRINCE (Price-Incentive mechanism), coordinates the interaction between multiple SFL tenants and devices to optimize the overall FM training performance in a multi-tenant environment.  It's based on a two-phase Stackelberg game: In Phase II, devices choose their participation levels in different tenants' tasks to maximize their own utility (payment minus training cost).  In Phase I, tenants adjust their pricing strategies to minimize their expected global FM loss, taking into account the devices' reactions. This iterative process continues until no further improvements can be made, reaching a Stackelberg Equilibrium. This decentralized approach allows tenants and devices to act independently based on their interests.  The algorithm also uses the SFL convergence bound (Theorem 2) to estimate the expected loss, avoiding the need for full training runs during price optimization.",
