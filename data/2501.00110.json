  "title": "MODELLING AND CONTROL OF SPATIAL BEHAVIOURS IN MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS TO BIOLOGY AND ROBOTICS",
  "abstract": "Large-Scale Multi-Agent Systems (LS-MAS) consist of several autonomous components, interacting in a non-trivial way, so that the emerging behaviour of the ensemble depends on the individual dynamics of the components and their reciprocal interactions. These models can describe a rich variety of natural systems, as well as artificial ones, characterised by unparalleled scalability, robustness, and flexibility. Indeed, a crucial objective is devising efficient strategies to model and control the spatial behaviours of LS-MAS to achieve specific goals. However, the inherent complexity of these systems and the wide spectrum of their emerging behaviours pose significant challenges. The overarching goal of this thesis is, therefore, to advance methods for modelling, analyzing and controlling the spatial behaviours of LS-MAS, with applications to cellular populations and swarm robotics. The thesis begins with an overview of the existing Literature, and is then organized into two distinct parts. In the context of swarm robotics, Part I deals with distributed control algorithms to spatially organize agents on geometric patterns. The contribution is twofold, encompassing both the development of original control algorithms, and providing a novel formal analysis, which allows to guarantee the emergence of specific geometric patterns. In Part II, looking at the spatial behaviours of biological agents, experiments are carried out to study the movement of microorganisms and their response to light stimuli. This allows the derivation and parametrization of mathematical models that capture these behaviours, and pave the way for the development of innovative approaches for the spatial control of microorganisms. The results presented in the thesis were developed by leveraging formal analytical tools, simulations, and experiments, using innovative platforms and original computational frameworks.",
  "summary": "This PhD thesis investigates the modeling and control of spatial behaviors in multi-agent systems, with applications in swarm robotics and the control of microorganisms.  The author develops a distributed control algorithm for robots to form geometric patterns (like lattices) and uses a data-driven approach to model the motion and light response of microorganisms, aiming for spatial control.\n\n\nKey points for LLM-based multi-agent systems:\n\n* **Formal methods:** The thesis uses formal analysis (graph theory, Lyapunov stability) to prove the stability of robot formations, which could inspire similar rigorous approaches to verify the emergent behavior of LLM-based agents.\n* **Data-driven modeling:**  The data-driven approach used to model microorganism behavior offers a potential pathway for modeling complex interactions and emergent behaviors in LLM-agent systems where first-principles models are difficult to construct.\n* **Spatiotemporal control:** The concept of controlling agent density and behavior in both space and time, explored with microorganisms, could translate to managing and coordinating large numbers of LLM agents in virtual or physical environments.\n* **Hierarchical control:** The thesis proposes a hierarchical control architecture (high-level task specification to individual agent control) which could be valuable for structuring complex LLM-based multi-agent applications.\n* **SwarmSim:** The author develops SwarmSim, a multi-agent simulation framework that could be extended to incorporate LLM-based agent behaviors and explore emergent properties in simulated environments.",
  "takeaways": "This PhD thesis explores modelling, analysis, and control of spatial behaviors in multi-agent systems (MAS), with applications to swarm robotics and biological agents. While written for robotics and biology researchers, many of the concepts translate directly to LLM-based multi-agent applications in web development, particularly those employing spatial or geometric metaphors.  Let's examine how a JavaScript developer could apply the thesis' insights:\n\n**1. Spatial Organization and Pattern Formation with LLMs:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine a collaborative writing application where multiple LLM agents contribute to a document. The thesis's exploration of pattern formation (e.g., triangular lattices) could be applied to visually represent these agents' contributions in a structured, spatial manner on the screen, rather than just a linear text flow.  Think of a mind-map where LLMs expand different branches based on expertise and consensus protocols.\n* **Implementation:** A JavaScript developer could use a canvas library like Fabric.js or Konva to represent agents and their interactions visually. The thesis's control algorithms (Chapter 4), though requiring adaptation, offer a starting point for defining how LLMs dynamically position their contributions to achieve a desired visual structure.\n* **LLM Integration:** LLMs can generate the content displayed at each node of the \"lattice\".  Consensus protocols (mentioned in thesis section 2.1) could be implemented to decide which LLM's output is accepted at a given position, based on factors like confidence scores or user feedback.\n\n**2. Modeling LLM Interactions and Dynamics:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Consider an online debate platform where multiple LLMs represent different viewpoints.  The thesis's microscopic modeling approach (Section 2.2) can be used to represent each LLM individually and define how they interact (e.g., through argumentation, refutation).\n* **Implementation:**  Node.js with a graph database like Neo4j can be used to model LLMs and their interaction network.  The thesis's use of graph theory (Section 3.2.2 and 5.1) provides valuable inspiration. Each LLMâ€™s internal state can be tracked, and the evolution of the debate can be simulated using techniques inspired by the thesis.\n* **LLM Enhancement:** The stochastic nature of LLM behavior (addressed in Chapter 8) can be incorporated by adding noise or probabilistic elements to the model, reflecting the inherent uncertainty in LLM-generated responses.\n\n**3. Data-Driven Modeling of LLMs (Chapter 8):**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine a multi-agent customer service application where LLMs handle various inquiries. The thesis's data-driven modeling approach can be used to learn and model the behavior of LLMs in responding to customer requests, including their reaction to different types of input (e.g., positive vs. negative feedback).\n* **Implementation:** Collect data on LLM interactions (user queries, LLM responses, user satisfaction). Use this data to train a model (e.g., a recurrent neural network with TensorFlow.js) that captures the stochastic dynamics of each LLM, similar to the thesis's stochastic differential equations approach.\n* **Web Application Benefits:** The trained model can then be used to predict the likely response of an LLM to a new input and optimize the selection of the most appropriate LLM for a given query in the web application.\n\n**4. Spatial Control of LLMs in Virtual Environments:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  Develop a multi-agent educational game where LLMs act as virtual tutors, guiding students through a virtual space. The thesis's spatiotemporal control concepts (Chapter 6) can be used to control the positions and actions of these LLM agents within the virtual environment, based on student progress and learning goals.\n* **Implementation:** Use a JavaScript 3D library like Three.js or Babylon.js to create the virtual environment. Adapt the thesis's control algorithms to direct the movement and actions (content generation, feedback) of the LLM agents in this space.\n* **LLM Capabilities:** LLMs can generate dynamic narratives, provide personalized explanations, and offer interactive challenges within the game based on their spatial location and student interaction.\n\n**JavaScript Libraries and Frameworks:**\n\n* **Visualization:**  D3.js, Chart.js, Fabric.js, Konva, Three.js, Babylon.js\n* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js\n* **Databases:** MongoDB, Neo4j\n* **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow.js, Brain.js\n\nBy adapting the thesis's concepts and using appropriate JavaScript tools, developers can unlock the potential of LLM-based MAS, creating intelligent and interactive web applications with spatially organized agents, emergent behavior, and robust performance.",

Its purpose is to identify outliers within a dataset (provided as a 1D or multidimensional array) based on a given threshold.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1. **Input:** The function takes two arguments:\n   - `d`: The dataset (a vector or a multidimensional array).\n   - `m`: A positive threshold value.  This should be thought of as a number of Median Average Deviations (MAD).\n\n2. **Threshold Check:** Ensures that the threshold `m` is a positive number.\n\n3. **Initialization:**  If `d` is multidimensional the array is flattened using `flat()`. An empty list called `outliers` is created to store the indices of identified outliers.\n\n4. **Median Calculation:** The `median` function (also provided in the JS code) computes the median of the dataset.\n\n5. **Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) Calculation:** The MAD is calculated, a robust measure of data variability.\n\n6. **Outlier Detection:** The code iterates through each element of the dataset. For each element:\n   - It calculates a normalized variation `s`: the absolute difference between the element and the median, divided by the MAD. This normalized variation `s` represents the number of MADs a given point is from the median.\n   - If `s` is greater than or equal to the threshold `m`, the index of the element is added to the `outliers` list.\n\n7. **Output:** The function returns the `outliers` list containing the indices (or adjusted indicies if multidimensional) of the detected outliers.\n\n\nThis outlier detection method, based on the median and MAD, is more robust to the presence of outliers in the data compared to methods that use the mean and standard deviation. The median and MAD are less affected by extreme values.",
