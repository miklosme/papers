  "title": "The B2Scala Tool: Integrating Bach in Scala with Security in Mind",
  "abstract": "Process algebras have been widely used to verify security protocols in a formal manner. However, they mostly focus on synchronous communication based on the exchange of messages.  We present an alternative approach relying on asynchronous communication obtained through information available on a shared space. More precisely, this paper first proposes an embedding in Scala of a Linda-like language, called Bach. It consists of a Domain Specific Language, internal to Scala, that allows us to experiment programs developed in Bach while benefiting from the Scala eco-system, in particular from its type system as well as program fragments developed in Scala. Moreover, we introduce a logic that allows us to restrict the executions of programs to those meeting logic formulae. Our work is illustrated on the Needham-Schroeder security protocol, for which we manage to automatically rediscover the man-in-the-middle attack first put in evidence by G. Lowe.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces B2Scala, a tool embedding the Bach coordination language within Scala, for analyzing security protocols.  Bach uses asynchronous communication via a shared data space (similar to Linda), which naturally models network interactions.  B2Scala leverages Scala's ecosystem (type system, concise syntax) and Bach's process algebra abstractions for modeling concurrent agent behavior. A logic language called bsL allows constraining execution paths for analysis. The Needham-Schroeder protocol is used as a case study, demonstrating how B2Scala automatically reproduces a known security attack.\n\nThe key point relevant to LLM-based multi-agent systems is the asynchronous communication model using a shared data space (the \"store\").  This mirrors how LLMs in a multi-agent setting might interact: by posting and retrieving messages/information from a central location rather than directly exchanging messages.  B2Scala's bsL logic provides a mechanism analogous to how one might want to control and analyze multi-agent LLM interactions by specifying allowed and disallowed communication patterns. This approach is particularly relevant for controlling LLM agents and verifying they meet specified interaction criteria.",
  "takeaways": "This paper introduces B2Scala, a tool embedding the Bach coordination language within Scala for analyzing security protocols, particularly focusing on asynchronous communication. While the paper itself uses Scala, its core concepts translate well to JavaScript for LLM-based multi-agent web applications. Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights:\n\n**1. Asynchronous Communication and Shared Spaces:**\n\n* **Concept:** B2Scala leverages Bach's asynchronous communication via a shared space (the \"store\"). This mirrors how web agents might interact through a central database, message queue (e.g., Redis, RabbitMQ), or a shared state management system (e.g., Redux, MobX).\n* **JavaScript Application:**  Imagine building a collaborative text editor with multiple LLM agents. Each agent could represent a user or a specialized editing bot (grammar, style, etc.).  Instead of direct communication, they interact by posting changes to a shared JSON document representing the editor's state. Libraries like Socket.IO can facilitate real-time updates.\n\n```javascript\n// Simplified example using Socket.IO and a shared JSON document (store)\nsocket.on('documentUpdate', (update) => {\n    // Apply update to the shared document\n    applyUpdate(sharedDocument, update);\n\n    // LLM agent processes the updated document\n    llmAgent.process(sharedDocument).then(response => {\n        // Post LLM's action back to the store\n        socket.emit('documentUpdate', { action: response });\n    });\n});\n```\n\n**2. Agent Behavior and Coordination:**\n\n* **Concept:** B2Scala defines agent behavior using process calculus-inspired constructs (sequential composition, parallel composition, choice).  These translate to async/await, Promises, and conditional logic in JavaScript.\n* **JavaScript Application:**  In the collaborative editor, an LLM agent's behavior can be defined as a sequence of actions: `get latest document state -> analyze -> suggest edits -> post edits`.  Different agents can operate concurrently using `async/await` or Promises.  Choice can be implemented using `if/else` based on the document's state or LLM's analysis.\n\n```javascript\nasync function agentBehavior() {\n    const document = await getDocumentState();\n    const analysis = await llmAgent.analyze(document);\n\n    if (analysis.needsGrammarFix) {\n      const grammarEdits = await llmAgent.suggestGrammarFixes(document);\n      await postEdits(grammarEdits);\n    } else if (analysis.needsStyleImprovement) { \n      // ... other agent behaviors ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**3. Constrained Executions and Logic Formulae:**\n\n* **Concept:** B2Scala uses logic formulae to constrain agent executions, enabling selective exploration of behaviors. This can be implemented in JavaScript using assertion libraries or custom logic functions.\n* **JavaScript Application:** In the editor, you might want to constrain agents to only suggest edits if the document's sentiment is positive.  Before posting edits, the agent checks the document's sentiment (perhaps analyzed by another LLM agent) and proceeds only if the condition is met.\n\n```javascript\nasync function constrainedAgentBehavior() {\n    // ... (previous agent logic)\n\n    if (document.sentiment === 'positive') {\n        await postEdits(edits);\n    } else {\n        console.log(\"Edits not posted due to negative sentiment.\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**4. B2Scala's GSum and Dynamic Agent Selection:**\n\n* **Concept:** B2Scala's `GSum` allows choosing agent behavior based on dynamic data. This translates well to JavaScript's dynamic function calls and data-driven logic.\n* **JavaScript Application:**  Imagine an e-commerce site with LLM-powered shopping assistants. The agent's behavior could be selected dynamically based on the user's browsing history. If the user frequently browses electronics, select an agent specializing in electronics recommendations.\n\n```javascript\nconst agentTypes = {\n    electronics: electronicsAgent,\n    fashion: fashionAgent,\n    // ... other agent types\n};\n\nfunction getAgent(userHistory) {\n    if (userHistory.mostFrequentCategory === 'electronics') {\n        return agentTypes.electronics;\n    } else if (userHistory.mostFrequentCategory === 'fashion') {\n        return agentTypes.fashion;\n    } // ...\n}\n\nconst agent = getAgent(userHistory);\nagent.startShoppingAssistance(); // Dynamically chosen agent starts\n```\n\n\n**Frameworks/Libraries:**\n\n* **Langchain:** Offers a structured way to chain together different LLM calls, manage prompts, and integrate with external data sources, aligning with B2Scala's concepts of sequential agent behavior.\n* **AutoGPT:** Automates prompting and task management for LLMs, particularly useful for defining complex agent behaviors and sequences.\n* **Socket.IO:**  Facilitates real-time communication between agents, simulating B2Scala's shared space in a web context.\n\n\nBy adapting these examples and leveraging relevant JavaScript technologies, developers can build powerful LLM-based multi-agent web applications inspired by the core principles of B2Scala and Bach. The focus on asynchronous communication, coordinated behaviors, and constrained executions will enhance flexibility, robustness, and control over complex multi-agent interactions in the browser and beyond.",
  "pseudocode": "No pseudocode block found. However, the paper presents code examples in Bach and Scala, illustrating the implementation of the Needham-Schroeder protocol and the logic for constrained executions.  These examples can be adapted into JavaScript for experimentation and demonstration.  Specifically:\n\n* **Bach Code:** The Bach code examples demonstrate the agent interactions in the Needham-Schroeder protocol. These can be translated to JavaScript objects representing agents and their actions (tell, get, nask).  A shared data space (store) can be simulated using a JavaScript array or object.\n\n* **Scala Code (B2Scala):** The Scala implementation (B2Scala) provides the structure for embedding Bach within a typed language environment.  This can be emulated in JavaScript by using classes or objects to define agents, messages, and the store.  The Scala code showcasing data declarations (SI_Term, Token), agent definitions (Alice, Bob, Mallory), and constrained executions (bsL-calculus) can be adapted into equivalent JavaScript constructs.\n\n* **Logic (bsL-calculus):** The logic for constrained executions can be implemented in JavaScript using functions that evaluate conditions on the store and guide the execution flow.\n\nWhile a direct copy-paste translation of the Scala code might not be the most idiomatic JavaScript, the core concepts can be effectively demonstrated and experimented with using JavaScript and browser technologies.  This allows JavaScript developers to grasp the practical aspects of multi-agent system development based on LLM's and the implications of this research for web development.",
