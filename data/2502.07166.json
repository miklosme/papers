  "title": "Bayesian Optimization for Building Social-Influence-Free Consensus",
  "abstract": "We introduce Social Bayesian Optimization (SBO), a vote-efficient algorithm for consensus-building in collective decision-making. In contrast to single-agent scenarios, collective decision-making encompasses group dynamics that may distort agents' preference feedback, thereby impeding their capacity to achieve a social-influence-free consensus—the most preferable decision based on the aggregated agent utilities. We demonstrate that under mild rationality assumptions, reaching social-influence-free consensus using noisy feedback alone is impossible. To address this, SBO employs a dual voting system: cheap but noisy public votes (e.g., show of hands in a meeting), and more accurate, though expensive, private votes (e.g., one-to-one interview). We model social influence using an unknown social graph and leverage the dual voting system to efficiently learn this graph. Our theoretical findings show that social graph estimation converges faster than the black-box estimation of agents' utilities, allowing us to reduce reliance on costly private votes early in the process. This enables efficient consensus-building primarily through noisy public votes, which are debiased based on the estimated social graph to infer social-influence-free feedback. We validate the efficacy of SBO across multiple real-world applications, including thermal comfort, team building, travel negotiation, and energy trading collaboration.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces Social Bayesian Optimization (SBO), a method for group decision-making that minimizes the influence of social dynamics (e.g., groupthink) on individual preferences. It uses a dual voting system: \"public\" votes (easily influenced) and \"private\" votes (truthful but expensive).  SBO models social influence as a graph and learns this graph using the dual votes.  This allows the system to rely primarily on the cheaper public votes while correcting for social influence.\n\nFor LLM-based multi-agent systems, SBO offers a framework for achieving truthful consensus by combining cheaper, readily available, but potentially biased interactions (analogous to public votes) with more costly, less readily available unbiased interactions (analogous to private votes). It highlights the importance of accounting for and mitigating social influence in multi-agent systems, particularly when using LLMs for preference elicitation and decision-making.  The proposed graph-based approach to modeling social influence could be relevant for understanding and controlling interactions in LLM-driven multi-agent communication.",
  "takeaways": "This paper introduces Social Bayesian Optimization (SBO) to address the challenges of building consensus in multi-agent systems, particularly relevant for LLM-based agents interacting in web applications.  Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights:\n\n**1. Dual Voting System for Debiasing LLM Preferences:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine building a collaborative writing app with multiple LLM agents assisting users.  Each agent might have a different writing style and suggest different edits.  Directly aggregating their suggestions might lead to a suboptimal or biased outcome influenced by a dominant LLM.\n\n* **Implementation:** Implement a dual voting system where:\n    * **Public Vote (Noisy):** The LLMs provide initial suggestions displayed publicly, allowing other agents and users to see and react. This can be done using a JavaScript framework like React or Vue.js to manage the UI and display the suggestions dynamically.\n    * **Private Vote (Accurate):**  Each LLM also provides a private, independent ranking of the suggestions. This ranking isn't influenced by other agents and represents the LLM's true preference.  This can be handled in the backend using Node.js and a message queue system (like RabbitMQ or Redis) to communicate privately with each LLM.\n\n* **Debiasing:** Analyze the discrepancies between public and private votes to identify and quantify social influence (e.g., one LLM disproportionately swaying others).  Use a graph structure (adjacency matrix) in JavaScript to represent the LLM interaction network and update it as new votes are collected.  Use the learned graph to debias the public votes, effectively inferring the social-influence-free preferences. Libraries like TensorFlow.js or Math.js can be used for matrix operations.\n\n**2. Efficient Preference Elicitation for LLMs:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Developing a multi-agent travel planning application where LLM agents negotiate flight options, hotel bookings, etc., with each other and the user.  Eliciting full preference rankings from each agent for all possible combinations of options is computationally expensive.\n\n* **Implementation:**  Employ an adaptive voting scheme inspired by SBO.  Instead of exhaustive pairwise comparisons, dynamically select the most informative pairs of options to query the LLMs. For instance, if two flight options are very similar, there's little value in querying the LLMs about their preference.  Prioritize queries that maximize information gain, leading to faster convergence to a consensus.\n\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** Use a Bayesian Optimization library (e.g., a custom implementation using TensorFlow.js or adapting existing Python libraries) to manage the acquisition function (like the UCB in the paper) and select the next query dynamically.\n\n**3. Flexible Aggregation of LLM Utilities:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Building a multi-agent e-commerce platform where LLMs act as shopping assistants for different users. The platform needs to aggregate the utilities (preferences) of the LLMs to recommend products to a group of users shopping together.\n\n* **Implementation:** Implement the Generalized Gini Social-Evaluation Welfare Function (GSF) in JavaScript. This allows for flexible aggregation, interpolating between utilitarian (majority preference) and egalitarian (focus on the least satisfied agent) approaches.  The parameter 'p' in the GSF can be tuned based on the application's needs.\n\n* **Example:** If fairness is crucial, set 'p' closer to 0 (egalitarian). If efficiency is prioritized, set 'p' closer to 1 (utilitarian).  This can be implemented as a configuration parameter in your application.\n\n\n**4. Addressing the Impossibility Theorem:**\n\nThe paper's impossibility theorem highlights that achieving a perfect, social-influence-free consensus is impossible without extra information (like the private votes).  This means:\n\n* **Awareness:** Be aware that some level of social influence is inevitable in LLM-based multi-agent systems.\n* **Mitigation:** Implement strategies like the dual voting system and efficient preference elicitation to minimize the impact of social influence.\n* **Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the LLM interactions and analyze the discrepancies between public and private votes to assess the level of social influence.\n\nBy incorporating these strategies, JavaScript developers can build more robust, fair, and efficient LLM-based multi-agent applications for the web.  The dual voting system and adaptive preference elicitation are particularly impactful for mitigating bias and improving the efficiency of consensus building. Using JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue.js, and backend technologies like Node.js combined with mathematical libraries like TensorFlow.js provide a solid foundation for implementing these concepts in real-world web applications.",

Its purpose is to find a consensus option among multiple agents (decision-makers) while accounting for social influence and minimizing the use of costly private votes.  It works as follows:\n\n1. **Initialization:** Sets up data structures to store public and private votes, initializes confidence sets for utility functions and the social graph, and selects an initial option.\n\n2. **Iteration:**  The algorithm iterates for a fixed budget (T). In each iteration:\n    - It chooses the next option (`x_t`) to query based on an optimistic acquisition function (see Eq. 4 in paper). This function balances exploration and exploitation, aiming to find the option with the highest potential to improve the consensus.\n    - It queries public votes, which are susceptible to social influence.\n    - It updates the confidence sets for utility functions and the social graph based on the observed votes.  \n    - It checks a stopping criterion based on the projection weight (Eq. 5). If the criterion is met (indicating sufficient confidence in the social graph estimate), it queries private votes (which are not influenced). Private votes help correct for biases introduced by social influence.\n\n3. **Consensus Estimation:** After the iterations, the algorithm estimates the final consensus based on the refined confidence set for true utilities and the specified aggregation function.\n\nThe key innovation of SBO is the dual voting system.  By using noisy but cheap public votes and incorporating private votes only when necessary, it aims to reach a social-influence-free consensus efficiently. The helper functions in the JavaScript code are placeholders, their implementation details are substantial and should be derived based on the specifics of chosen Bayesian models, kernel functions, optimization methods, and other details provided in the paper's appendix.",
