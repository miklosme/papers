  "title": "Multi-Agent Fact Checking",
  "abstract": "We formulate the problem of fake news detection using distributed fact-checkers (agents) with unknown reliability. The stream of news/statements is modeled as an independent and identically distributed binary source (to represent true and false statements). Upon observing a news, agent *i* labels the news as true or false which reflects the true validity of the statement with some probability 1 − πᵢ. In other words, agent *i* misclassified each statement with error probability πᵢ ∈ (0, 1), where the parameter πᵢ models the (un)trustworthiness of agent *i*. We present an algorithm to learn the unreliability parameters, resulting in a distributed fact-checking algorithm. Furthermore, we extensively analyze the discrete-time limit of our algorithm.",
  "summary": "This paper tackles the problem of automated fact-checking using multiple unreliable AI agents (like LLMs). It proposes a method to estimate each agent's individual error rate (unreliability) over time, without needing to know the true answers in advance.  The core idea involves observing the agents' agreements and disagreements and updating the reliability estimates accordingly.  This is relevant to LLM-based multi-agent systems because it offers a way to improve overall system accuracy by dynamically weighting individual LLM outputs based on their learned trustworthiness.  It shifts the paradigm from relying on pre-defined LLM confidence scores to dynamically learning LLM reliability based on observed performance in a multi-agent setting.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents a robust method for handling unreliability in multi-agent systems, a crucial aspect when dealing with LLMs in a web app context. Here are some practical examples of how JavaScript developers can apply these insights to LLM-based multi-agent projects:\n\n**1. Collaborative Content Creation:** Imagine building a web application for collaborative story writing using multiple LLMs. Each LLM agent could be specialized in a particular genre or writing style, contributing sentences or paragraphs to the story.  However, LLMs can be prone to generating inconsistent or illogical content. Applying the paper’s online estimator, you can track the reliability of each LLM based on user feedback or pre-defined consistency metrics.  This reliability score can be used to weight each agent's contribution. A highly reliable agent’s output would have more influence on the final story, while a less reliable agent's output might be further reviewed or edited.  You can implement this weighting mechanism using a JavaScript framework like React or Vue.js, updating the UI dynamically based on the reliability scores.\n\n```javascript\n// Simplified example using React\nconst [agentReliability, setAgentReliability] = useState({\n  agent1: 0.9,\n  agent2: 0.7,\n  agent3: 0.8\n});\n\n// ... Inside a function handling LLM output\nconst weightedContribution = (agentOutput, agentName) => {\n  return agentOutput * agentReliability[agentName];\n};\n\n// ... Integrating into the story\nlet story = \"\";\nstory += weightedContribution(agent1Output, \"agent1\");\nstory += weightedContribution(agent2Output, \"agent2\");\n// ... and so on\n```\n\n**2. Multi-Agent Customer Support Chatbot:** Consider a customer support system where multiple LLM agents handle different aspects of customer queries, such as order tracking, technical support, or billing. Each agent could be trained on a specific domain, and the system dynamically routes queries to the most relevant agent. Using the paper’s framework, you can estimate the reliability of each agent based on customer satisfaction ratings, resolution times, or other relevant metrics. The system can learn over time to prioritize routing queries to more reliable agents, potentially leading to improved customer satisfaction.  Node.js and a library like Socket.IO could handle the real-time communication and agent coordination.\n\n**3. Decentralized Fact-Checking:** As illustrated in the paper, multi-agent systems can be applied to fact-checking tasks. In a web application setting, you could use multiple LLMs, each specializing in verifying different aspects of a news article or claim, such as source credibility, factual consistency, or logical coherence. By monitoring the individual assessments and applying the distributed fact-checking algorithm, the application can provide a more robust and nuanced assessment of the information's validity, dynamically updating the trust scores presented to the user in the browser.\n\n**4. Personalized Recommendations:** LLMs can be used to create personalized recommendation systems. Consider an e-commerce platform where multiple LLM agents specialize in different product categories.  These agents could generate recommendations for users based on their browsing history, purchase patterns, or explicit preferences. However, user feedback is essential for refining these recommendations.  The paper's reliability estimation framework can be used to assess the performance of each LLM agent based on user acceptance or rejection of recommendations, thereby dynamically adapting the weight given to each agent's output in the recommendation generation process.\n\n**JavaScript Libraries & Frameworks for Implementation:**\n\n* **LangChain:** Simplifies interactions with LLMs and allows for chaining prompts and agent responses.\n* **React/Vue.js:** Enable dynamic updates of reliability scores and weighted outputs in the user interface.\n* **Node.js & Socket.IO:** Facilitate real-time communication and coordination among agents in a distributed setting.\n* **TensorFlow.js:** Can be used for implementing custom reliability metrics and estimators if needed.\n\nBy incorporating the principles from this paper, JavaScript developers can build more robust, adaptive, and trustworthy LLM-based multi-agent web applications.  The ability to assess and adapt to agent unreliability in real-time opens exciting possibilities for creating intelligent and responsive web experiences.",

It includes the following key components:\n\n1. **`factChecker` Function:** This function acts as a factory, initializing the reliability estimates and returning an `updateReliability` function. The factory pattern allows the `stepSizeFunc` and the number of agents to be configured upon initialization.\n\n2. **`updateReliability` Function:**  This function takes the agent outputs (`agentOutputs`) as input. It calculates the likelihood ratio based on the current reliability estimates using `calculateLikelihoodRatio`. It then estimates the source validity (`estimatedSource`).  Finally, it updates the reliability for each agent based on equation (6), incorporating the step size and the comparison between the agent's output and the estimated source validity.  A simplified projection logic is included to prevent reliability estimates from converging to 0 or 1. This projection is illustrative and should be replaced with the more robust truncation method described in the paper for a real-world implementation.\n\n3. **`calculateLikelihoodRatio` Function**: This helper function calculates the likelihood ratio L(t) as defined in equation (4) of the paper.\n\n4. **Example Usage:** This section demonstrates how to initialize and use the `factChecker` with a harmonic step size function. This step size is just an example; the paper discusses other options.  It simulates some agent outputs and shows how to update the reliability.\n\n**Purpose:**\n\nThe algorithm's purpose is to estimate the reliability of multiple agents in a distributed fact-checking system.  It's designed for an online setting, meaning it processes data as it becomes available and updates the reliability estimates incrementally, without requiring the entire dataset to be stored in memory. It addresses the challenge of estimating agent reliability when the true validity of the information is unknown.\n\n**Key Improvements from Previous Responses:**\n\n* **Functional Approach:** Uses a factory pattern for cleaner initialization and state management.\n* **Clarity:** Variable names and structure are closer to the paper's notation.\n* **Step Size:** The step size is passed as a function for greater flexibility and uses a harmonic sequence.\n* **Projection:** Includes a simplified projection to illustrate the concept (should be replaced with truncation in a real-world application as the paper discusses).\n* **Comments:**  Detailed comments explain the code's relation to the research paper.\n* **Correctness:** Addresses and corrects any potential mathematical or logical errors in previous responses.\n\n\nThis improved JavaScript implementation provides a more accurate and usable foundation for developers experimenting with the concepts from the research paper. It also highlights key aspects like the step size function and the need for robust truncation/projection. Remember to replace the simplified projection with the full truncation method described in the paper, especially for a real-world application.",
