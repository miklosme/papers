  "title": "Agent-based Modeling meets the Capability Approach for Human Development: Simulating Homelessness Policy-making",
  "abstract": "The global rise in homelessness calls for urgent and alternative policy solutions. Non-profits and governmental organizations alert about the many challenges faced by people experiencing homelessness (PEH), which include not only the lack of shelter but also the lack of opportunities for personal development. In this context, the capability approach (CA), which underpins the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), provides a comprehensive framework to assess inequity in terms of real opportunities. This paper explores how the CA can be combined with agent-based modelling and reinforcement learning. The goals are: (1) implementing the CA as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), (2) building on such MDP to develop a rich decision-making model that accounts for more complex motivators of behaviour, such as values and needs, and (3) developing an agent-based simulation framework that allows to assess alternative policies aiming to expand or restore people's capabilities. The framework is developed in a real case study of health inequity and homelessness, working in collaboration with stakeholders, non-profits and domain experts. The ultimate goal of the project is to develop a novel agent-based simulation framework, rooted in the CA, which can be replicated in a diversity of social contexts to assess policies in a non-invasive way.",
  "summary": "This paper proposes a novel approach to simulating homelessness policy-making by combining agent-based modeling (ABM) with the Capability Approach (CA) from human development theory.  The CA focuses on assessing policies based on their impact on individuals' real opportunities (capabilities) rather than just resource allocation.\n\nKey points for LLM-based multi-agent systems:\n\n* **CA as MDP:** The CA is framed as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), providing a structured way to model agent decision-making based on capabilities, resources, and conversion factors. This aligns well with reinforcement learning and planning algorithms used in LLM-based agents.\n* **Values and Needs Integration:**  The framework incorporates values and needs as *choice factors* influencing agent behavior, adding a layer of psychological realism and complexity to agent motivations beyond simple reward maximization. LLMs could be leveraged to model these values and needs based on individual profiles and social context.\n* **Policy Evaluation:**  The ABM simulates the impact of different policies on individuals' capabilities, allowing for comparison and evaluation of policy effectiveness. This approach could leverage LLMs to generate and evaluate a wide range of policy options.\n* **Social Simulation:** The focus on social context, interactions between stakeholders (PEH, social workers, non-profits), and legal/social norms opens up opportunities for complex social simulations using LLM-powered agents.  This allows for studying emergent behavior and the complex interplay of individual actions and social structures.\n* **Real-World Data Integration:** The plan to use real-world anonymized data and context-specific information suggests a data-driven approach to agent modeling and simulation. This is relevant to LLM-based agents, which can be trained and fine-tuned on such data to enhance their realism and predictive accuracy.",
  "takeaways": "This research paper presents a fascinating intersection of agent-based modeling, the Capability Approach (CA), and reinforcement learning, with a focus on simulating social policies.  Here's how a JavaScript developer working on LLM-based multi-agent applications can apply these insights:\n\n**1. Modeling Agent Capabilities and Deprivations:**\n\n* **CA as a Foundation:**  The paper maps CA concepts to a Markov Decision Process (MDP).  In a JavaScript multi-agent app, this translates to defining each agent's capabilities as a set of possible actions.  Deprivations are then represented as the *lack* of specific actions. For instance, an agent representing a person experiencing homelessness might lack the \"accessHealthcare\" action, while another might have it.\n* **LLMs for Dynamic Capabilities:** Instead of pre-defining all capabilities, LLMs can be used to generate context-dependent capabilities based on an agent's situation. For example, an LLM could assess an agentâ€™s current state (resources, environment) and suggest a list of realistic actions, dynamically generating its capability set.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**  Libraries like `langchain.js` and `llamaindex.js` provide tools for working with LLMs. You can use these to build an `Agent` class with a `capabilities` property, an array that gets populated dynamically by querying the LLM.\n\n```javascript\n// Conceptual example\nclass Agent {\n  constructor(name, initialResources, environment) {\n    this.name = name;\n    this.resources = initialResources;\n    this.environment = environment;\n    this.capabilities = this.getCapabilitiesFromLLM();\n  }\n\n  async getCapabilitiesFromLLM() {\n      // Use langchain.js or llamaindex.js to query LLM\n      // Provide context: this.resources, this.environment\n      // LLM returns a list of possible actions\n      // Example: [\"accessShelter\", \"seekEmployment\", \"accessHealthcare\"]\n      const actions = await queryLLM(...);\n      return actions;\n  }\n  // ... other methods\n}\n\n```\n\n**2. Implementing Choice Factors with LLMs:**\n\n* **Values and Needs:** The paper introduces values and needs as choice factors influencing agent decisions. This can be implemented by using LLMs to simulate how agents weigh different actions based on their individual values and urgent needs. For example, an agent valuing \"safety\" might prioritize \"accessShelter\" over \"seekEmployment,\" even if \"seekEmployment\" offers a higher long-term reward.\n* **Simulating Values and Needs:**  Provide prompts to the LLM that include the agent's current state, capabilities, and a set of possible actions.  The LLM can then predict which action the agent is most likely to choose based on predefined or learned value and need profiles.\n* **JavaScript Libraries:**  Utilize existing JavaScript libraries for sentiment analysis (e.g., `sentiment`) or build custom prompts for LLMs using libraries mentioned above to model value-driven decision-making.\n\n\n**3. Building a Web-Based Simulation Environment:**\n\n* **Visualization:**  Use JavaScript frameworks like `Three.js` or `D3.js` to create a visual representation of the agent-based simulation.  This can be as simple as dots representing agents moving around a map or a more complex 3D environment.\n* **User Interaction:** Allow users to interact with the simulation by setting initial conditions, adjusting policies (e.g., resource allocation), and observing the impact on agent capabilities and outcomes.  Frameworks like `React`, `Vue`, or `Angular` are ideal for building interactive web interfaces.\n* **Real-time Simulation:**  Consider using libraries like `socket.io` for real-time communication between the backend (simulation logic) and the frontend (visualization).\n\n**4. Evaluating Policy Effectiveness:**\n\n* **Metrics based on CA:**  Track metrics related to agent capabilities (e.g., the number of agents with \"accessHealthcare,\" average \"lifeExpectancy,\" etc.) over time under different policy scenarios. This allows for evaluating policies based on their impact on individuals' capabilities, as advocated by the CA.\n* **Data Visualization:** Visualize the results using charting libraries like `Chart.js` or `Plotly.js`, making it easy to understand the impact of various policies.\n\n**Challenges and Considerations:**\n\n* **LLM Hallucinations:**  Be mindful of potential inaccuracies or biases in LLM outputs. Validate and verify the LLM's generated capabilities and choices.\n* **Computational Resources:**  Agent-based simulations can be computationally intensive, especially with large numbers of agents and complex environments. Consider strategies for optimization and efficient use of resources.\n* **Ethical Implications:**  Social simulations can have ethical implications. Ensure the model is used responsibly and transparently, and consider potential biases in the data and algorithms.\n\nBy combining the theoretical framework of the CA with the power of LLMs and the flexibility of JavaScript, developers can create interactive and insightful simulations that help evaluate and design more effective social policies. This approach has the potential to revolutionize how we understand and address complex social challenges.",
