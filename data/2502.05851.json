  "title": "Fairness Driven Slot Allocation Problem in Billboard Advertisement",
  "abstract": "In billboard advertisement, a number of digital billboards are owned by an influence provider, and several commercial houses (which we call advertisers) approach the influence provider for a specific number of views of their advertisement content on a payment basis. Though the billboard slot allocation problem has been studied in the literature, this problem still needs to be addressed from a fairness point of view. In this paper, we introduce the FAIR BILLBOARD SLOT ALLOCATION Problem, where the objective is to allocate a given set of billboard slots among a group of advertisers based on their demands fairly and efficiently. As fairness criteria, we consider the maximin fair share, which ensures that each advertiser will receive a subset of slots that maximizes the minimum share for all the advertisers. We have proposed a solution approach that generates an allocation and provides an approximate maximum fair share. The proposed methodology has been analyzed to understand its time and space requirements and a performance guarantee. It has been implemented with real-world trajectory and billboard datasets, and the results have been reported. The results show that the proposed approach leads to a balanced allocation by satisfying the maximin fairness criteria. At the same time, it maximizes the utility of advertisers.",
  "summary": "This paper addresses fair allocation of billboard advertising slots to multiple advertisers.  It introduces the \"Fair Billboard Slot Allocation Problem\" and proposes an algorithm based on the concept of \"maximin fair share\" to ensure each advertiser gets a reasonable portion of slots based on their demand and budget.  Although not explicitly about LLMs, the paper's focus on resource allocation among multiple agents with varying demands and constraints is highly relevant to multi-agent LLM systems. The proposed algorithm and the concept of fairness could be adapted for managing resources like API calls, computation time, or memory among multiple LLM agents in a shared environment.  The paperâ€™s exploration of submodular valuation functions for influence maximization is analogous to optimizing the collective utility of multiple LLM agents working on a complex task.",
  "takeaways": "This paper introduces the concept of fairness in allocating billboard advertising slots, using the maximin fair share criterion. While the paper's context is billboard advertising, the underlying principles of fair resource allocation among multiple agents are directly applicable to LLM-based multi-agent systems in web development. Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights:\n\n**1. Fair Task Allocation among LLM Agents:**\n\nImagine a web application where multiple LLM agents collaborate on complex tasks, like content generation, code writing, or customer support.  Each agent may have different capabilities (e.g., specialized in different domains) and processing speeds.  Applying the maximin fair share principle ensures that no agent is consistently overloaded or underutilized.\n\n* **Practical Example:** A project management app uses LLM agents to summarize meeting transcripts, generate action items, and schedule follow-ups.  A JavaScript implementation could use a scheduling algorithm inspired by the paper's Algorithm 1 and 2.  It could estimate each agent's \"influence\" (processing speed) and \"cost\" (time taken), allocating tasks to maximize the minimum \"share\" of work done by each agent.\n\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** You could create an agent manager module. This module would receive task requests, assess agent availability and capabilities (potentially stored in a database or using a message queue like RabbitMQ), and then use a modified round-robin algorithm (from the paper) to distribute tasks fairly. Libraries like `async.js` or Promises can manage asynchronous task allocation and execution.\n\n**2. Distributed Resource Management:**\n\nIn serverless environments, multiple instances of LLM agents may compete for limited resources like memory, CPU, and API quotas. Applying fair allocation principles ensures efficient resource usage and prevents any single agent from starving others.\n\n* **Practical Example:** A real-time language translation app utilizes multiple LLM agents to handle concurrent translation requests. A JavaScript-based resource manager can allocate API tokens (representing access to the LLM service) among the agents based on the maximin fair share principle. This prevents one overly active agent from exhausting all tokens, ensuring fair access for all.\n\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**  Node.js with a library like `axios` for making API calls.  A central resource manager module monitors API usage and available tokens.  When an agent requests tokens, the manager uses a fair allocation algorithm to decide how many to grant, ensuring no agent gets an unfairly large share.\n\n**3. Collaborative Content Generation:**\n\nIn scenarios where multiple LLM agents collaboratively generate content (e.g., story writing, script development), fair allocation of \"creative control\" or \"contribution weight\" becomes crucial.\n\n* **Practical Example:** A collaborative fiction writing platform allows multiple users, each assisted by an LLM agent, to contribute to a story. Applying maximin fair share ensures that each agent (and hence each user) gets a fair opportunity to influence the narrative's direction, preventing one agent from dominating the story.\n\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** A front-end framework like React could manage the user interface, while a backend server using Node.js manages agent coordination. The server could implement a turn-taking mechanism or a weighted averaging system for combining agent contributions, inspired by the paper's allocation strategies.\n\n**4. Fair Access to External Data Sources:**\n\nIf multiple LLM agents access external APIs or databases, a fair allocation scheme prevents one agent from monopolizing the data source, ensuring everyone has timely access.\n\n* **Practical Example:**  A market research application utilizes LLM agents to analyze news articles and social media data.  A JavaScript manager distributes API keys or database connections fairly, based on each agent's estimated need and access frequency, preventing one agent from overwhelming the data source.\n\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**  Node.js and a database client library (e.g., `mongodb`, `pg`). The manager tracks each agent's data access requests and uses a fair allocation algorithm to grant access, potentially implementing a queuing mechanism to manage concurrent requests fairly.\n\n\nBy abstracting the core concepts of fair resource allocation and adapting the algorithms presented in the paper, JavaScript developers can create more robust, efficient, and equitable LLM-based multi-agent applications.  These examples illustrate just a few of the possibilities; the principles are widely applicable to diverse multi-agent scenarios in web development.",

It prioritizes allocating highly influential slots individually and then distributes the remaining slots in a round-robin fashion.\n\n* **Explanation:** The algorithm first identifies and allocates highly influential single slots to advertisers based on a threshold. Then, it iterates through the advertisers repeatedly, sampling a subset of available slots and allocating the slot that maximizes the marginal gain in influence for the current advertiser.\n\n**Algorithm 2: Approximate Maximin Fair Allocation for Submodular Valuation**\n\n* **Purpose:** This algorithm builds upon Algorithm 1 to provide a tighter approximation of the maximin fair share for submodular valuations.\n\n* **Explanation:** It initializes thresholds for each advertiser and iteratively calls Algorithm 1 to generate allocations.  If an advertiser's allocated influence doesn't meet a certain threshold related to their maximin share, the algorithm reduces the threshold and re-runs Algorithm 1. This process continues until all advertisers meet their respective adjusted thresholds.  This iterative adjustment allows for a fairer and more balanced allocation.",
