  "title": "Towards resilient cities: A hybrid simulation framework for risk mitigation through data-driven decision making",
  "abstract": "Providing a comprehensive view of the city operation and offering useful metrics for decision-making is a well-known challenge for urban risk-analysis systems. Existing systems are, in many cases, generalizations of previous domain specific tools/methodologies that may not cover all urban interdependencies and makes it difficult to have homogeneous indicators. In order to overcome this limitation while seeking for effective support to decision makers, this article introduces a novel hybrid simulation framework for risk mitigation. The framework is built on a proposed city concept that considers the urban space as a Complex Adaptive System composed by interconnected Critical Infrastructures. In this concept, a Social System, which models daily patterns and social interactions of the citizens in the Urban Landscape, drives the CIs demand to configure the full city picture. The framework's hybrid design integrates agent-based and network-based modeling by breaking down city agents into system-dependent subagents, to enable both inter and intra-system interaction simulation, respectively. A layered structure of indicators at different aggregation levels is also developed, to ensure that decisions are not only data-driven but also explainable. Therefore, the proposed simulation framework can serve as a DSS tool that allows the quantitative analysis of the impact of threats at different levels. First, system-level metrics can be used to get a broad view on the city resilience. Then, agent-level metrics back those figures and provide better explainability. On implementation, the proposed framework enables component reusability (for eased coding), simulation federation (enabling the integration of existing system-oriented simulators), discrete simulation in accelerated time (for rapid scenario simulation) and decision-oriented visualization (for informed outputs). The system built under the proposed approach facilitates to simulate various risk mitigation strategies for a scenario under analysis, allowing decision-makers to foresee potential outcomes. A case study has been deployed on a framework prototype to demonstrate how the DSS can be used in real-world situations, specifically combining cyber hazards over health and traffic infrastructures. The proposal aims at pushing the boundaries of urban city simulation towards more real, intelligent, and automated frameworks.",
  "summary": "This paper proposes a hybrid simulation framework for improving city resilience against risks like pandemics and cyberattacks. It models a city as interconnected critical infrastructures (energy, water, healthcare, ICT, transport, etc.) driven by a social system operating within an urban landscape.\n\nKey points for LLM-based multi-agent systems:\n\n* **Hybrid agent-based and network-based modeling:** Agents represent city entities (hospitals, citizens, etc.) with sub-agents interacting within different infrastructure networks (healthcare, ICT, etc.). This allows modeling both inter- and intra-system dependencies.  LLMs can enhance the agents' decision-making and communication capabilities.\n* **Layered metrics:**  Performance metrics are collected at entity, system, and city levels, allowing granular and holistic views of the city's operation.  LLMs can aid in interpreting these metrics and generating explanations for decision-makers.\n* **Simulation federation:** The framework supports integrating existing simulators (e.g., traffic simulators). LLMs can facilitate communication and data exchange between federated simulators.\n* **Discrete simulation in accelerated time:** Enables simulating long-term scenarios and exploring multiple \"what-if\" scenarios. LLMs can be used for scenario generation and analysis.\n* **Object-oriented design:** Promotes code reusability and simplifies model development.  LLM-based agents can be easily integrated into object-oriented frameworks.\n* **Focus on decision-making:** The framework aims to support risk-informed decision-making by providing quantitative insights. LLMs can augment decision-making by providing natural language explanations and recommendations.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents a valuable framework for structuring multi-agent systems in a way particularly relevant for web developers working with LLMs. Let's explore practical examples of how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights:\n\n**1. Modular Subagent Design with JavaScript Classes:**\n\nThe paper's concept of subagents, each responsible for a specific system interaction, translates beautifully into JavaScript classes.  Imagine building a multi-agent system for an e-commerce website where agents handle customer support, inventory management, and order processing.\n\n```javascript\nclass InventorySubagent {\n  constructor(productId, initialQuantity) {\n    this.productId = productId;\n    this.quantity = initialQuantity;\n  }\n\n  updateQuantity(change) {\n      this.quantity += change;\n  }\n\n  getQuantity() {\n        return this.quantity;\n  }\n\n  // ... other inventory-related methods ...\n}\n\n\nclass CustomerSupportSubagent {\n    constructor(llm) {\n        this.llm = llm; //  LLM instance for natural language processing\n    }\n\n\n    async handleCustomerQuery(query) {\n        const response = await this.llm.generateText(query); //Example LLM interaction\n        // Process and return response\n    }\n}\n\n\n\nclass ECommerceAgent {\n    constructor(productId, initialQuantity, llm) {\n        this.inventorySubagent = new InventorySubagent(productId, initialQuantity);\n        this.customerSupportSubagent = new CustomerSupportSubagent(llm);\n        // ... other subagents\n    }\n\n    async processOrder(order) {\n        //Example Agent Interaction between subagents\n        this.inventorySubagent.updateQuantity(-order.quantity);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis modularity promotes code reusability and maintainability, central tenets of good JavaScript development.\n\n**2. Inter-Agent Communication with Message Passing (e.g., using Socket.IO):**\n\nThe paper highlights the importance of inter-agent communication. In a web context, this can be achieved using real-time communication libraries like Socket.IO.  Consider a collaborative writing application where each user is represented by an agent. Subagents might handle text editing, user presence, and collaborative features. Socket.IO facilitates seamless message passing between these agents, enabling real-time updates and synchronization.\n\n```javascript\n// Server-side (Node.js with Socket.IO)\nio.on('connection', (socket) => {\n\n  socket.on('text_edit', (data) => {\n    // Broadcast changes to other agents\n    socket.broadcast.emit('text_update', data);\n  });\n  // ... other Socket.IO event handlers ...\n});\n\n\n// Client-side (JavaScript with Socket.IO)\nsocket.on('text_update', (data) => {\n    //Update client text area with updates from the other agents\n});\n\n\n\n```\n\n**3. System-Level Metrics and Visualization with D3.js:**\n\nThe paper emphasizes system-level metrics and visualization for decision-making. D3.js, a powerful JavaScript visualization library, is ideal for this purpose. You could visualize system health, agent activity, or resource utilization in real-time dashboards, providing valuable insights for monitoring and managing your multi-agent application.\n\n\n\n**4. Simulating Hazards and Testing Resilience:**\n\nThe framework's ability to simulate hazards is essential for building robust multi-agent systems. You can simulate network outages, unexpected user behavior, or data corruption by programmatically altering agent states or communication channels.  This allows testing your system's resilience under various conditions and implementing appropriate error handling and recovery mechanisms within your JavaScript agents.\n\n\n\n**5. Integrating with Existing Simulators and LLMs:**\n\nThe paper's suggestion of simulator federation is valuable for complex web applications. You can integrate your multi-agent JavaScript code with specialized simulators, LLM APIs, or other back-end services through APIs or message queues.  This extends the functionality and enhances the realism of your simulations. Consider integrating your e-commerce example with a sophisticated inventory management system, or the collaborative writing application with LLM-based grammar checking or style suggestions.\n\n\n\n**Example: LLM-powered Chatbot Agents for a Conference Website**\n\nImagine a conference website with multiple chatbot agents, each powered by an LLM, dedicated to specific tasks: schedule information, speaker bios, venue directions, and registration support.\n\n*   **Subagents:** Each chatbot agent would have subagents for natural language understanding, LLM interaction, response generation, and context management.\n*   **Inter-agent communication:** If a user asks a question outside a chatbot's domain, it could pass the query to a more suitable agent.\n*   **System-level metrics:** Track response times, user satisfaction, and query topics to monitor system performance.\n*   **Hazard simulation:** Simulate high traffic or complex queries to test system resilience.\n\nBy applying this paper's framework, JavaScript developers can create well-structured, resilient, and scalable LLM-based multi-agent applications for diverse web development scenarios.  The key takeaway is the power of modular design, inter-agent communication, and system-level monitoring, which are all achievable using existing JavaScript tools and technologies.",
  "pseudocode": "I've reviewed the provided research paper and identified several equation-like descriptions of algorithms, though not strictly in pseudocode format.  I'll translate these into JavaScript and explain their purpose.\n\n**1. Subagent State Evolution (Equation 4):**\n\n```javascript\nfunction updateSubagentState(subagent, time) {\n  // Get states of relevant other subagents at the current time step.\n  const otherSubagentsInSystem = subagent.system.getSubagents(time);\n  const otherSubagentsInAgent = subagent.agent.getSubagents(time);\n\n  // Apply internal rules (IR)\n  subagent.state = subagent.IR(subagent.parameters, subagent.state);\n\n  // Apply system interaction rules (SR)\n  subagent.state = subagent.SR(subagent.state, otherSubagentsInSystem);\n\n  // Apply agent interaction rules (AR)\n  subagent.state = subagent.AR(subagent.state, otherSubagentsInAgent);\n}\n\n\n```\n\n* **Purpose:** This function updates the state of a subagent based on its internal rules (IR), interactions within its system (SR), and interactions within its parent agent (AR).  It models how a subagent's behavior changes over time due to internal factors and external influences. The `time` parameter ensures that interactions are based on the current state of the system. The functions `IR`, `SR`, and `AR` would be implemented specifically for each subagent type, representing the rules governing their behavior and interactions.\n\n\n**2. Subagent Metric Observation (Equation 5):**\n\n```javascript\nfunction getSubagentMetrics(subagent) {\n  return subagent.OB(subagent.state);\n}\n```\n\n* **Purpose:** This function retrieves metrics from a subagent's state using its observability function (OB). It models how we extract measurable information from the subagent's internal state.  The `OB` function is specific to each subagent and defines how its internal state translates into observable metrics.\n\n\n**3. System-Level Metric Aggregation (Equation 8):**\n\n```javascript\nfunction getSystemMetrics(system, time) {\n  const subagentStates = system.getSubagents(time).map(subagent => subagent.state);\n  return system.AOB(subagentStates);\n}\n```\n\n* **Purpose:** This function aggregates metrics from all subagents within a system at a specific time step to calculate system-level metrics.  The `AOB` (Aggregated Observability) function is specific to each system and defines how to combine individual subagent metrics into a system-level metric.\n\n\n**4. System Service Level Calculation (Equation 9):**\n\n```javascript\n\nfunction getSystemServiceLevel(system, time) {\n  const subagentStates = system.getSubagents(time).map(subagent => subagent.state);\n  return system.SA(subagentStates);\n}\n\n```\n\n* **Purpose:** This function calculates the Service Level (SL) of a system, which represents its overall performance at a specific time step.  It uses a system-specific aggregation function (`SA`) that combines subagent states into a single value between 0 and 1, representing the degradation of service (0 being complete failure, 1 being perfect operation).\n\n\n\n**5. Hazardous Event (Equation 10):**\n\n```javascript\n\nclass Hazard {\n  constructor(hazardType, startTime, affectedSubagent, parameters) {\n    this.hazardType = hazardType;\n    this.startTime = startTime;\n    this.affectedSubagent = affectedSubagent;\n    this.parameters = parameters;\n  }\n}\n\nfunction applyHazard(hazard, time) {\n  if (time >= hazard.startTime) {\n     // Apply the hazard to the affected subagent. This could involve modifying the subagent's state or parameters.\n     hazard.affectedSubagent.applyHazardEffect(hazard.hazardType, hazard.parameters);\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n* **Purpose:** This code defines a `Hazard` class to represent a hazardous event. Each hazard has a type, a start time, the affected subagent, and parameters defining the hazard's specifics. The `applyHazard` function checks the current time and, if the hazard's start time has passed, applies its effects on the designated subagent.  The exact implementation of `applyHazardEffect` would be specific to each subagent and hazard type.\n\n\nThis translation and explanation provide a JavaScript-oriented interpretation of the algorithms presented in the research paper, bridging the gap between the theoretical concepts and practical implementation for a software engineer building a multi-agent system. It is important to remember that these are simplified representations, and real-world implementations would require more complex logic and data structures. However, they serve as a good starting point for understanding the core ideas and translating them into code.",
