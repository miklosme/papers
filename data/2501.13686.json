  "title": "LEARNING IN CONJECTURAL STACKELBERG GAMES",
  "abstract": "We extend the formalism of Conjectural Variations games to Stackelberg games involving multiple leaders and a single follower. To solve these nonconvex games, a common assumption is that the leaders compute their strategies having perfect knowledge of the follower's best response. However, in practice, the leaders may have little to no knowledge about the other players' reactions. To deal with this lack of knowledge, we assume that each leader can form conjectures about the other players' best responses, and update its strategy relying on these conjectures. Our contributions are twofold: (i) On the theoretical side, we introduce the concept of Conjectural Stackelberg Equilibrium – keeping our formalism conjecture agnostic with Stackelberg Equilibrium being a refinement of it. (ii) On the algorithmic side, we introduce a two-stage algorithm with guarantees of convergence, which allows the leaders to first learn conjectures on a training data set, and then update their strategies. Theoretical results are illustrated numerically.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces Conjectural Stackelberg Games (CSG), a game-theoretic model where multiple leader agents make decisions while anticipating the reactions of a follower agent, and also anticipate each other's actions through learned conjectures.  A two-stage algorithm called COSTAL is presented, where agents first learn conjectures about other agents' responses and then iteratively update their own strategies based on these learned conjectures. Key points for LLM-based multi-agent systems include: agents don't need perfect knowledge of other agents' behaviors; conjectures, learned from training data, can replace best-response calculations; convergence guarantees are provided for the learning algorithm; and the approach is computationally tractable, even with many agents. This opens possibilities for using CSGs as a framework for LLM-based multi-agent applications, where accurate prediction of others' behavior is difficult or expensive.",
  "takeaways": "This research paper introduces the concept of Conjectural Stackelberg Equilibria (CSE) in multi-agent systems, where agents make conjectures about other agents' responses, particularly relevant for LLM-based agents which may not have perfect knowledge of each other's decision-making.  Here are practical examples of how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights to LLM-based multi-agent projects:\n\n**1. Collaborative Content Creation:** Imagine a web application where multiple LLM agents are co-authoring a document. Each agent can be modeled as a leader, and the final document aggregator as a follower.\n\n* **CSE Implementation:**  Each LLM agent (leader) could use a simplified model (e.g., a small neural network or even an affine function) to predict how other agents will modify the document based on their previous edits. This conjecture model (ψ(x_i)) can be trained in JavaScript using TensorFlow.js or Brain.js.  The training data would consist of previous editing sessions.\n* **JavaScript Framework:** A framework like React could manage the document's state and UI updates as agents make changes. Node.js could handle backend communication between agents.\n* **Benefit:** Instead of relying on a centralized coordinator that dictates edits, each agent can act more autonomously, predicting and adapting to each other’s contributions.\n\n**2. Multi-User Game Development:**  Consider developing a real-time strategy game where players control LLM-powered units. Each player and their units would be a leader, and the game engine enforcing game rules would be the follower.\n\n* **CSE Implementation:** Each player's LLM agent could have a conjecture model, perhaps a recurrent neural network (RNN) implemented with TensorFlow.js, predicting opponent unit movements based on game state and observed behavior. This allows for more strategic gameplay without direct access to opponent information.\n* **JavaScript Framework:** Phaser or Babylon.js could be used for game rendering and physics. Socket.IO would manage real-time communication.\n* **Benefit:**  CSE offers a decentralized approach to strategy. Instead of computing a perfect best response to the unknown opponent strategies (which is computationally expensive), agents learn simplified models of opponent behavior, enabling quicker, more adaptive actions.\n\n**3. Decentralized E-commerce Negotiation:** In a marketplace with multiple buyer and seller agents (leaders), the platform (follower) enforces transactions and sets fees.\n\n* **CSE Implementation:** Each buyer agent could use a conjecture model to predict how seller agents will adjust their prices based on market demand and competitor pricing. This could be implemented using a regression model in JavaScript.\n* **JavaScript Framework:**  Node.js could power the backend and communicate with the agents. A frontend framework like Vue.js could display market information.\n* **Benefit:**  Agents can negotiate prices more efficiently without needing to know each other's precise utility functions.\n\n**4. Personalized Recommendation Systems:**  Multiple recommender agents (leaders) can personalize suggestions for a single user (follower) based on their preferences.\n\n* **CSE Implementation:** Each recommender agent, specializing in a category (e.g., movies, books, music), would have a conjecture model to predict the recommendations of other agents.  This avoids redundant suggestions and ensures diversity.\n* **JavaScript Framework:** React could handle the frontend and manage user interactions.\n* **Benefit:** CSE would allow for a more balanced and diverse set of recommendations, anticipating potential overlap from other recommenders.\n\n**Key Considerations for JavaScript Developers:**\n\n* **Model Complexity:**  Choose conjecture models (ψ) appropriate for your application's complexity and computational resources. Start simple and increase complexity if necessary.\n* **Training Data:**  Collect relevant data to train conjecture models.  Log agent interactions and game states.\n* **Evaluation:** Measure the performance of the multi-agent system with different conjecture models to determine effectiveness.\n\n\nBy applying the concepts of CSE, JavaScript developers can build more robust and efficient LLM-based multi-agent systems that can operate in complex, dynamic web environments. The COSTAL algorithm, while presented in a theoretical context, offers inspiration for JavaScript developers on how to approach the practical training and implementation of conjecture models within their applications. Remember to simplify and adapt the algorithm to the specific needs and constraints of your project.",

The provided code initializes them as simple functions returning zero. You'll likely replace these with your chosen model structures and initialization procedures.\n    2. **Data Collection (Lines 2-15):**  Iterates `T` times, sampling random actions for all leaders, computing the true best response of the follower (using the `computeBestResponse` function), adding noise, and storing these (action, reaction) pairs in datasets.\n    3. **Conjecture Training (Line 16):** Uses the collected datasets to train the conjecture functions. The `trainConjecture` function is a placeholder, and you should implement your model's training procedure here. You'll use the sampled leader actions (`x_i_tilde`) as input and the reactions of other leaders/follower (`x[j]`, `y_tilde`) as the target output for the conjecture models.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** The provided JavaScript code provides a structure for implementing this algorithm. Key points:\n    * The code uses nested arrays to represent the conjectures (one for each leader, and within that, one for each other agent they need to form a conjecture about).\n    * The `gaussianNoise` function adds Gaussian noise to the best responses, simulating imperfect information.\n    * The `trainConjecture` function is a placeholder. You must replace this with your actual training method using machine learning libraries or custom implementations.\n\n**Algorithm 2: Learning Conjectural Stackelberg Equilibrium**\n\n* **Purpose:**  This algorithm uses the trained conjectures from Algorithm 1 to find a Conjectural Stackelberg Equilibrium (CSE), which is a stable state in the game where each leader chooses the best strategy given their predictions of other agents' behavior (as captured by the conjectures).\n* **Algorithm:**\n    1. **Initialization:** Starts with random initial strategies for the leaders.\n    2. **Iterative Updates (Lines 3-10):**  Iterates `T` times. In each iteration, each leader updates their strategy by following the gradient of their *conjectured* objective function (i.e., the objective function where the actions of others are replaced by the predictions of their respective conjectures). The step size of the gradient descent is controlled by `eta`. The new x value is clipped.\n\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    *  The code calculates the gradient of the leader's objective function numerically using finite differences in `gradient`, `gradientwrtOpponents`, `gradientwrtFollower`.  In a real implementation, you would likely use automatic differentiation provided by deep learning libraries if using complex models.\n    *  The `updates` array stores the gradient for each leader.\n    * The gradient descent update is done within the loop.\n\n**Key improvements and considerations:**\n\n* **Modularity and Reusability:** The JavaScript code is structured with functions, promoting code reusability and organization.\n* **Customizable Conjectures:** You can plug in various conjecture models (linear, polynomial, neural networks, etc.) by simply modifying the `trainConjecture` function and initializing the `conjectures` array appropriately.\n* **Numerical Gradients:** The current implementation uses numerical gradients. For better performance, especially with complex models, consider using automatic differentiation offered by libraries like TensorFlow.js.\n* **Parallelism:** The conjecture training and strategy updates within each iteration can be parallelized to improve performance, especially with a larger number of agents.\n\n\nThis detailed breakdown should provide a strong foundation for JavaScript developers to understand, implement, and experiment with Conjectural Stackelberg Games using the provided code structure. Remember to replace placeholder functions and adapt the code to your specific conjecture models and problem domain.",
