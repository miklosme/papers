  "title": "A Case Study of Counting the Number of Unique Users in Linear and Non-Linear Trails - A Multi-Agent System Approach",
  "abstract": "Parks are an important factor in maintaining or increasing the quality of living for an area. Understanding when, how many, and in what ways people use any given park is very important for taking the necessary steps not just for security measures, but providing the users with facilities like clean washrooms, sitting arrangements, and repairing the paths. Park authorities count the number of daily users by using single entry sensors which add to the total count each time it gets a hit. However, understanding the activities of unique users while within the park is something that is typically not done due to lack of manpower and expense. Today, the wide availability of cheap video cameras and inexpensive on-board, networked processing brings with it the possibility of a deeper understanding of park use by a community. Hence, we propose a multi-agent system approach to analyze the activities of unique users of any park using inexpensive cameras on a distributed system. We have used the Jack A. Markell (JAM) Trail in Wilmington, Delaware, and Hall Trail in Newark, Delaware as a case study for validating our approach. First, we installed a set of video cameras, recorded the video input for a fixed period of time, and then we processed this data autonomously, using existing algorithms, and used that to count the unique users of the park and their activities during the time period. Our approach used different attributes of the users like their speed, direction, activity types, color of their dress, gender etc to identify unique users. The cameras share the attributes while communicating one another, and then the construction of the trails of unique users is done centrally. We validated our results against a human count of unique users, and also developed a simulation to test our approach under varying conditions. Our work has actually set a benchmark for this type of work as it is the first of its kind. We have identified several challenges in this application, and have above a seventy(72) percent success rate for our approach.",
  "summary": "This research explores counting unique park visitors using a multi-agent system of inexpensive cameras and distributed processing.  The system analyzes visitor attributes like speed, direction, clothing color, and activity to identify individuals, constructing trails and comparing data between camera agents to avoid double-counting.  Key points for LLM-based multi-agent systems include: distributed attribute collection and central processing, agent communication for unique user identification and trail construction, and potential for energy saving through selective agent activation based on predicted arrival times. The authors highlight the systemâ€™s affordability and potential for real-time online implementation, eliminating data storage needs and privacy concerns.",
  "takeaways": "This paper explores counting unique users in a physical space (a park) using a multi-agent system (MAS) approach. While the paper uses traditional sensors, its core concepts translate well to LLM-based multi-agent web applications.  Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply the insights:\n\n**1. Attribute Selection for Agent Communication:**\n\n* **Paper's Insight:** The research emphasizes selecting the most relevant attributes for efficient communication between agents, minimizing data transfer and processing.  They use entropy to prioritize attributes.\n* **JavaScript Application:**  In a web app, agents (represented by JavaScript objects or classes) might be chatbots, personalized recommendation engines, or collaborative content creators.  Efficient communication is crucial.  Instead of sending entire LLM outputs between agents, identify key features (e.g., sentiment, topic keywords, user preferences) to share.  Libraries like TensorFlow.js can help calculate entropy or other metrics for attribute selection.\n\n```javascript\n// Example: Agent communication with selected attributes\nclass Agent {\n  constructor(id) { this.id = id; }\n  processMessage(message) {\n    // ... (LLM processing) ...\n    const keyAttributes = this.extractKeyAttributes(message); // Entropy-based selection\n    this.sendMessageToOtherAgents(keyAttributes); \n  }\n  // ... other methods ...\n}\n```\n\n**2. Trail Tracking and User Identification:**\n\n* **Paper's Insight:** The paper creates \"trails\" of user activity by correlating observations from different sensor locations over time. This helps identify unique individuals.\n* **JavaScript Application:** In a web app, you can track user journeys through different pages or interactions. Imagine a multi-agent e-commerce site: each product recommendation agent can contribute to a user's \"preference trail\" based on product views, searches, and cart additions.  This trail can be stored in a central database (e.g., using Node.js and MongoDB) and used to build a more complete user profile.\n\n```javascript\n// Example: Updating a user's preference trail\nfunction updatePreferenceTrail(userId, productCategory, action) {\n  // Store data in a database: { userId, timestamp, productCategory, action }\n  // ... (Database interaction code - e.g., MongoDB) ...\n}\n```\n\n**3. Energy Efficiency (Resource Management):**\n\n* **Paper's Insight:**  The research explores strategies to activate sensors only when necessary to conserve energy.\n* **JavaScript Application:** LLMs are resource-intensive.  Activate agents (and their associated LLM calls) strategically.  Instead of constantly running LLMs, use lighter-weight heuristics or rules to filter requests. Only engage the LLM when the complexity demands it.  Consider serverless functions (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions) for on-demand agent activation.\n\n```javascript\n// Example: Conditional LLM usage\nfunction processUserQuery(query) {\n  if (isSimpleQuery(query)) {\n    // Handle with simple rules or a cached response\n  } else {\n    // Trigger LLM processing (e.g., serverless function call)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**4. Distributed System Architecture:**\n\n* **Paper's Insight:** The multi-agent system is distributed, enabling parallel processing and fault tolerance.\n* **JavaScript Application:** Design your web application with a microservices architecture. Each agent can run as a separate service (e.g., using Docker and Kubernetes).  Message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) can facilitate communication between agents.  This distributed approach enhances scalability and robustness.\n\n**5. Practical Example: Collaborative Story Writing Web App:**\n\nImagine building a web app where multiple LLM-powered agents collaboratively write a story. Each agent specializes in a genre (e.g., mystery, romance, sci-fi).  Users provide a starting prompt, and the agents take turns contributing to the narrative.  The principles from the paper can be applied:\n\n* **Attribute Selection:** Agents share only key plot points, character descriptions, and emotional tones, not entire paragraphs.\n* **Trail Tracking:**  The story's progress forms a \"narrative trail\" that's centrally stored.\n* **Resource Management:** Agents are activated only when it's their turn to contribute, minimizing LLM usage.\n* **Distributed System:** Agents run as separate services, enabling parallel writing and preventing a single agent's failure from halting the story's creation.\n\nBy applying these concepts, JavaScript developers can create innovative and efficient LLM-based multi-agent web applications that are inspired by cutting-edge research.  The key is to adapt the principles to the web context and leverage the power of JavaScript frameworks and libraries to implement the system effectively.",

It utilizes a `Sensor` class, with methods for observing users, extracting their attributes, notifying neighbors, calculating arrival times, and comparing attributes.  The code assumes that sensors have access to user attributes (like speed, color of dress, etc.) through some external mechanism. The  `compareAttributes` function checks if two sets of attributes are the same. The `receiveNotification` function receives observations from neighboring sensors along with estimated arrival times and compares the incoming observation with its stored observations to identify unique users or create trails. It also includes some basic sensor communication logic using the `notifyNeighbors` and `receiveNotification` methods.  The `calculateArrivalTime` uses a simple distance/speed calculation.\n\n\n\nThis is a skeletal implementation.  In a real-world scenario, the `extractAttributes` function would likely use more sophisticated image processing and/or machine learning models to derive user attributes from sensor data.  Trail creation logic (not fully implemented here) would involve storing and managing sequences of sensor observations associated with individual users. Also error handling and robust timestamping should be incorporated. The code lacks the centralized component for consolidating information from all sensors.  This centralized agent would be responsible for making final determinations of uniqueness and managing global trail information.",
