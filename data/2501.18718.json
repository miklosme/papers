  "title": "Distributed Offloading in Multi-Access Edge Computing Systems: A Mean-Field Perspective",
  "abstract": "Abstract-With the widespread adoption of internet-of-things (IoT) devices capable of supporting numerous intelligent applications, the demand for computational power has surged dramatically. Multi-access edge computing (MEC) technology is a promising solution to assist the often power-constrained IoT devices by providing additional computing resources for time-sensitive tasks. In this paper, we consider the problem of optimal task offloading in MEC systems with due consideration of the timeliness and scalability issues under two scenarios of equitable and priority access to the edge server (ES). In the first scenario, we consider a MEC system consisting of N devices assisted by one ES, where the devices can split task execution between a local processor and the ES, with equitable access to the ES. In the second scenario, we consider a MEC system consisting of one primary user, N secondary users and one ES. The primary user has priority access to the ES while the secondary users have equitable access to the ES amongst themselves. In both scenarios, due to the power consumption associated with utilizing the local resource and task offloading, the devices must optimize their actions. Additionally, since the ES is a shared resource, other users' offloading activity serves to increase latency incurred by each user. We thus model both scenarios using a large user non-cooperative game framework. However, the presence of a large number of users makes it nearly impossible to compute the equilibrium offloading policies for each user, which would require a significant communication overhead to exchange information with each other. Thus, to alleviate such scalability issues, we invoke the paradigm of mean-field games to design completely distributed low complexity algorithms for the computation of approximate Nash equilibrium policies for each user based on only their local information. Further, by leveraging the novel age of information (AoI) metric, we study the trade-offs between increasing information freshness and reducing power consumption for each user. Using numerical evaluations, we show that our approach can recover the offloading trends displayed under centralized solutions, and provide additional insights into the results obtained.",
  "summary": "This paper explores optimized task offloading in multi-access edge computing (MEC).  Devices decide how much computation to perform locally versus offloading to a shared edge server, balancing power consumption and data freshness (age of information).  To handle large numbers of devices, the researchers apply mean-field game theory, allowing for distributed decision-making based only on individual device information and statistical system properties, eliminating the need for complex inter-device communication. A priority-access scenario is also considered, using major-minor mean-field games to model the influence of a primary user.  The mean-field approach provides scalable, decentralized computation offloading strategies relevant to large-scale multi-agent systems. The focus on individual agents reacting to global system statistics mirrors potential interactions in LLM-based multi-agent scenarios.  The proposed distributed algorithms and consideration of resource contention offer valuable insights for developing similar systems with LLMs.",
  "takeaways": "This research paper presents valuable insights for JavaScript developers working with LLM-based multi-agent applications, particularly in optimizing resource allocation and managing communication overhead. Here are some practical examples applied to web development scenarios:\n\n**1. Decentralized Task Offloading in Collaborative Editing:**\n\nImagine a collaborative document editing application like Google Docs, but powered by multiple LLMs acting as agents. Each agent could specialize in a specific task, such as grammar correction, style suggestion, or content generation.  This paper's mean-field game theory approach can be used to distribute the workload among these agents dynamically.\n\n* **Scenario:** Multiple users are editing a document simultaneously. Each user's browser hosts a JavaScript client that interacts with a set of LLM agents.\n* **Implementation:** Use a message broker like Socket.IO or Redis to facilitate real-time communication between the client and agents. Implement the offloading algorithm in JavaScript, deciding whether to process a task locally (in the browser) or offload it to an LLM agent based on current load and agent availability.  Track metrics like CPU usage, latency, and agent queue lengths to inform offloading decisions.\n* **Benefits:** Reduced latency for users, efficient use of LLM resources, improved scalability of the application.\n\n**2. Prioritized Content Delivery in a News Feed:**\n\nConsider a personalized news feed application where multiple LLM agents curate and rank news articles based on user preferences.  The priority-based access model discussed in the paper can be applied here to prioritize critical updates or breaking news.\n\n* **Scenario:** A user is browsing a news feed. LLMs generate personalized content and push updates to the user's browser.  Breaking news requires immediate delivery.\n* **Implementation:**  Implement a priority queue in JavaScript on the client-side to manage incoming updates.  Use service workers to handle background updates and push notifications. The server-side should prioritize delivery of critical news using the LCFS-PP discipline described in the paper.\n* **Benefits:** Ensures that critical information reaches users in a timely manner, even if the network is congested or the user is offline.\n\n**3. Multi-Agent Chat Application with Specialized Bots:**\n\nImagine a customer support chat application where multiple specialized LLM bots handle different types of inquiries.  The mean-field approach can be used to dynamically route user messages to the appropriate bot based on the bot's expertise and current workload.\n\n* **Scenario:**  Users interact with a chat interface.  LLMs specialize in areas like product information, billing support, or technical assistance.\n* **Implementation:**  Use a JavaScript framework like React or Vue.js to build the chat interface. Implement a routing algorithm in JavaScript that uses a mean-field approximation to distribute user requests among the available bots.  Track bot response times and queue lengths to dynamically adjust routing.\n* **Benefits:** Improved customer experience by connecting users with the most relevant bot quickly, efficient use of bot resources, increased scalability of the customer support system.\n\n\n**JavaScript Frameworks/Libraries:**\n\n* **TensorFlow.js:** For running LLM inference locally in the browser.\n* **Web Workers:** For offloading tasks to background threads and improving client-side performance.\n* **Socket.IO, Redis:** For real-time communication between clients and LLM agents.\n* **React, Vue.js:** For building interactive user interfaces for multi-agent applications.\n\n**Key Concepts for JavaScript Developers:**\n\n* **Mean-Field Approximation:** Treat the behavior of the entire system of agents as a single average field.\n* **Decentralized Optimization:** Agents make decisions based on local information and the mean-field.\n* **Priority-Based Access:** Prioritize certain agents or tasks based on importance.\n\nBy adopting the insights from this paper, JavaScript developers can build more efficient, scalable, and responsive LLM-based multi-agent web applications that deliver a better user experience. Remember that experimenting with different offloading strategies, priority schemes, and communication protocols is key to finding the optimal solution for your specific application.",

It iteratively updates the offloading policy (probability of offloading `p`, local processing rate `mu1`, transmission rate `mu2`) for each device type and the mean-field term `p` (representing the load on the edge server) until convergence.  It uses a fixed-point iteration approach combined with a block coordinate gradient descent to find the optimal policy for each device type. The key components are:\n\n1. **Initialization:** Initializes the mean-field term `p` and the policies for each device type (`sigma`) randomly.\n\n2. **Outer Loop (Mean-Field Update):** Iterates until the mean-field term `p` converges.\n\n3. **Inner Loop (Policy Update):** For each device type, it iteratively updates its policy using gradient descent on the cost function `Jp`. The gradient calculations are placeholders and need to be replaced with the actual gradients derived in the paper. The updates are projected onto the feasible region defined by the constraints.\n\n\n4. **Krasnoselskij's Iteration:** Updates the mean-field term `p` based on the current policies of all device types, ensuring consistency.\n\n\n**Purpose of Algorithm 1:**\n\nThe purpose is to compute a distributed offloading policy that approximates the Nash Equilibrium in a large-scale MEC system. The MFE approach reduces the complexity of finding the NE by considering the interaction of a generic device with the average behavior of the entire population (represented by the mean-field term). This allows each device to make decisions based on local information and the mean-field, eliminating the need for communication and coordination with all other devices.\n\n\nAlgorithms 2 and 3 have similar structures but are tailored for their respective game setups: Algorithm 2 computes the Nash Equilibrium for the N-player game, while Algorithm 3 computes the MM-MFE for the game with priority access (primary and secondary users). They all involve iterative updates of policies and mean-field terms, using gradient-based optimization to minimize cost functions. The JavaScript implementations for these algorithms would be similar to Algorithm 1, with the appropriate modifications to cost functions, constraints, and update steps according to the problem formulations in the paper.",
