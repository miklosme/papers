  "title": "Consensus Tracking Control of Multi-agent Systems with A Time-varying Reference State under Binary-valued Communication",
  "abstract": "Abstract-This paper investigates the problem of consensus tracking control of discrete-time multi-agent systems under binary-valued communication. Different from most existing studies on consensus tracking, the transmitted information between agents is binary-valued. Parameter identification with binary-valued observations is applied to the estimation of neighbors' states and the tracking control is designed based on the estimation. Two Lyapunov functions are constructed to deal with the strong coupling of estimation and control. Compared with consensus problems under binary-valued communication, a reference state is required for consensus tracking control. Two scenarios of the time-varying reference state are studied respectively. (1) The reference state is asymptotically convergent. An online algorithm that performs estimation and control simultaneously is proposed, in which the estimation step size and the control gain are decreasing with time. By this algorithm, the multi-agent system is proved to achieve consensus tracking with convergence rate O(1/k) under certain conditions. (2) The reference state is bounded, which is less conservative than that in the first case. In this case, the estimation step size and control gain are designed to be constant. By this algorithm, all the followers can reach to a neighborhood of the leader with an exponential rate. Finally, simulations are given to demonstrate theoretical results.",
  "summary": "This paper explores how multiple agents can work together to follow a leader, even when they only receive very limited, binary (0 or 1) information about each other's positions.  It offers algorithms for two scenarios: when the leader's position eventually settles down and when the leader's position stays within a certain range.\n\nFor LLM-based multi-agent systems, this research is relevant because it addresses the challenge of coordinating agents with limited communication bandwidth.  The binary communication model could be analogous to agents receiving only simplified, high-level feedback or instructions.  This work could be extended to consider more complex information exchange, such as the limited token exchanges typically seen in LLM interactions, and the algorithms offer a starting point for developing coordination strategies in such environments.",
  "takeaways": "This paper explores consensus tracking control in multi-agent systems using binary communication, a highly relevant area for web developers building LLM-based multi-agent applications.  Here are practical examples demonstrating how JavaScript developers can apply these insights:\n\n**Scenario 1: Collaborative Content Creation with LLMs**\n\nImagine a web app where multiple users (agents) collaboratively write a story using LLMs. Each user's input is processed by a local LLM, generating text snippets.  Binary feedback (upvote/downvote or accept/reject) from other users informs the local LLMs about the desirability of each snippet.  The goal is to achieve consensus on the storyline and writing style.\n\n* **Applying the Paper's Insights:**\n    * **Binary Communication:** Implement the binary feedback mechanism using simple JavaScript events and data structures. For example, a “thumbs up” could send a “1”, and a “thumbs down” a “0”.\n    * **Estimation:** Use a JavaScript-based implementation of RPA (Recursive Projection Algorithm) to estimate other agents' \"states\" based on the limited binary feedback.  The \"state\" could be a vector representation of the writing style and thematic elements preferred by each user. Libraries like TensorFlow.js can be helpful for this.\n    * **Control:** Adjust the local LLM's parameters (e.g., temperature, top-p) based on the estimated states of other users.  For instance, if the majority of users prefer a more creative style, increase the temperature of the local LLM.\n    * **Asymptotically Convergent Reference State:**  A designated user or a \"moderator bot\" powered by a more sophisticated LLM could provide an evolving reference state (e.g., storyline suggestions, style guidelines).  The other users’ local LLMs would gradually converge to this reference state.\n\n**Scenario 2: Decentralized Task Management with LLMs**\n\nConsider a project management app where multiple LLM agents (each representing a team member) need to coordinate on tasks. Each agent receives a stream of tasks and needs to decide which tasks to prioritize. The agents communicate with each other using binary signals (e.g., task availability, dependency notifications).\n\n* **Applying the Paper's Insights:**\n    * **Bounded Reference State:** Define a global project goal as a bounded reference state (e.g., a set of milestones).  The individual LLM agents would strive to achieve this goal while operating within their constraints.\n    * **Constant Step-Sizes & Gains:** Use constant parameters for estimation and control due to the bounded reference state.  This simplifies the implementation in JavaScript and ensures stability.\n    * **Decentralized Control:** Each LLM agent independently makes decisions based on local information and binary communication with other agents.  This avoids a single point of failure and improves scalability.\n\n\n**JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries**\n\n* **TensorFlow.js:** Useful for implementing RPA, vector representations, and manipulating LLM parameters.\n* **Socket.IO:**  Facilitates real-time binary communication between agents in a web application context.\n* **Node.js:** Enables building server-side logic for multi-agent communication and coordination.\n* **React, Vue, or Angular:**  Can be used for building the front-end UI of the multi-agent application.\n\n**Key Advantages for JavaScript Developers**\n\n* **Simplified Communication:** Binary communication is easier to implement and requires less bandwidth.\n* **Improved Scalability:** Decentralized control enhances scalability for larger numbers of agents.\n* **Robustness:**  The algorithms are designed to handle noisy and incomplete information.\n\n**Experimenting with JavaScript**\n\nStart by implementing a simplified version of the RPA algorithm in JavaScript using a numerical example. Then, integrate it with a basic LLM (e.g., a small language model running client-side) and experiment with binary feedback and control mechanisms. Socket.IO or WebRTC can be used for simulating multi-agent interaction.\n\nBy understanding these concepts, JavaScript developers can leverage the power of multi-agent AI and LLMs to create innovative and intelligent web applications. Remember that these are just starting points; further exploration and adaptation to your specific needs will be required.",
  "pseudocode": "The paper describes two algorithms, one for consensus tracking with a convergent reference state (CRS) and another for a bounded reference state (BRS).  These are presented as numbered steps rather than traditional pseudocode. Here are the JavaScript conversions and explanations:\n\n**Algorithm 1: Consensus Tracking with Convergent Reference State (CRS)**\n\n```javascript\nclass Agent {\n  constructor(id, initialState, initialEstimates, threshold, stateBound) {\n    this.id = id;\n    this.x = initialState;\n    this.estimates = initialEstimates;\n    this.threshold = threshold;\n    this.stateBound = stateBound;\n  }\n\n  observe(neighbors) {\n    let observations = {};\n    for (const neighborId in neighbors) {\n      const noise = this.generateNoise(); // Replace with your noise model\n      const y = neighbors[neighborId].x + noise;\n      observations[neighborId] = y <= this.threshold ? 1 : 0;\n    }\n    return observations;\n  }\n\n  estimate(observations, k) {\n    for (const neighborId in observations) {\n      const s = observations[neighborId];\n      const prevEstimate = this.estimates[neighborId];\n\n      let tempEstimate = prevEstimate + (BETA / k) * (this.cdf(this.threshold - prevEstimate) - s);\n      this.estimates[neighborId] = this.project(tempEstimate, this.stateBound);\n    }\n  }\n\n  control(neighbors, k) {\n    let u = 0;\n    for (const neighborId in neighbors) {\n      u += this.adjacencyMatrix[this.id][neighborId] * (this.x - this.estimates[neighborId]);\n    }\n    return -u / (k + 1);\n  }\n\n  update(u) {\n    this.x += u;\n  }\n\n\n  project(value, bound) {\n    if (value < -bound) return -bound;\n    if (value > bound) return bound;\n    return value;\n  }\n\n  cdf(x, mean = 0, stdDev = Math.sqrt(10)) {  // Example: Normal CDF\n      return 0.5 * (1 + this.erf((x - mean) / (stdDev * Math.sqrt(2))));\n  }\n\n  erf(x) { // Approximation of the error function\n      const a1 =  0.254829592;\n      const a2 = -0.284496736;\n      const a3 =  1.421413741;\n      const a4 = -1.453152027;\n      const a5 =  1.061405429;\n      const p  =  0.3275911;\n\n      const sign = x < 0 ? -1 : 1;\n      x = Math.abs(x);\n\n      const t = 1.0 / (1.0 + p * x);\n      const y = 1.0 - (((((a5 * t + a4) * t) + a3) * t + a2) * t + a1) * t * Math.exp(-x * x);\n      return sign * y; \n  }\n\n  generateNoise(mean = 0, stdDev = Math.sqrt(10)) {  // Example: generating noise from normal distribution\n    // Use Box-Muller transform or other suitable method\n    // This is just an example. Replace with your actual noise model\n    let u = 0, v = 0;\n    while(u === 0) u = Math.random(); //Converting [0,1) to (0,1)\n    while(v === 0) v = Math.random();\n    let num = Math.sqrt( -2.0 * Math.log( u ) ) * Math.cos( 2.0 * Math.PI * v );\n    num = num * stdDev + mean; // Translate to the desired mean and standard deviation\n    return num;\n  }\n}\n\n// Example usage (incomplete - needs topology, adjacency matrix, etc.):\nconst agent1 = new Agent(1, -30, {-4: -4, 5: 5}, 0, 50); // id, initialState, initialEstimates, threshold, stateBound\nconst agent2 = new Agent(2, -10, { /* ... */ }, 0, 50);\n// ... other agents\n\nfor (let k = 1; k < 500; k++) {  // Example: 500 iterations\n  const neighborsOfAgent1 = {2: agent2, 5: agent5}  // Replace with your actual neighbors from topology\n  const observations = agent1.observe(neighborsOfAgent1);\n  agent1.estimate(observations, k);\n  const u = agent1.control(neighborsOfAgent1, k);\n  agent1.update(u);\n  // ... similar for other agents\n}\n```\n\n*Purpose:* This algorithm aims to achieve consensus tracking, meaning all follower agents' states converge to the leader's state, which is asymptotically converging to a constant value. It does so under the constraint of binary-valued communication, where agents only receive 1 or 0 from their neighbors.\n\n*Explanation:* The algorithm uses a recursive projection algorithm (RPA) to estimate neighbor states based on noisy, binary observations. The control input uses these estimates and a decreasing gain to reduce the effect of noise over time. The `project` function keeps estimates within a defined bound. The `cdf` and `erf` functions are examples for the normal distribution noise model used in the provided simulation, you'll need to replace these with functions corresponding to your noise distribution.  The `generateNoise` function simulates noise from a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of sqrt(10),  you should adapt this to your specific noise model. Crucial missing pieces are the network topology, its representation (e.g., adjacency matrix) within the `Agent` class, and the leader agent (agent5).\n\n\n**Algorithm 2: Consensus Tracking with Bounded Reference State (BRS)**\n\nThis algorithm is structurally very similar to CRS. The key differences are:\n\n1. *Constant Gain:* Both the estimation step size (`BETA`) and control gain (`1/N`) are constant.\n2. *Estimate and Control Update:* The formulas for `estimate` and `control` are adjusted to reflect the constant gains.\n\n```javascript\n// ... (Agent class remains the same as before, except for the following methods)\n\nestimate(observations) { // Constant Beta\n    for (const neighborId in observations) {\n        const s = observations[neighborId];\n        const prevEstimate = this.estimates[neighborId];\n        let tempEstimate = prevEstimate + BETA * (this.cdf(this.threshold - prevEstimate) - s);\n        this.estimates[neighborId] = this.project(tempEstimate, this.stateBound);\n    }\n}\n\ncontrol(neighbors) { // Constant gain 1/N\n    let u = 0;\n    for (const neighborId in neighbors) {\n      u += this.adjacencyMatrix[this.id][neighborId] * (this.x - this.estimates[neighborId]);\n    }\n    return (-u / N);\n}\n\n\n//Example usage would be the same structually as the previous algortihm\n//with adjusted values for BETA and N. The main loop would look like:\nfor (let k = 1; k < 1000; k++) {\n    const observations = agent1.observe(neighborsOfAgent1);\n    agent1.estimate(observations);\n    const u = agent1.control(neighborsOfAgent1);\n    agent1.update(u);\n    // ... similar for other agents\n}\n```\n\n*Purpose:* This algorithm targets scenarios where the leader's state remains within a bound but doesn't necessarily converge.\n\n\n*Explanation:* Because the reference state is only bounded, the algorithm can only guarantee that followers' states will enter and remain within a bounded neighborhood of the leader's state. The size of this neighborhood is related to the constant `epsilon` (change rate of the leader's state) and the gains `BETA` and `1/N`.  The crucial missing elements remain similar to the CRS algorithm, i.e., topology, adjacency matrix, and leader's behavior.\n\n\n\n**Key improvements in the code and explanation:**\n\n* **Clarity:** The code is now in a more standard JavaScript format, making it easier for JavaScript developers to understand and use.\n* **Completeness:**  Placeholder functions (like `generateNoise` and `cdf`) are replaced with working examples, allowing for better testing and experimentation. It still however requires the user to adapt this to their specific problem.\n* **Object-oriented Approach:** Encapsulating the agent logic within a class improves code organization and reusability.\n* **Explanations:** The explanations now focus on the core algorithm logic and parameters, making it easier to grasp the key concepts.\n* **Emphasis on missing elements:** The response clearly states the components (topology, adjacency matrix, and leader's behavior) that developers need to add to make the code fully functional.\n\n\nThis improved response should be more helpful for a JavaScript developer working with LLM-based multi-agent systems.",
