  "title": "Distributed Multi-robot Source Seeking in Unknown Environments with Unknown Number of Sources",
  "abstract": "Abstract-We introduce a novel distributed source seeking framework, DIAS, designed for multi-robot systems in scenarios where the number of sources is unknown and potentially exceeds the number of robots. Traditional robotic source seeking methods typically focused on directing each robot to a specific strong source and may fall short in comprehensively identifying all potential sources. DIAS addresses this gap by introducing a hybrid controller that identifies the presence of sources and then alternates between exploration for data gathering and exploitation for guiding robots to identified sources. It further enhances search efficiency by dividing the environment into Voronoi cells and approximating source density functions based on Gaussian process regression. Additionally, DIAS can be integrated with existing source seeking algorithms. We compare DIAS with existing algorithms, including DoSS and GMES in simulated gas leakage scenarios where the number of sources outnumbers or is equal to the number of robots. The numerical results show that DIAS outperforms the baseline methods in both the efficiency of source identification by the robots and the accuracy of the estimated environmental density function.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces DIAS, a distributed multi-robot system for locating multiple unknown sources (e.g., gas leaks) where the number of sources may exceed the number of robots.  DIAS uses Voronoi tessellation to divide the search space, Gaussian Process Regression to model the source distribution, and a hybrid controller that balances exploration (gathering data) and exploitation (moving towards potential sources).\n\nKey points for LLM-based multi-agent systems: DIAS's hybrid control approach, balancing exploration and exploitation, is highly relevant to decision-making in multi-agent LLM applications. The use of Gaussian Processes to model an unknown environment could be adapted to represent uncertain information states within an LLM-based system. The distributed nature of DIAS, relying on local information and limited communication, aligns well with the challenges of scaling multi-agent LLM systems.  DIAS's ability to identify *all* sources, even when outnumbered, is valuable for LLM agents needing to exhaustively consider multiple options or perspectives.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents DIAS, a distributed multi-robot source seeking framework, which offers valuable insights for JavaScript developers building LLM-based multi-agent web applications. Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights:\n\n**1. Decentralized Coordination with Web Workers:**\n\n* **Concept:** DIAS emphasizes decentralized control, where each robot (agent) makes decisions based on local information and limited communication with neighbors.  This aligns well with web workers in JavaScript, allowing for parallel processing and distributed task allocation.\n* **Example:** Imagine a multi-agent application for collaborative document editing. Each user (agent) is represented by a web worker.  They can edit their local section of the document and communicate changes to neighboring web workers (representing users editing adjacent sections) to maintain consistency, mirroring the limited communication in DIAS. Libraries like `comlink` simplify communication between web workers.\n\n**2. Environment Estimation with TensorFlow.js:**\n\n* **Concept:** DIAS uses Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to estimate the environmental density function.  TensorFlow.js provides tools for implementing GPR in JavaScript.\n* **Example:**  In a multi-agent system for personalized recommendations, each agent (representing a user's browsing session) can use TensorFlow.js to build a local GPR model of the user's preferences.  This local model acts as the agent's \"environment,\" allowing it to suggest items and learn from the user's feedback without sharing the entire browsing history with a central server, mimicking the distributed nature of DIAS's environmental estimation.\n\n**3. Hybrid Control with State Machines:**\n\n* **Concept:** DIAS uses a hybrid controller that switches between exploration (active sensing) and exploitation (source seeking).  JavaScript developers can use state machine libraries like `xstate` to implement this hybrid behavior.\n* **Example:**  In a multi-agent chatbot application, each chatbot agent can be implemented as a state machine. The \"exploration\" state could involve asking clarifying questions or exploring a wider range of topics using LLMs. The \"exploitation\" state could focus on providing specific answers or completing a task based on the information gathered during exploration, mirroring DIASâ€™s hybrid control strategy.\n\n**4. Voronoi Tessellation with Turf.js or similar:**\n\n* **Concept:** DIAS uses Voronoi tessellation for efficient task allocation among agents. JavaScript libraries like Turf.js provide functions for calculating Voronoi diagrams.\n* **Example:** A multi-agent system for managing a fleet of delivery drones. Each drone (agent) is assigned a Voronoi cell representing its delivery zone.  Turf.js can be used to dynamically update the Voronoi cells based on the drones' locations, ensuring efficient coverage and minimizing overlap, mirroring the dynamic task allocation in DIAS.\n\n**5. Source Identification with Proximity Calculations:**\n\n* **Concept:** DIAS defines source identification based on proximity. This translates easily to JavaScript by calculating distances between agents and points of interest.\n* **Example:**  In a multi-agent game, agents could be tasked with finding hidden treasures (sources). When an agent is within a certain distance of a treasure, it's considered \"found,\" echoing the source identification mechanism in DIAS. Libraries like `geolib` can be used for distance calculations.\n\n**6. Experimenting with LangChain and LLMs:**\n\n* **Concept:** DIAS is about efficient information gathering.  LangChain provides a framework for developing LLM-based applications that can be integrated with the multi-agent concepts discussed above.\n* **Example:** Each agent in the delivery drone example could use an LLM powered by LangChain to optimize its route within its Voronoi cell, considering factors like traffic, weather, and delivery priorities. This combines the distributed nature of DIAS with the power of LLMs for complex problem-solving.\n\n\nBy applying these techniques, JavaScript developers can build robust, scalable, and efficient LLM-based multi-agent web applications inspired by the principles of DIAS.  The combination of distributed control, efficient environment estimation, and hybrid behavior allows for sophisticated applications in areas like collaborative editing, personalized recommendations, automated customer service, and much more.",

Its goal is to have the robots efficiently and cooperatively find all sources. It addresses limitations of traditional methods that focus on only the strongest source or a limited number of sources.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key components:\n\n1. **Environment Estimation:** DIAS partitions the environment into Voronoi cells, one per robot.  This assigns each robot a region of responsibility, reducing redundant exploration. It uses Gaussian Process Regression (GP) to model the unknown density function of the sources based on collected sensor measurements.\n\n\n2. **Hybrid Controller:** This is the core of DIAS. It decides whether a robot should exploit (go to a potential source) or explore (gather more information).  It uses a Lower Confidence Bound (LCB) criterion to identify potential source locations within a robot's Voronoi cell. If a potential source is identified, the robot switches to source seeking. Otherwise, it performs active sensing.\n\n\n3. **Source Seeking:**  If a potential source is identified, the robot navigates towards it using Model Predictive Control (MPC), which allows for more sophisticated path planning considering robot dynamics and constraints.\n\n4. **Active Sensing:** When no promising sources are identified, the robot explores using ergodic control. This technique guides the robot to gather information in regions where the expected information gain is high based on the EID function.  It uses mutual information (or a lower bound) as the information criterion.  The multi-robot version of ergodic control uses consensus to ensure the robots' overall exploration is coordinated.\n\n5. **Source Identification and Sharing:** Once a robot is close enough to a source, it marks the source as found and shares this information with its neighbors, preventing redundant searches.\n\n\nBy combining these components, DIAS provides a robust and efficient framework for multi-robot source seeking in challenging, unknown environments. This is especially relevant in scenarios where the number of sources might be greater than the number of robots.  The integration with existing source-seeking algorithms within the framework showcases its flexibility and potential to enhance existing methods.",
