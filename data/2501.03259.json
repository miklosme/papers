  "title": "Toward Inclusive Educational AI: Auditing Frontier LLMs through a Multiplexity Lens",
  "abstract": "Abstract-As large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and Llama 3 become integral to educational contexts, concerns are mounting over the cultural biases, power imbalances, and ethical limitations embedded within these technologies. Though generative AI tools aim to enhance learning experiences, they often reflect values rooted in Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) cultural paradigms, potentially sidelining diverse global perspectives. This paper proposes a framework to assess and mitigate cultural bias within LLMs through the lens of applied multiplexity. Multiplexity, inspired by Senturk et al. and rooted in Islamic and other wisdom traditions, emphasizes the coexistence of diverse cultural viewpoints, supporting a multi-layered epistemology that integrates both empirical sciences and normative values. Our analysis reveals that LLMs frequently exhibit cultural polarization, with biases appearing in both overt responses and subtle contextual cues. To address inherent biases and incorporate multiplexity in LLMs, we propose two strategies: Contextually-Implemented Multiplex LLMs, which embed multiplex principles directly into the system prompt, influencing LLM outputs at a foundational level and independent of individual prompts, and Multi-Agent System (MAS)-Implemented Multiplex LLMs, where multiple LLM agents, each representing distinct cultural viewpoints, collaboratively generate a balanced, synthesized response. Our findings demonstrate that as mitigation strategies evolve from contextual prompting to MAS-implementation, cultural inclusivity markedly improves, evidenced by a significant rise in the Perspectives Distribution Score (PDS) and a PDS Entropy increase from 3.25% at baseline to 98% with the MAS-Implemented Multiplex LLMs. Sentiment analysis further shows a shift towards positive sentiment across cultures, with the MAS-Implemented Multiplex LLMs achieving 0% negative sentiment, underscoring enhanced cultural sensitivity. This pioneering study establishes a baseline for assessing and fostering cultural inclusivity in educational AI, laying the groundwork for a globally pluralistic approach that respects diverse cultural perspectives. We hope this work inspires further research toward creating AI technologies that serve a truly inclusive and multicultural educational ecosystem.",
  "summary": "This paper explores how to make large language models (LLMs) used in education less biased towards certain cultures (primarily Western). It introduces a framework called \"Multiplexity\" to measure and mitigate this bias, focusing on representing diverse cultural viewpoints.  A key point for LLM-based multi-agent systems is the introduction of a multi-agent approach where individual agents, each representing a specific culture, contribute to a final response synthesized by a central \"Multiplex Agent\".  This approach, implemented using the Camel AI framework, proved highly effective in creating more culturally inclusive and balanced LLM outputs for educational purposes.",
  "takeaways": "This research paper presents a fascinating approach to mitigating cultural bias in LLMs, particularly relevant for multi-agent applications in web development. Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights:\n\n**1. Baseline Assessment and Bias Detection:**\n\n* **Data Collection:**  Log user interactions with your LLM-powered agents, capturing prompts and responses.  Store this data in a format suitable for analysis (e.g., JSON).  Ensure you anonymize user data to protect privacy.\n* **Perspective Extractor Implementation:**  Build a JavaScript function leveraging a powerful LLM API (like OpenAI's) to extract cultural references from text. The paper uses a dictionary format; you could similarly structure the output in JavaScript using objects:\n\n```javascript\nasync function extractPerspectives(text, cultures) {\n  const prompt = `Extract references to the following cultures from this text:\\n${cultures.join(', ')}\\n\\nText:\\n${text}\\n\\nOutput as a JavaScript object where keys are cultures and values are arrays of extracted references:`;\n  const response = await openai.createCompletion({\n    model: \"gpt-4\", // Or a suitable model\n    prompt,\n    temperature: 0, // For consistent output\n  });\n  try {\n    return JSON.parse(response.data.choices[0].text.trim());\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(\"Error parsing JSON:\", error);\n    return null;\n  }\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nconst cultures = [\"Western\", \"Eastern\", \"Islamic\", ...];\nconst references = await extractPerspectives(agentResponse, cultures);\nconsole.log(references); // { Western: [\"democracy\", \"individualism\"], Eastern: [\"harmony\", ...], ... }\n```\n\n* **PDS and Entropy Calculation:**  Implement the PDS and entropy calculations in JavaScript based on the formulas provided in the paper. This will quantify the cultural representation balance. Use libraries like `mathjs` for efficient calculations.\n\n**2. Implementing Multiplexity in JavaScript Agents:**\n\n* **Contextual Prompt Engineering:** Modify the prompts you send to your LLM agents to include the multiplexity principles.  For instance, instruct the agent to \"consider diverse cultural viewpoints and ethical frameworks\" when generating responses.\n\n```javascript\nconst multiplexPrompt = `You are a helpful and unbiased assistant. Consider diverse cultural viewpoints and ethical frameworks when answering the following question:\\n${userQuestion}`;\n```\n\n* **Multi-Agent System with Langchain (or similar):** Build a multi-agent system using a framework like Langchain. Create individual agents, each with a specific cultural persona (as in Box 2 of the paper). Assign tasks based on agent specializations using a dispatcher agent.  Then, a \"Multiplex Agent\" can synthesize responses based on the multiplexity framework, mediating and combining the output of the specialized agents. Langchain's callbacks can be used to monitor each agent's performance and make adjustments dynamically.\n\n**3. Sentiment Analysis and Bias Framing:**\n\n* **Sentiment Analyzer Implementation:** Use an LLM or a dedicated sentiment analysis API (e.g., through libraries like `sentiment`) to evaluate the sentiment of agent responses toward different cultures. This can reveal implicit biases even in seemingly neutral responses.\n\n**Web Development Scenarios:**\n\n* **Multilingual Chatbot:**  Build a chatbot for customer support that responds appropriately in different languages and cultural contexts, ensuring respectful and culturally sensitive interactions.\n* **Educational Platforms:** Develop interactive learning environments where agents provide tailored explanations and feedback while respecting the cultural background of each student.\n* **Collaborative Design Tools:** Create multi-agent systems that assist users in collaborative design tasks, ensuring that the contributions of individuals from different cultural backgrounds are valued and integrated effectively.\n\n**Key JavaScript Libraries and Frameworks:**\n\n* **Langchain:**  For orchestrating multi-agent interactions and managing prompts.\n* **OpenAI's JavaScript Library:**  For interacting with powerful LLMs.\n* **Sentiment Analysis Libraries:**  For analyzing the sentiment of agent responses.\n* **Frontend Frameworks (React, Vue, Angular):**  For building interactive user interfaces for multi-agent applications.\n* **Node.js and Express:**  For server-side logic and API development.\n\n\nBy implementing these practical steps, JavaScript developers can build LLM-powered multi-agent systems that are more inclusive, ethical, and culturally aware. This approach can significantly enhance the user experience, particularly in diverse global settings. Remember to continuously monitor, evaluate, and refine your systems to minimize biases and promote fairness.  This paper provides a valuable foundation for building more responsible and inclusive AI applications.",
