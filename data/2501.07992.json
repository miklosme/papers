  "title": "LLM-Enhanced Holonic Architecture for Self-Adaptive System of Systems",
  "abstract": "Abstract. As modern system of systems (SoS) become increasingly adaptive and human-centred, traditional architectures often struggle to support interoperability, reconfigurability, and effective human-system interaction. This paper addresses these challenges by advancing the state-of-the-art holonic architecture for SoS, offering two main contributions to support these adaptive needs. First, we propose a layered architecture for holons, which includes reasoning, communication, and capabilities layers. This design facilitates seamless interoperability among heterogeneous constituent systems by improving data exchange and integration. Second, inspired by principles of intelligent manufacturing, we introduce specialised holons—namely, supervisor, planner, task, and resource holons—aimed at enhancing the adaptability and reconfigurability of SoS. These specialised holons utilise large language models within their reasoning layers to support decision-making and ensure real-time adaptability. We demonstrate our approach through a 3D mobility case study focused on smart city transportation, showcasing its potential for managing complex, multimodal SoS environments. Additionally, we propose evaluation methods to assess the architecture's efficiency and scalability, laying the groundwork for future empirical validations through simulations and real-world implementations.",
  "summary": "This paper proposes an enhanced holonic architecture for Systems of Systems (SoS), using Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve adaptability and human interaction.  It introduces a layered structure for individual holons (representing constituent systems) comprising reasoning (LLM-based), communication, and capability layers.  Furthermore, it introduces specialized holons (supervisor, planner, task, and resource) inspired by intelligent manufacturing to enhance SoS management. The architecture is demonstrated through a 3D mobility case study involving coordinating air and ground transportation in a smart city.  Key LLM aspects include natural language interfaces for human interaction, context-aware decision-making within holons, dynamic task planning, and real-time adaptation to changing conditions.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents a compelling vision for LLM-enhanced holonic architectures in SoS, and a skilled JavaScript developer can translate these concepts into practical web applications. Here's how:\n\n**1. Building Specialized Holons with LLMs:**\n\n* **Reasoning Layer (LLM Integration):**  Use a JavaScript LLM library like `LangChain.js` or directly integrate with cloud-based LLM APIs (OpenAI, Cohere, etc.) within your holon's logic.  Each specialized holon (Supervisor, Planner, Task, Resource) would have its own LLM prompt templates and contextual information, implemented as JavaScript functions.  Example: A \"Task Holon\" for a project management app might use an LLM to generate sub-tasks from a user-provided project description.  \n* **Communication Layer (ROS-like messaging):**  Implement a message broker using libraries like `Socket.IO` or a message queue like `Redis` to facilitate real-time communication between holons. Each holon would be a JavaScript module, subscribing and publishing messages on relevant topics. Example: A \"Resource Holon\" might publish its availability status, and a \"Task Holon\" would subscribe to this status to assign tasks.\n* **Capabilities Layer (Abstraction):** Encapsulate the underlying functionality of each holon as JavaScript classes or modules. This layer interacts with external services, databases, or APIs relevant to the holon's role. Example: A \"Machine Resource Holon\" representing a drone might have a capability layer that interacts with a drone control API.\n\n**2. Example Web Application Scenarios:**\n\n* **Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs):**  Model DAO governance as a holonic system.  \"Supervisor Holons\" could manage proposals, \"Planner Holons\" could assess feasibility, \"Task Holons\" could execute approved actions, and \"Resource Holons\" could represent DAO members and their voting power.  A JavaScript frontend framework like React or Vue could be used to build the user interface.\n* **Collaborative Project Management:**  Imagine a project management app where tasks are autonomously assigned and re-assigned based on team members' availability and skills. Specialized holons can manage task allocation, progress tracking, and resource management, all powered by LLMs.\n* **Smart Home Automation:**  Model smart home devices as \"Resource Holons,\" with \"Task Holons\" managing automation routines based on user preferences and sensor data.  LLMs could interpret natural language commands from users, such as \"Set the living room temperature to 70 degrees.\"  A web dashboard built with JavaScript could provide control and monitoring.\n\n**3. JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries:**\n\n* **Frontend:** React, Vue, Angular for building interactive user interfaces to manage and interact with the holonic system.\n* **Backend:** Node.js with Express for handling API requests and communication between holons.\n* **LLM Integration:** LangChain.js, OpenAI's JavaScript library, Cohere's JavaScript SDK.\n* **Messaging:** Socket.IO, Redis, MQTT.\n* **Visualization:** D3.js, Chart.js for displaying system status and performance metrics.\n\n**4. Experimentation and Prototyping:**\n\nStart with a simple proof of concept, focusing on a specific use case and a small number of holons.  Use mock data and simulated environments to test the interaction and reasoning capabilities of the holons.  Gradually increase the complexity and number of holons as the system evolves.\n\n**Key Takeaways for JavaScript Developers:**\n\n* This research empowers JavaScript developers to move beyond basic LLM integration and create more sophisticated, autonomous multi-agent systems.\n* The holonic architecture provides a robust and scalable framework for managing complex interactions within web applications.\n* By combining the power of LLMs with specialized holons, developers can create intelligent systems that adapt to dynamic environments and user needs.\n\n\nBy grasping these concepts, JavaScript developers can be at the forefront of creating truly intelligent and adaptive web applications using the power of LLMs and multi-agent systems.",
