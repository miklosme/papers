  "title": "Beyond Black-Box Benchmarking: Observability, Analytics, and Optimization of Agentic Systems",
  "abstract": "The rise of agentic AI systems, where agents collaborate to perform diverse tasks, poses new challenges with observing, analyzing and optimizing their behavior. Traditional evaluation and benchmarking approaches struggle to handle the non-deterministic, context-sensitive, and dynamic nature of these systems. This paper explores key challenges and opportunities in analyzing and optimizing agentic systems across development, testing, and maintenance. We explore critical issues such as natural language variability and unpredictable execution flows, which hinder predictability and control, demanding adaptive strategies to manage input variability and evolving behaviors. Through our user study, we supported these hypotheses. In particular, we showed a 79% agreement that non-deterministic flow of agentic systems acts as a major challenge. Finally, we validated our statements empirically advocating the need for moving beyond classical benchmarking. To bridge these gaps, we introduce taxonomies to present expected analytics outcomes and the ways to collect them by extending standard observability frameworks. Building on these foundations, we introduce and demonstrate a novel approach for benchmarking of agent evaluation systems. Unlike traditional \"black box\" performance evaluation approaches, our benchmark is built from agent runtime logs as input, and analytics outcome including discovered flows and issues. By addressing key limitations in existing methodologies, we aim to set the stage for more advanced and holistic evaluation strategies, which could foster the development of adaptive, interpretable, and robust agentic AI systems.",
  "summary": "This paper addresses the challenges of evaluating and optimizing the behavior of multi-agent AI systems, particularly those using Large Language Models (LLMs).  Traditional \"black box\" benchmarking is insufficient due to the non-deterministic nature of these systems.\n\nKey points for LLM-based multi-agent systems:\n\n* **Variability:** Both execution flow and the natural language used in prompts and responses introduce variability and make behavior unpredictable.\n* **Behavioral Benchmarking:** The authors propose shifting from outcome-based metrics to analyzing actual agent behavior, including interactions and decision-making processes.\n* **Observability and Analytics:** A new taxonomy and framework are introduced to improve the observability and analysis of multi-agent systems, focusing on capturing non-deterministic elements.\n* **ABBench:** A novel benchmark dataset is introduced to evaluate agent analytic technologies, enabling developers to compare their analytical tools and methods against ground truth data and assess effectiveness in capturing behavioral nuances of agentic systems.\n* **Optimization Patterns:** Optimization strategies like task decomposition, parallel execution, and task merging are presented to help balance quality, performance, and cost in agentic systems.\n* **User Study:** A study of practitioners validated the challenges and highlights the need for improved tools and methods for understanding, debugging, and optimizing agentic system behavior.",
  "takeaways": "This paper emphasizes observability, analytics, and optimization of LLM-based multi-agent systems, crucial for robust web applications. Here's how JavaScript developers can apply these insights:\n\n**1. Enhanced Observability with OpenTelemetry and Custom Instrumentation:**\n\n* **Scenario:** A multi-agent e-commerce app where agents handle product recommendations, inventory checks, and customer service.\n* **Implementation:** Integrate OpenTelemetry (OTel) libraries for JavaScript to collect traces, logs, and metrics. Instrument custom events for crucial agent actions (e.g., \"product_recommended,\" \"inventory_checked,\" \"conversation_started\") using OTel's semantic conventions. This allows tracing the entire flow of a user interacting with multiple agents.\n* **Example:**\n\n```javascript\nimport { trace } from '@opentelemetry/api';\n\nconst tracer = trace.getTracer('e-commerce-app');\n\nasync function recommendProduct(userId, productId) {\n  return tracer.startActiveSpan('recommend_product', async (span) => {\n    try {\n      // Logic for product recommendation\n      span.addEvent('product_recommended', { userId, productId });\n      return recommendation;\n    } catch (error) {\n      span.setStatus({ code: SpanStatusCode.ERROR, message: error.message });\n      throw error;\n    } finally {\n      span.end();\n    }\n  });\n}\n```\n\n**2. Implementing Task Flow Analysis with LangGraph or Custom Graph Libraries:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  A collaborative document editing application where multiple agents assist users with writing, grammar, and style.\n* **Implementation:** Use LangGraph (if available in JavaScript) or a JavaScript graph library like `vis-network` or `cytoscape.js` to visualize the agent interaction graph.  Represent each agent action as a node and dependencies as edges. Analyze this graph to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies in task execution.\n* **Example (Conceptual - LangGraph is Python-based):**\n\n```javascript\n// Conceptual example using a hypothetical JavaScript LangGraph API\nconst graph = new LangGraph();\n\ngraph.addNode('grammar_check', { agent: 'grammarAgent' });\ngraph.addNode('style_suggestion', { agent: 'styleAgent' });\ngraph.addEdge('grammar_check', 'style_suggestion');\n\n// Visualize and analyze the graph\ngraph.visualize();\nconst bottlenecks = graph.findBottlenecks();\n```\n\n\n**3. Agent Analytics Dashboard with a JavaScript Visualization Library:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  A multi-agent system for managing smart home devices.\n* **Implementation:**  Use a JavaScript visualization library like D3.js, Chart.js, or a component library like React or Vue to create a dashboard displaying agent performance metrics (e.g., latency, cost, error rates). This can also visualize task flows, identify bottlenecks, and visualize variability across different executions.\n* **Example (Conceptual):**\n\n```javascript\n// Fetch agent analytics data from your backend\nfetch('/agent_analytics')\n  .then(response => response.json())\n  .then(data => {\n    // Use Chart.js to create charts\n    new Chart(\"latencyChart\", {\n      type: \"line\",\n      data: {\n        labels: data.timestamps,\n        datasets: [{\n          label: \"Agent Latency\",\n          data: data.latency,\n        }]\n      }\n    });\n\n    // Use vis-network or cytoscape to create a task flow visualization.\n  });\n```\n\n**4. Addressing Non-Determinism in Agent Behavior:**\n\n* **Scenario:** A chatbot application powered by LLMs where responses can vary.\n* **Implementation:** Use techniques like prompt engineering to minimize variability.  This includes providing more context, explicit instructions, and examples in the prompts.  Monitor variability using metrics like response similarity and edit distance.\n* **Example (Conceptual):**\n\n```javascript\n// Improve prompt with clear instructions\nconst initialPrompt = \"Write a poem about nature\";\nconst improvedPrompt = `Write a short poem about nature, focusing on trees and flowers.  \nExample:\nThe oak tree stands so tall and strong,\nIts branches reaching for the sky.\nBelow, the flowers bloom so bright,\nA vibrant tapestry of color and light.`;\n\n\n// Measure variability using edit distance (Levenshtein distance)\nconst response1 = await llm.generate(improvedPrompt);\nconst response2 = await llm.generate(improvedPrompt);\nconst distance = levenshtein(response1, response2); // Use a Levenshtein library\n```\n\nThese practical examples bridge the theoretical concepts from the paper to concrete JavaScript development scenarios.  The key takeaway is to integrate observability, task flow analysis, and analytics dashboards into your LLM-based multi-agent applications, enabling you to understand, debug, and optimize their behavior effectively. This is essential for creating robust and reliable multi-agent web applications.",
