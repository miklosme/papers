  "title": "Merit-Based Sortition in Decentralized Systems",
  "abstract": "In decentralized systems, it is often necessary to select an 'active' subset of participants from the total participant pool, with the goal of satisfying computational limitations or optimizing resource efficiency. This selection can sometimes be made at random, mirroring the sortition practice invented in classical antiquity aimed at achieving a high degree of statistical representativeness. However, the recent emergence of specialized decentralized networks that solve concrete coordination problems and are characterized by measurable success metrics often requires prioritizing performance optimization over representativeness. We introduce a simple algorithm for 'merit-based sortition', in which the quality of each participant influences its probability of being drafted into the active set, while simultaneously retaining representativeness by allowing inactive participants an infinite number of chances to be drafted into the active set with non-zero probability. Using a suite of numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our algorithm boosts the quality metric describing the performance of the active set by > 2 times the intrinsic stochasticity. This implies that merit-based sortition ensures a statistically significant performance boost to the drafted, 'active' set, while retaining the property of classical, random sortition that it enables upward mobility from a much larger 'inactive' set. This way, merit-based sortition fulfils a key requirement for decentralized systems in need of performance optimization.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces \"merit-based sortition,\" a method for selecting a smaller \"active\" group from a larger pool of participants in a decentralized system based on their performance (merit).  It aims to improve efficiency by limiting active participation while maintaining representativeness and boosting overall performance.  The method uses an exponential moving average (EMA) of a quality metric to smooth out performance fluctuations and a percentile-based system to manage the flow between active and inactive participants.\n\nKey points for LLM-based multi-agent systems:\n\n* **Dynamic Agent Selection:**  Merit-based sortition can be applied to select the most performant LLMs for specific tasks at any given time, dynamically optimizing the system's overall intelligence.\n* **Robustness and Adaptability:** The EMA smoothing and percentile system allows the multi-agent system to adapt to changes in individual LLM performance over time.\n* **Scalability and Efficiency:** This method is designed for large decentralized networks and addresses computational limitations by limiting active LLM participation without sacrificing overall performance.\n* **Fairness and Representation:**  While prioritizing performance, the system maintains a degree of fairness by giving all LLMs a chance to become active based on improved performance.  This is especially relevant in scenarios where diverse perspectives are valued.\n* **Tunable Performance:** The percentile parameter (P) allows developers to fine-tune the balance between performance optimization and participation churn. This allows customization for various applications and LLM capabilities.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents a \"merit-based sortition\" algorithm for selecting an active subset of agents from a larger pool, optimizing for performance while maintaining a degree of fairness.  Here are some practical examples for JavaScript developers working with LLM-based multi-agent AI in web development:\n\n**1. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) with LLM Agents:**\n\n* **Scenario:** A DAO uses LLM agents for tasks like proposal evaluation, community moderation, and content creation.  There are many agents, but only a limited number can actively participate in each task due to resource constraints.\n* **Application:** Implement merit-based sortition to select the active agents.  The quality metric (`Qij`) could be based on past performance, like accuracy of proposal evaluations or positive feedback on moderation actions.  Use a library like TensorFlow.js or a custom implementation for the EMA calculation and agent selection logic.\n* **Example Code Snippet (Conceptual):**\n```javascript\n// Agent object\nclass Agent {\n  constructor(id, model) { /* ... */ }\n  async performTask(task) { /* ... use LLM to perform task */ }\n}\n\n// Merit-based selection function\nfunction selectActiveAgents(agents, task, percentile) {\n  const activeAgents = [];\n  // ... calculate EMA-based quality scores (Qij)\n  // ... sort agents based on Qij\n  // ... select top Nact based on percentile (P)\n  return activeAgents;\n}\n\n// Example usage\nconst activeModerators = selectActiveAgents(allModerators, 'moderateForum', 20);\nactiveModerators.forEach(agent => agent.performTask('moderateForum'));\n```\n\n**2. Collaborative LLM-powered Content Creation:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  A web application allows multiple users to collaboratively write a story using LLM agents as assistants.  Each agent suggests plot points, dialogue, and character development, but the interface can only display suggestions from a few active agents at a time.\n* **Application:** Use merit-based sortition to dynamically prioritize agent suggestions. The quality metric could be based on user feedback (upvotes, downvotes) on previous suggestions.  React or Vue.js could be used to manage the dynamic display of agent suggestions.\n* **Benefit:** This ensures that higher-quality suggestions are more likely to be presented, improving the collaborative writing experience.\n\n**3. Multi-Agent Simulation and Modeling in the Browser:**\n\n* **Scenario:** A web application simulates a market with LLM agents acting as traders.  Each agent has different trading strategies and risk tolerances. The simulation needs to manage computational resources efficiently.\n* **Application:** Implement merit-based sortition to select active traders for each simulation step.  The quality metric could be the agent's profit or portfolio value.  Libraries like D3.js could visualize the simulation results.\n\n**4. Dynamic Resource Allocation in Serverless Functions:**\n\n* **Scenario:** A serverless function hosts multiple LLM agents that respond to user queries.  Resource allocation needs to be optimized based on agent performance.\n* **Application:** Use merit-based sortition to allocate resources (e.g., memory, execution time) to the most performant agents. The quality metric could be the average response time or accuracy of the agent's responses.\n\n**Key JavaScript Considerations:**\n\n* **EMA Calculation:** Implement the EMA calculation efficiently in JavaScript. Consider using libraries like TensorFlow.js for optimized numerical computations.\n* **Agent Communication:** Design a robust communication mechanism between agents, especially if they need to share information about their performance or the current task. Consider using WebSockets or server-sent events for real-time updates.\n* **UI Integration:** Integrate the agent selection and task allocation logic seamlessly into the web application's UI.  Use a framework like React, Vue.js, or Angular to manage dynamic updates.\n\n**Further Experimentation:**\n\n* Explore different quality metrics and percentile values to find the optimal configuration for your specific application.\n* Implement visualizations to monitor agent performance and the effectiveness of the merit-based sortition algorithm.\n* Investigate how to adapt the algorithm for different LLM architectures and task types.\n\nBy applying these practical examples and considerations, JavaScript developers can leverage the power of merit-based sortition to build more efficient and engaging LLM-powered multi-agent web applications. Remember to adapt the concepts presented in the paper to your specific needs and context.  This area is ripe for innovation, so don't be afraid to experiment and push the boundaries of what's possible.",
  "pseudocode": "The paper describes an algorithm for merit-based sortition but doesn't provide it in a formal pseudocode block. However, the description is detailed enough to be translated into JavaScript.  Here's an implementation along with explanations:\n\n```javascript\nclass MeritBasedSortition {\n  constructor(Ntot, Nact, percentile, alpha = 0.1, penaltyFactor = 2) {\n    this.Ntot = Ntot; // Total number of participants\n    this.Nact = Nact; // Number of active participants\n    this.percentile = percentile; // Percentile for inactive participant updates\n    this.alpha = alpha;  // Smoothing factor for EMA\n    this.penaltyFactor = penaltyFactor;\n    this.participants = Array(this.Ntot).fill(null).map(() => ({\n      medianQuality: this.gaussianRandom(0.2, 0.1), // Initialize median quality\n      emaQuality: null, // Initialize EMA quality\n      active: false      // Initialize activity status\n    }));\n  }\n\n  gaussianRandom(mean, stdDev) { // Helper function for Gaussian random numbers\n    let u = 0, v = 0;\n    while(u === 0) u = Math.random(); //Converting [0,1) to (0,1)\n    while(v === 0) v = Math.random();\n    let num = Math.sqrt( -2.0 * Math.log( u ) ) * Math.cos( 2.0 * Math.PI * v );\n    num = num * stdDev + mean;\n    return num;\n  }\n\n  percentileOf(arr, p) { // Helper function for percentile calculation\n    if (arr.length === 0) return 0;\n    const sorted = arr.slice().sort((a, b) => a - b);\n    const index = (p / 100) * (sorted.length - 1);\n    const lower = Math.floor(index);\n    const upper = Math.ceil(index);\n    return sorted[lower] + (upper - lower) * (sorted[upper] - sorted[lower]);\n  }\n\n  runEpoch() {\n    const instantaneousQualities = [];\n    const activeQualities = [];\n\n    // Calculate instantaneous qualities and update EMAs for active participants\n    for (let j = 0; j < this.Ntot; j++) {\n      const instQuality = this.gaussianRandom(this.participants[j].medianQuality, 0.2);\n      instantaneousQualities.push(instQuality);\n      if (this.participants[j].active) {\n        activeQualities.push(instQuality);\n        this.participants[j].emaQuality = this.alpha * instQuality + (1 - this.alpha) * this.participants[j].emaQuality;\n      }\n    }\n\n    const percentileQuality = this.percentileOf(activeQualities, this.percentile);\n\n    // Update EMAs for inactive participants using percentile\n    for (let j = 0; j < this.Ntot; j++) {\n      if (!this.participants[j].active) {\n        this.participants[j].emaQuality = this.alpha * percentileQuality + (1 - this.alpha) * this.participants[j].emaQuality;\n      }\n    }\n\n    // Select the top Nact participants based on EMA quality\n    this.participants.sort((a, b) => b.emaQuality - a.emaQuality);\n    for (let j = 0; j < this.Ntot; j++) {\n      this.participants[j].active = j < this.Nact;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n// Example usage:\nconst sortition = new MeritBasedSortition(80, 50, 20);\nfor (let i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {\n  sortition.runEpoch();\n  // Access active participants after each epoch if needed\n  // console.log(sortition.participants.filter(p => p.active));\n}\n\n```\n\n**Explanation and Purpose:**\n\nThis JavaScript code implements the merit-based sortition algorithm.  The core logic resides in the `runEpoch` function, which simulates a single epoch of the system.  Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. **Calculate Instantaneous Qualities:**  It calculates instantaneous quality (`instQuality`) for each participant, drawing from a normal distribution based on their individual median quality and a volatility parameter.\n2. **Update Active Participant EMAs:**  It updates the EMA quality of *active* participants using their instantaneous quality.\n3. **Calculate Percentile Quality:**  It calculates the `percentile`-th percentile of the instantaneous qualities of the *active* participants. This value is crucial for updating the EMAs of the inactive participants.\n4. **Update Inactive Participant EMAs:** It updates the EMA quality of *inactive* participants using the calculated `percentileQuality`.  This ensures they have a chance to become active in the future.\n5. **Select Active Participants:** Sorts all participants based on their updated EMA qualities and sets the top `Nact` participants to active and the rest to inactive.\n\n\nThis implementation aims to create a more performant subset of \"active\" participants by favoring those with higher quality scores while maintaining permeability so less active participants can rise in rank. The code uses helper functions for Gaussian random number generation and percentile calculations. The `MeritBasedSortition` class encapsulates the entire algorithm, allowing for easy configuration and execution of multiple epochs. This code allows JavaScript developers to experiment with the concept of Merit-Based Sortition within their projects, especially in multi-agent system development where agents can be dynamically chosen based on performance metrics.",
