  "title": "Zero-determinant strategies in repeated continuously-relaxed games",
  "abstract": "Mixed extension has played an important role in game theory, especially in the proof of the existence of Nash equilibria in strategic form games. Mixed extension can be regarded as continuous relaxation of a strategic form game. Recently, in repeated games, a class of behavior strategies, called zero-determinant strategies, was introduced. Zero-determinant strategies unilaterally enforce linear relations between payoffs, and are used to control payoffs of players. There are many attempts to extend zero-determinant strategies so as to apply them to broader situations. Here, we extend zero-determinant strategies to repeated games where action sets of players in stage game are continuously relaxed. We see that continuous relaxation broadens the range of possible zero-determinant strategies, compared to the original repeated games. Furthermore, we introduce a special type of zero-determinant strategies, called one-point zero-determinant strategies, which repeat only one continuously-relaxed action in all rounds. By investigating several examples, we show that some property of mixed-strategy Nash equilibria can be reinterpreted as a payoff-control property of one-point zero-determinant strategies.",
  "summary": "This paper explores \"zero-determinant\" (ZD) strategies within repeated games where players' actions are probabilistic (mixed strategies).  ZD strategies allow a player to unilaterally enforce a specific linear relationship between their own and other players' payoffs. The research extends ZD strategies to scenarios where action choices are continuous rather than discrete, finding that this \"continuous relaxation\" makes more ZD strategies possible.  A special case, \"one-point\" ZD strategies, where a player repeats a single mixed strategy, is shown to connect to properties of Nash equilibria in classic game theory examples like Matching Pennies and the Battle of the Sexes.\n\nFor LLM-based multi-agent systems, this research suggests ways to design agents that can control payoff relationships in complex, dynamic interactions.  The continuous relaxation of action spaces may be relevant to LLMs outputting probability distributions over possible actions.  One-point ZD strategies could offer a simple yet effective mechanism for an LLM-agent to influence the overall outcome of a multi-agent interaction by strategically choosing a single mixed strategy distribution.",
  "takeaways": "This paper explores Zero-Determinant (ZD) strategies within the context of repeated games with continuous action spaces, relevant to multi-agent systems where agents can take actions on a continuous spectrum (e.g., allocating resources, setting prices, or controlling physical actuators).  Let's translate these insights into practical JavaScript applications for LLM-based multi-agent web development:\n\n**1. Continuous Action Spaces in Web Applications:**\n\nImagine a multi-agent system for decentralized e-commerce, where LLM-powered agents negotiate prices. Instead of discrete price points, agents can propose prices within a continuous range.  Here’s how a JavaScript developer can implement this using a library like TensorFlow.js:\n\n```javascript\n// Define price range\nconst minPrice = 10;\nconst maxPrice = 100;\n\n// Agent's action space (continuous)\nconst agentAction = tf.variable(tf.randomUniform([1], minPrice, maxPrice)); \n\n// Example using TensorFlow.js for optimization (finding optimal price)\ntf.train.adam().minimize(() => { \n  // Loss function (e.g., based on opponent's actions and market conditions)\n  const loss = calculateLoss(agentAction, opponentActions, marketData); \n  return loss;\n});\n```\n\n**2. Implementing Two-Point ZD Strategies:**\n\nThe paper describes two-point ZD strategies where an agent chooses between two continuous actions (p₁, p₂) based on the opponent's history. In our e-commerce example, an agent could have two base prices (p₁, p₂) and switch between them based on competitors' pricing strategies.\n\n```javascript\n// Two base prices (actions p₁ and p₂)\nconst price1 = tf.tensor(75); \nconst price2 = tf.tensor(50);\n\n// Function to determine which price to use based on opponent's history\nfunction choosePrice(opponentHistory) {\n  const opponentAveragePrice = calculateAveragePrice(opponentHistory);\n  if (opponentAveragePrice > 60) {\n    return price1;  // Higher price if opponent is pricing high\n  } else {\n    return price2; // Lower price to undercut\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**3. One-Point ZD Strategies and Nash Equilibria:**\n\nOne-point ZD strategies, where an agent repeats a single continuous action, can relate to Nash equilibria. In a resource-allocation scenario, if an agent consistently chooses a specific resource allocation level regardless of other agents' actions and achieves a stable outcome, it might indicate a Nash equilibrium.\n\n```javascript\n// Constant resource allocation (one-point ZD strategy)\nconst resourceAllocation = tf.tensor(0.5); // Allocate 50% of resources\n\n// Monitor other agents' actions and outcomes, \n// if stable over time, this allocation could be a Nash Equilibrium\nmonitorSystem(resourceAllocation, otherAgentActions).then(isStable => {\n  if (isStable) { console.log(\"Potential Nash Equilibrium found\"); }\n});\n```\n\n**4. LLM Integration:**\n\nLLMs can enrich agent decision-making in these scenarios. For example, LLMs can analyze market sentiment (using libraries like LangChain) and provide input to the `calculateLoss()` or `choosePrice()` functions, making the agents more adaptable.\n\n```javascript\n// Using LangChain to get market sentiment\nconst sentiment = await chain.call({ input });\n\n// Use sentiment data to adjust agent strategy\nconst adjustedPrice = adjustPriceBasedOnSentiment(price1, sentiment);\n```\n\n**5. Visualization and Experimentation:**\n\nLibraries like Chart.js or D3.js can visualize the dynamics of multi-agent interactions, payoff relations, and the convergence (or lack thereof) towards equilibrium in your web application.  This is crucial for understanding the behavior of the system and refining the agents' strategies.\n\n**Further Considerations:**\n\n* **Communication:** Implement communication between agents using WebSockets or server-sent events.\n* **Frameworks:** Consider multi-agent simulation frameworks like Agent.js or frameworks for decentralized applications (dApps) based on Web3 technologies.\n* **Scalability:** Address potential scalability issues as the number of agents and complexity increase.\n\nBy combining the mathematical insights of the research paper with the power of JavaScript libraries and LLMs, developers can create intelligent, adaptive, and interactive web applications based on the principles of multi-agent AI.  This allows for developing complex systems that can handle dynamic situations, negotiate, learn, and achieve optimal outcomes in a variety of online environments.",
  "pseudocode": "No pseudocode block found. However, there are mathematical formulas that can be translated into JavaScript functions. For instance, the payoff function in equation (1) can be represented as follows:\n\n```javascript\nfunction calculateExpectedPayoff(p, s, N, A) {\n  let expectedPayoff = 0;\n\n  // Iterate over all possible action profiles\n  function iterateActionProfiles(a, playerIndex) {\n    if (playerIndex === N.length) {\n      let payoff = s(a); // Access payoff function s\n      let probability = 1;\n      for (let i = 0; i < N.length; i++) {\n        probability *= p[i](a[i]);\n      }\n      expectedPayoff += probability * payoff;\n      return;\n    }\n\n    for (let action of A[playerIndex]) {\n      let nextA = [...a];\n      nextA[playerIndex] = action;\n      iterateActionProfiles(nextA, playerIndex + 1);\n    }\n  }\n\n  iterateActionProfiles([], 0);\n  return expectedPayoff;\n}\n\n\n// Example usage (assuming you have defined N, A, s, and p)\nlet N = [0, 1]; // Two players\nlet A = [[0, 1], [0, 1]]; // Action sets for each player\nlet s = (a) => a[0] + a[1]; // Example payoff function\nlet p = [\n  (action) => action === 0 ? 0.5 : 0.5, // Mixed strategy for player 0\n  (action) => action === 0 ? 0.2 : 0.8 // Mixed strategy for player 1\n];\n\nlet expectedPayoff = calculateExpectedPayoff(p, s, N, A);\nconsole.log(expectedPayoff);\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThis function `calculateExpectedPayoff` calculates the expected payoff for a player given a mixed strategy profile `p`, a payoff function `s`, a set of players `N`, and their action sets `A`. It iterates through all possible combinations of actions, calculates the probability of each combination based on the mixed strategies, and then sums up the payoffs weighted by their probabilities. This directly implements the mathematical formula in equation (1).\n\nSimilar JavaScript functions can be created for other formulas presented in the paper. For example, equation (9) which describes the two-point ZD strategy can also be translated into a JavaScript function that returns the conditional probability density function `Tj`.  Note that, as in the above example, implementing these functions requires defining necessary data structures and helper functions like the payoff function `s` and the mixed strategy function `p`.  These would depend on the specific game being implemented.",
