  "title": "Provably Stable Multi-Agent Routing with Bounded-Delay Adversaries in the Decision Loop",
  "abstract": "Abstract-In this work, we are interested in studying multi-agent routing settings, where adversarial agents are part of the assignment and decision loop, degrading the performance of the fleet by incurring bounded delays while servicing pickup-and-delivery requests. Specifically, we are interested in characterizing conditions on the fleet size and the proportion of adversarial agents for which a routing policy remains stable, where stability for a routing policy is achieved if the number of outstanding requests is uniformly bounded over time. To obtain this characterization, we first establish a threshold on the proportion of adversarial agents above which previously stable routing policies for fully cooperative fleets are provably unstable. We then derive a sufficient condition on the fleet size to recover stability given a maximum proportion of adversarial agents. We empirically validate our theoretical results on a case study on autonomous taxi routing, where we consider transportation requests from real San Francisco taxicab data.",
  "summary": "This paper studies the robustness of multi-agent routing systems, like ride-sharing apps or warehouse robots, when some agents are adversarial (malfunctioning or malicious) and cause delays.  It identifies how many adversarial agents a system can tolerate before becoming unstable (requests piling up indefinitely) and derives a method to calculate how many additional *cooperative* agents are needed to restore stability when facing a certain percentage of adversarial agents.\n\nKey points for LLM-based multi-agent systems:\n\n* **Real-world applicability:**  The bounded-delay adversary model realistically reflects potential issues in LLM agents, like hallucinations or excessively long responses, which can be interpreted as delays.\n* **Stability as a key metric:**  The focus on system stability is crucial for LLM-based applications, as unstable systems become unusable.\n* **Fleet sizing for robustness:** The paper provides a way to estimate the necessary \"fleet size\" (number of LLMs) to maintain a functional application even with some malfunctioning LLMs. This is crucial for deploying robust real-world LLM applications.\n* **Centralized vs. decentralized control:** While the paper uses a centralized control system, its insights on adversary impact and fleet sizing can inform the design of more decentralized, LLM-driven multi-agent systems.\n* **Potential for LLM-driven mitigation:** Future research directions suggested in the paper, such as adversary detection and adaptive mitigation strategies, could leverage LLMs themselves to improve system robustness.  LLMs could be used to monitor other LLMs, identify unusual behavior indicative of adversarial actions, or dynamically adjust resource allocation to compensate for delays.",
  "takeaways": "This research paper offers valuable insights for JavaScript developers working with LLM-based multi-agent systems, particularly in web application contexts. Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply the insights, along with practical examples and relevant JavaScript tools:\n\n**1. Understanding Stability and Adversarial Impact**\n\nThe core concept of \"stability\" translates to ensuring your multi-agent web application remains responsive and functional even when some agents misbehave or are inefficient.  In a web app, this could manifest as chatbots becoming unresponsive, automated trading agents making erratic decisions, or collaborative document editing becoming slow and glitchy.\n\n* **Example Scenario:** Imagine building a multi-agent customer support system where each agent is an LLM-powered chatbot.  Some agents (adversarial by design or due to buggy prompts) might take excessively long turns, hogging resources and delaying responses to other users.\n\n* **JavaScript Application:**  Implement monitoring using libraries like `Prometheus` or custom metrics tracked with a tool like `StatsD`. Monitor key metrics like average response time, the number of outstanding requests (queued messages), and the variance in agent response times. Detect instability by setting thresholds on these metrics.\n\n**2.  Modeling Adversarial Behavior**\n\nThe bounded-delay model provides a way to simulate and anticipate the impact of less-than-perfect agents. You don't need true \"adversaries\" to benefit from this.\n\n* **Example Scenario:** In a collaborative code editor using multi-agent LLMs for code completion/suggestion, some agents might offer less relevant or timely suggestions due to prompt variations or different LLM capabilities.\n\n* **JavaScript Application:** Simulate \"bounded-delay\" by introducing artificial delays or injecting noise into some agents' outputs.  This allows you to test the resilience of your application. Use `setTimeout` or Promises to implement the delays.\n\n**3. Fleet Size Optimization**\n\nThe paperâ€™s focus on fleet size translates to how many LLM agents you need running to handle a given workload effectively.\n\n* **Example Scenario:** A real-time multi-player game where LLM agents control non-player characters (NPCs).  Having too few agents might lead to unresponsive NPCs, while having too many wastes resources.\n\n* **JavaScript Application:** Use load testing tools like `k6` or `Artillery` to simulate many concurrent users interacting with the LLM agents.  Vary the number of active agents (your \"fleet size\") and measure performance metrics like average latency and error rates.  Find the optimal balance based on performance requirements and cost considerations.\n\n**4.  Instantaneous Assignment (Bipartite Matching)**\n\nThough computationally complex, efficiently assigning tasks (incoming requests) to the best available LLM agent becomes crucial in multi-agent web apps.\n\n* **Example Scenario:**  A task management system where LLM agents specialize in different tasks (e.g., writing summaries, generating code, translating text).  Incoming tasks must be routed to the most appropriate agent.\n\n* **JavaScript Application:** Use JavaScript graph libraries like `Cytoscape.js` or `vis.js` to model the agent capabilities and task requirements.  Implement a simplified bipartite matching algorithm, or consider external libraries for more complex scenarios.\n\n**5.  LLM-Specific Considerations**\n\n* **Prompt Engineering for Robustness:**  Design LLM prompts to minimize the chance of generating \"adversarial\" behavior.  Techniques like specifying response length, defining clear roles, and providing context examples can improve agent reliability.\n* **Agent Monitoring and Feedback Loops:** Implement mechanisms to track agent performance and refine LLM prompts based on real-world interactions.  This continuous feedback helps maintain stability over time.\n* **Distributed Agent Frameworks:** For complex multi-agent applications, consider using frameworks like `LangChain` or building upon peer-to-peer communication libraries like `PeerJS` to manage the distributed nature of agents in a web environment.\n\n\nBy applying these insights and using appropriate JavaScript tools, developers can build more robust, scalable, and efficient LLM-based multi-agent web applications that are less vulnerable to the challenges posed by unexpected agent behavior.",
  "pseudocode": "The paper contains two algorithms described in pseudocode. Here are their JavaScript implementations, along with explanations:\n\n**Algorithm 1: Random Assignment Policy**\n\n```javascript\nfunction randomAssignmentPolicy(currentState, outstandingRequests) {\n  const V = []; // Locations of unavailable agents (initialized empty)\n  const d = [...Array(currentState.agentLocations.length).keys()]; // Indices of available agents\n\n  const agentControls = Array(currentState.agentLocations.length).fill(null);\n\n\n  for (let l = 0; l < currentState.agentLocations.length; l++) {\n    if (currentState.expectedTimesRemaining[l] !== 0) {  // Agent is busy\n      const h = getNextHopInGraph(\n        currentState.agentLocations[l],\n        currentState.requests[l].pickup,\n        currentState.requests[l].dropoff\n      );\n      agentControls[l] = h;\n      d.splice(d.indexOf(l),1);\n    }\n  }\n\n  for (const q of outstandingRequests) {\n\n    if(d.length === 0) break; //no available agents\n\n    const la = d[Math.floor(Math.random() * d.length)]; // Randomly select an available agent index\n\n    d.splice(d.indexOf(la),1);\n\n    const T = distance(currentState.agentLocations[la], q.pickup) + distance(q.pickup, q.dropoff);\n    const h = getNextHopInGraph(currentState.agentLocations[la], q.pickup, q.dropoff);\n    agentControls[la] = h;\n    currentState.expectedTimesRemaining[la] = T;\n  }\n\n\n  // remaining agents do not move\n  for(let l = 0; l < currentState.agentLocations.length; l++){\n     if(agentControls[l] === null) agentControls[l] = currentState.agentLocations[l]\n  }\n\n  return agentControls;\n}\n\n\n// Helper functions (not defined in the paper but necessary for implementation)\nfunction getNextHopInGraph(currentLocation, pickup, dropoff) {\n  // This function would use a pathfinding algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra's)\n  // to determine the next node in the shortest path from currentLocation\n  // to pickup (if not picked up yet) or from pickup to dropoff (if already picked up).\n  //  Simplified version for demonstration\n  return /* logic to find the next node towards pickup/dropoff*/;\n\n}\n\nfunction distance(a, b) {\n  // This function would calculate the distance between two nodes in the graph.\n  // Simplified version for demonstration\n  return /* Logic to calculate distance */;\n\n}\n\n//Example currentState object structure\nconst exampleCurrentState = {\n agentLocations: [/* Agent locations */],\n expectedTimesRemaining: [/* Expected time remaining for current trips */],\n requests: [/* Request data for in-progress requests*/] //only for busy agents\n};\n\n//Example outstandingRequests object structure (array of request tuples)\nconst exampleOutstandingRequests = [\n  { pickup: /* pickup location */, dropoff: /* dropoff location */ },\n  // ... more requests\n];\n\n\nconst agentControls = randomAssignmentPolicy(exampleCurrentState, exampleOutstandingRequests);\nconsole.log(agentControls);\n```\n\n*Explanation:* This algorithm assigns available agents to outstanding requests randomly. It prioritizes agents already in transit, continuing their current assignments. For new assignments, it randomly selects an available agent and assigns it to a request.  The primary purpose is to serve as a simpler baseline for comparison with the more sophisticated instantaneous assignment policy.  Note: The JavaScript implementation includes helper functions `getNextHopInGraph` and `distance`, which are not explicitly defined in the pseudocode but are necessary for a complete implementation. These would typically involve graph traversal/shortest path algorithms.\n\n**Algorithm 2: Instantaneous Assignment Policy**\n\n```javascript\nfunction instantaneousAssignmentPolicy(currentState, outstandingRequests) {\n  const V = []; // Locations of unavailable agents\n  let d = [...Array(currentState.agentLocations.length).keys()]; // Indices of available agents\n  const agentControls = Array(currentState.agentLocations.length).fill(null);\n  const currentAgentLocations = [...currentState.agentLocations];\n\n\n  for (let l = 0; l < currentState.agentLocations.length; l++) {\n    if (currentState.expectedTimesRemaining[l] !== 0) {\n      const h = getNextHopInGraph(\n        currentState.agentLocations[l],\n        currentState.requests[l].pickup,\n        currentState.requests[l].dropoff\n      );\n      agentControls[l] = h;\n\n      d.splice(d.indexOf(l),1);\n\n    }\n  }\n\n\n\n  const assignment = performMatchingUsingAuctionAlg(currentAgentLocations, outstandingRequests,d); // Bipartite matching\n\n\n\n  for (const l of assignment.agentIndices) {\n\n    d.splice(d.indexOf(l),1);\n\n    const [pickup, dropoff] = assignment.requestAssignedToAgent[l];\n\n    const T = distance(currentState.agentLocations[l], pickup) + distance(pickup, dropoff);\n    const h = getNextHopInGraph(currentState.agentLocations[l], pickup, dropoff);\n    agentControls[l] = h;\n\n    currentState.expectedTimesRemaining[l] = T;\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  for(let l = 0; l < currentState.agentLocations.length; l++){\n     if(agentControls[l] === null) agentControls[l] = currentState.agentLocations[l]\n  }\n\n\n  return agentControls;\n}\n\n// Helper function (This would be an implementation of a bipartite matching algorithm)\nfunction performMatchingUsingAuctionAlg(agentLocations, requests, availableAgentIndices) {\n\n   const requestAssignedToAgent = {};\n   const agentIndices = [];\n\n\n  // Simplified demonstration - Replace with actual Auction Algorithm logic\n  for(const request of requests){\n      if(availableAgentIndices.length > 0){\n          const closestAgentIndex = /* logic to find closest agent to request.pickup from availableAgentIndices*/;\n\n          requestAssignedToAgent[closestAgentIndex] = [request.pickup, request.dropoff];\n          agentIndices.push(closestAgentIndex);\n          availableAgentIndices.splice(availableAgentIndices.indexOf(closestAgentIndex),1);\n\n      } else {\n        break;\n      }\n  }\n\n\n\n  return { requestAssignedToAgent, agentIndices};\n}\n\n\n// Helper functions (same as Algorithm 1)\nfunction getNextHopInGraph(currentLocation, pickup, dropoff) {\n  // ... (Implementation from Algorithm 1)\n}\n\nfunction distance(a, b) {\n  // ... (Implementation from Algorithm 1)\n}\n\n\nconst agentControlsInstantaneous = instantaneousAssignmentPolicy(exampleCurrentState, exampleOutstandingRequests);\n\nconsole.log(agentControlsInstantaneous);\n\n```\n\n*Explanation:* This algorithm assigns available agents to outstanding requests by solving a bipartite matching problem, aiming to minimize the total travel time. It uses an auction algorithm (or a similar optimal assignment method) implemented in the `performMatchingUsingAuctionAlg` function. This approach aims for a more globally optimized assignment compared to the random approach.  The rest of the structure, including helper functions and assumptions about `getNextHopInGraph` and `distance`, is similar to Algorithm 1.  A simplified implementation of the bipartite matching algorithm is included for demonstration.  A real-world application would involve more complex logic for assignment optimization.",
