  "title": "MAP: Evaluation and Multi-Agent Enhancement of Large Language Models for Inpatient Pathways",
  "abstract": "Inpatient pathways demand complex clinical decision-making based on comprehensive patient information, posing critical challenges for clinicians. Despite advancements in large language models (LLMs) in medical applications, limited research focused on artificial intelligence (AI) inpatient pathways systems, due to the lack of large-scale inpatient datasets. Moreover, existing medical benchmarks typically concentrated on medical question-answering and examinations, ignoring the multifaceted nature of clinical decision-making in inpatient settings. To address these gaps, we first developed the Inpatient Pathway Decision Support (IPDS) benchmark from the MIMIC-IV database, encompassing 51,274 cases across nine triage departments and 17 major disease categories alongside 16 standardized treatment options. Then, we proposed the Multi-Agent Inpatient Pathways (MAP) framework to accomplish inpatient pathways with three clinical agents, including a triage agent managing the patient admission, a diagnosis agent serving as the primary decision maker at the department, and a treatment agent providing treatment plans. Additionally, our MAP framework includes a chief agent overseeing the inpatient pathways to guide and promote these three clinician agents. Extensive experiments showed our MAP improved the diagnosis accuracy by 25.10% compared to the state-of-the-art LLM HuatuoGPT2-13B. It is worth noting that our MAP demonstrated significant clinical compliance, outperforming three board-certified clinicians by 10%-12%, establishing a foundation for inpatient pathways systems.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces a Multi-Agent Inpatient Pathways (MAP) framework, using multiple LLMs acting as specialized agents (triage, diagnosis, treatment, chief) to improve the accuracy and reliability of LLM-based clinical decision support for inpatient care.  It leverages a new benchmark dataset (IPDS) derived from MIMIC-IV, and shows improved performance over single LLMs, even specialized medical ones.  Key multi-agent aspects include: specialized agents collaborating on a defined workflow (triage-diagnosis-treatment), structured communication between agents (context-thinking-answer),  a chief agent providing supervision and guidance during training, and modules for record review, retrieval-augmented generation with a medical knowledge base, and expert guidance.",
  "takeaways": "This research paper presents intriguing opportunities for JavaScript developers working with LLMs in multi-agent web applications. Here are some practical examples of how the MAP framework's concepts can be applied:\n\n**1. Building a Multi-Agent Diagnostic Support System:**\n\n* **Scenario:** A web application assists doctors in diagnosing patient conditions based on symptoms, medical history, and radiological reports.\n* **Agents:**\n    * **Triage Agent:** (Frontend - React/Vue.js)  Collects initial patient data through a form and routes the request to the appropriate specialist diagnosis agent based on preliminary assessment (using a simple LLM or rule-based system).\n    * **Diagnosis Agents (Specialized):** (Backend - Node.js) Each agent (e.g., cardiology, pulmonology) uses a specialized LLM (like Clinical Camel) and the trainable REG module to analyze data and suggest diagnoses. Langchain.js could facilitate interaction with the LLM and vector databases (like Pinecone, Weaviate) storing medical knowledge.\n    * **Treatment Agent:** (Backend - Node.js) Based on the diagnosis, this agent, powered by an LLM, suggests treatment plans and retrieves relevant research papers using the REG module and a vector database of research articles.\n    * **Chief Agent:** (Backend - Node.js) Oversees the other agents, providing feedback during development/training (as described in the \"Expert Guidance\" section).  It can also flag potential inconsistencies between agents or suggest further investigation.  This could be implemented using a higher-level LLM that evaluates the outputs of the other agents.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * Use a message queue (like RabbitMQ, Kafka) or WebSockets for inter-agent communication.\n    * Implement the record review module using Transformers.js and ClinicalBERT to analyze and filter relevant medical data.\n    * Langchain.js can structure the chain-of-thought reasoning and data retrieval.\n\n**2. Collaborative Multi-Agent Content Creation:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  A web application for collaboratively writing medical articles.\n* **Agents:**\n    * **Research Agent:**  Finds relevant research papers and summarizes key findings.\n    * **Writing Agent:**  Drafts sections of the article based on the research and user input.\n    * **Editing Agent:**  Proofreads and refines the text, ensuring consistency and accuracy.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * Use a collaborative text editor like ProseMirror or CKEditor.\n    * Agents can communicate through shared state or a messaging system.\n    * The record review module's concept can be applied to filter and prioritize information from multiple sources.\n\n**3. Interactive Multi-Agent Learning Environment:**\n\n* **Scenario:** A web application for training medical students through simulated patient cases.\n* **Agents:**\n    * **Student Agent:**  Represents the medical student, making diagnostic and treatment decisions.\n    * **Patient Simulator Agent:**  Simulates patient responses based on the student's actions.\n    * **Instructor Agent:**  Provides feedback and guidance to the student.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * Create a visual interface with patient data, options for actions, and feedback displays.\n    * The instructor agent's feedback mechanism could be implemented using reinforcement learning principles.\n\n**Key Considerations for JavaScript Developers:**\n\n* **Agent Communication:**  Choose appropriate technologies for inter-agent communication based on your needs (message queues, WebSockets, shared state).\n* **Data Management:**  Use efficient data structures and databases (like vector databases) to store and retrieve medical knowledge.\n* **LLM Integration:**  Leverage libraries like Langchain.js to simplify interaction with LLMs.\n* **Evaluation:**  Implement appropriate metrics (accuracy, DSMR, etc.) to assess agent performance.\n* **Ethical Considerations:**  Address privacy and security concerns related to handling sensitive medical data.\n\nBy understanding the core principles of the MAP framework – specialized agents, structured communication, data prioritization, and expert guidance – JavaScript developers can unlock the potential of multi-agent LLMs to create innovative and impactful web applications in healthcare and beyond. Remember that experimenting with smaller, focused projects is a great way to start exploring these possibilities.",
