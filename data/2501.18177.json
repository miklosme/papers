  "title": "Investigating Tax Evasion Emergence Using Dual Large Language Model and Deep Reinforcement Learning Powered Agent-based Simulation",
  "abstract": "Tax evasion, usually the largest component of an informal economy, is a persistent challenge over history with significant socio-economic implications. Many socio-economic studies investigate its dynamics, including influencing factors, the role and influence of taxation policies, and the prediction of the tax evasion volume over time. These studies assumed such behavior is given, as observed in the real world, neglecting the \"big bang\" of such activity in a population. To this end, computational economy studies adopted developments in computer simulations, in general, and recent innovations in artificial intelligence (AI), in particular, to simulate and study informal economy appearance in various socio-economic settings. This study presents a novel computational framework to examine the dynamics of tax evasion and the emergence of informal economic activity. Employing an agent-based simulation powered by Large Language Models and Deep Reinforcement Learning, the framework is uniquely designed to allow informal economic behaviors to emerge organically, without presupposing their existence or explicitly signaling agents about the possibility of evasion. This provides a rigorous approach for exploring the socio-economic determinants of compliance behavior. The experimental design, comprising model validation and exploratory phases, demonstrates the framework's robustness in replicating theoretical economic behaviors. Findings indicate that individual personality traits, external narratives, enforcement probabilities, and the perceived efficiency of public goods provision significantly influence both the timing and extent of informal economic activity. The results underscore that efficient public goods provision and robust enforcement mechanisms are complementary; neither alone is sufficient to curtail informal activity effectively. By modeling the emergence of informal economic behavior without assumptions, this research advances the theoretical and practical understanding of tax compliance, offering critical policy insights for designing equitable tax systems and fostering sustainable economic governance.",
  "summary": "This paper investigates the emergence of tax evasion (informal economy) using a multi-agent simulation.  Agents, representing individuals in an economy, make decisions about paying taxes using a combination of a Large Language Model (LLM) for initial suggestions and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for final decisions, considering personal traits (encoded as tweets), government policies, and economic incentives.\n\nKey points for LLM-based multi-agent systems:\n\n* **LLM-DRL Hybrid Agent:**  Agents use LLMs to process complex information (personality, history, policies) and provide initial action suggestions (tax payment amount). DRL then refines these suggestions based on rewards and penalties, creating a more nuanced decision-making process.\n* **Emergent Behavior:** The system is designed to allow informal economic activity (tax evasion) to emerge naturally from agent interactions rather than being pre-programmed.\n* **Personality Modeling:** Agent personalities are modeled using real tweets, providing diverse behavioral traits and influencing tax compliance decisions. Experimentation with synthetic \"pro-tax evasion\" tweets showed a measurable effect on agents' compliance behavior, highlighting the impact of external narratives.\n* **Policy Exploration:** The model simulates the impact of different government policies (tax rates, public goods provision, enforcement) on the emergence and dynamics of tax evasion, offering insights for policy optimization.  Stronger enforcement and better public goods provision decrease tax evasion.\n* **Scalable Simulation:**  The agent-based simulation can be scaled to model larger populations and longer time horizons, allowing for more realistic and complex economic scenarios.",
  "takeaways": "This paper offers several valuable insights for JavaScript developers working on LLM-based multi-agent applications, particularly in simulating socio-economic scenarios. Here are some practical examples focusing on web development:\n\n**1. Simulating User Behavior in Online Marketplaces:**\n\n* **Concept:**  The paper's multi-agent model, driven by LLMs and DRL, can be adapted to simulate user behavior in an online marketplace. Each agent represents a user with a unique personality (powered by LLM-generated text, perhaps from product reviews or user profiles) and purchasing preferences. DRL can guide agents to make decisions based on product prices, availability, and reviews, similar to the buy-sell interactions in the paper.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * **Frontend (React, Vue, etc.):** Create a visual representation of the marketplace, displaying products, prices, and user interactions.\n    * **Backend (Node.js, LangChain):** Implement the multi-agent system. Use a JavaScript LLM library like `LangChain` to interact with LLMs (e.g., Llama 2) to generate user personalities and initial purchasing decisions.  Integrate a DRL library (e.g., `ReinforceJS`) to refine these decisions based on marketplace dynamics.  Expose the simulation data through an API.\n    * **LLM Integration:** Use prompts similar to the paper's examples to generate user personalities. Example:  \"Generate 20 short texts reflecting a user's interest in sustainable products and a preference for budget-friendly options.\"\n    * **DRL Training:** Train the DRL model to maximize a reward function related to user satisfaction (e.g., finding desired products at acceptable prices).\n\n\n**2. Modeling Social Dynamics in Online Communities:**\n\n* **Concept:** Adapt the paper's approach to simulate the spread of information or opinions in online communities. Agents represent users with different personalities and communication styles (again, leveraging LLMs). DRL can guide agents to interact with each other (e.g., posting, commenting, sharing) based on their personalities and the community's dynamics.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * **Frontend (React, Vue, etc.):** Develop a simplified social media interface displaying user posts, comments, and network connections.\n    * **Backend (Node.js, LangChain):**  Use LLMs to generate diverse user personalities and initial opinions on a specific topic.  DRL can then guide agents to interact, influencing each other's opinions over time, mimicking social influence and the spread of narratives as discussed in the paper.  Expose data via an API.\n    * **LLM Prompts:** \"Generate 10 short texts expressing a skeptical viewpoint towards a new technology.\"\n    * **DRL Rewards:** Reward agents for gaining followers or likes (positive social reinforcement).\n\n\n**3. Simulating Economic Impacts of Policy Changes (e.g., Tax Policy):**\n\n* **Concept:** Recreate simplified versions of the paper's tax evasion model in a web application. Allow users to adjust policy parameters (e.g., tax rates, enforcement levels) and observe the impact on agent behavior and the overall economy. This provides an interactive tool for exploring policy implications, similar to the paper's model exploration phase.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * **Frontend (React, D3.js):** Create interactive charts and visualizations to display economic indicators (e.g., informal economy size, tax revenue, agent wealth distribution) and user-adjustable policy sliders.\n    * **Backend (Node.js, LangChain, ReinforceJS):** Implement the multi-agent tax model in JavaScript, mirroring the paper's framework. Use LLMs for agent personalities and DRL for decision-making. Expose the simulation results via an API.\n    * **User Interaction:**  Allow users to modify policy parameters through the frontend interface. The backend updates the simulation parameters, reruns the simulation, and returns updated economic indicators to the frontend for visualization.\n\n\n**Key JavaScript Libraries and Frameworks:**\n\n* **LLM Interaction:** `LangChain` (for interacting with LLMs via APIs and managing prompts), `transformers.js` (client-side inference with smaller LLMs).\n* **Deep Reinforcement Learning:** `ReinforceJS`, `TensorFlow.js`.\n* **Frontend Development:** React, Vue, Angular, D3.js (for visualizations).\n* **Backend Development:** Node.js, Express.js.\n\n\nThese examples illustrate how the paper's core concepts can be translated into practical JavaScript-based multi-agent projects.  Remember to adjust the complexity of the models and the level of detail based on the specific application and available resources.  Start with simplified scenarios and gradually increase complexity as needed. This approach enables practical experimentation with LLM-powered multi-agent systems, paving the way for more advanced simulations and applications in web development.",
