  "title": "Synthesising Robust Controllers for Robot Collectives with Recurrent Tasks: A Case Study",
  "abstract": "When designing correct-by-construction controllers for autonomous collectives, three key challenges are the task specification, the modelling, and its use at practical scale. In this paper, we focus on a simple yet useful abstraction for high-level controller synthesis for robot collectives with optimisation goals (e.g., maximum cleanliness, minimum energy consumption) and recurrence (e.g., re-establish contamination and charge thresholds) and safety (e.g., avoid full discharge, mutually exclusive room occupation) constraints. Due to technical limitations (related to scalability and using constraints in the synthesis), we simplify our graph-based setting from a stochastic two-player game into a single-player game on a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). Robustness against environmental uncertainty is encoded via partial observability. Linear-time correctness properties are verified separately after synthesising the POMDP strategy. We contribute at-scale guidance on POMDP modelling and controller synthesis for tasked robot collectives exemplified by the scenario of battery-driven robots responsible for cleaning public buildings with utilisation constraints.",
  "summary": "This paper explores automatically creating robust cleaning schedules for teams of robots in buildings like schools.  It uses a simplified model of the environment and robot capabilities, focusing on navigation, battery life, and room contamination levels.  A partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) is used for strategy synthesis, allowing for uncertainty in contamination levels. This synthesized strategy is then used to generate a concrete cleaning schedule.  Scalability is addressed by using partial observability and composing robot movements concurrently.\n\nKey points for LLM-based multi-agent systems: The use of POMDPs for strategy synthesis offers a way to handle uncertainty in multi-agent environments, a common challenge with LLMs.  The simplified model, focusing on key variables and abstracting away details, is relevant to managing the complexity of LLM-based multi-agent simulations.  The focus on synthesizing a high-level strategy and then generating a concrete schedule could be applicable to coordinating actions in LLM-based multi-agent systems.  Finally, the paper highlights challenges in scalability and parameter selection, which are directly relevant to working with complex LLM-based multi-agent applications.",
  "takeaways": "This paper explores synthesizing robust controllers for robot collectives with recurrent tasks using POMDPs. While the context is robotics, the underlying principles of multi-agent coordination, task scheduling, and handling uncertainty are highly relevant to LLM-based multi-agent web applications. Let's translate these insights into practical examples for JavaScript developers.\n\n**Scenario:** Imagine building a collaborative web application for writing stories, where multiple LLMs act as agents, each specializing in different aspects like character development, plot progression, dialogue, and world-building.\n\n**Applying the Paper's Insights:**\n\n1. **Decentralized Coordination (CPNs):** The paper uses Colored Petri Nets (CPNs) for modeling multi-agent coordination.  In our story writing app, this translates to defining clear roles and responsibilities for each LLM agent.  We can use a message-passing system (like those found in libraries such as `socket.io` or using a backend message broker like RabbitMQ with a JavaScript client) to manage communication and task assignment.  For example:\n\n```javascript\n// Agent specializing in dialogue\nsocket.on('generate_dialogue', (context) => {\n  // Use LLM to generate dialogue based on context\n  let dialogue = llm.generate(context); \n  socket.emit('dialogue_ready', dialogue);\n});\n\n// Agent specializing in plot\nsocket.on('dialogue_ready', (dialogue) => {\n  // Update plot based on the generated dialogue\n  let newPlotPoint = llm.generatePlotPoint(dialogue);\n  socket.emit('plot_updated', newPlotPoint);\n});\n```\n\n2. **Task Scheduling and Recurrence:**  The paper emphasizes recurrent tasks. In our app, this could be a regular check for plot consistency, character development arcs, or world-building details.  We can use Node.js with libraries like `node-cron` for scheduling these recurring checks:\n\n```javascript\nconst cron = require('node-cron');\n\ncron.schedule('*/5 * * * *', () => {  // Run every 5 minutes\n  socket.emit('check_consistency', {}); // Trigger consistency check by agents\n});\n```\n\n3. **Handling Uncertainty (POMDPs):** LLMs are probabilistic. Their output can be unpredictable.  We can apply the POMDP concept by creating a \"belief state\" for each agent, tracking its confidence level in its generated content. This could be based on metrics like the LLM's internal confidence scores, or external validation mechanisms (e.g., user feedback or consistency checks with other agents).\n\n```javascript\n// Example of a belief state update\nlet beliefState = { confidence: 0.8 }; \n\nfunction updateBelief(feedback) {\n  if (feedback.positive) {\n    beliefState.confidence += 0.1;\n  } else {\n    beliefState.confidence -= 0.2;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n4. **Strategy Synthesis and Verification:**  The paper uses PRISM for strategy synthesis. While direct PRISM integration is challenging in a JavaScript environment, the core idea is to create a feedback loop for evaluating and refining the agents' strategies. We can use A/B testing frameworks or reinforcement learning libraries (e.g., `ml5.js` or `brain.js`) to experiment with different strategies and optimize their performance over time.\n\n5. **JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries:**  For building the web application itself, we can leverage frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular for the frontend, and Node.js with Express for the backend.  Libraries like TensorFlow.js can be used for more advanced machine learning tasks related to belief state updates or strategy optimization.\n\n\n**Simplified Example:**\n\nImagine a basic two-agent setup: one LLM generates sentences, the other evaluates their grammatical correctness. The evaluator agent's belief state is its confidence in the grammatical accuracy.  If the confidence falls below a threshold, the evaluator can request a re-generation. This simplified example demonstrates the core principle of handling uncertainty with a \"belief state.\"\n\n\nBy applying these principles, JavaScript developers can build robust, efficient, and adaptable multi-agent web applications that leverage the power of LLMs while managing their inherent uncertainty. This research provides a solid conceptual framework for approaching such projects, inspiring new ideas and solutions in the exciting world of multi-agent AI-driven web development.",
  "pseudocode": "No pseudocode block found. However, there are examples of PRISM code (a probabilistic model checker) throughout the paper.  These snippets illustrate how to model the robotic cleaning scenario using PRISM's guarded command language. While not pseudocode in the traditional sense, they represent algorithmic logic and can be translated into JavaScript conceptualizations to help a JS developer understand the underlying multi-agent concepts.\n\nHere are a few examples and their JavaScript interpretations:\n\n**Listing 1 (Simplified):**\n\n```prism\nmodule Example\nx : [0..2] init 0; \n[increase] x<2 -> (x'=x+1); \nendmodule\n```\n\n**JavaScript Conceptualization:**\n\n```javascript\nclass Example {\n  constructor() {\n    this.x = 0;\n  }\n\n  increase() {\n    if (this.x < 2) {\n      this.x++;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nlet example = new Example();\nexample.increase(); // x becomes 1\nexample.increase(); // x becomes 2\nexample.increase(); // x remains 2 (condition prevents further increase)\n```\n\n**Explanation:** This PRISM module represents a simple counter. The JavaScript code uses a class to encapsulate the state (`x`) and the `increase` method mirrors the PRISM command. The `if` statement implements the guard condition `x<2`. This highlights the state-based nature of the system.\n\n**Listing 2 (Fragment - Simplified):**\n\n```prism\nmodule cleaners\nx : [0..m-1] init B1.start; \nc: [0..B1.maxcharge] init B1.@chgthres; \n[at0] (x=0|x=1) -> (x'=0) & (c=min(c+B1.chargerate, B1.maxcharge));\n[at1] ... -> ...\nendmodule\n```\n\n**JavaScript Conceptualization:**\n\n```javascript\nclass Cleaner {\n  constructor(start, maxCharge, chargeThreshold, chargeRate, dischargeRate) {\n    this.x = start; // Room/Charger location\n    this.c = chargeThreshold; // Initial Battery\n    this.maxCharge = maxCharge;\n    this.chargeRate = chargeRate;\n    this.dischargeRate = dischargeRate;\n  }\n\n  at0() {\n    if (this.x === 0 || this.x === 1) { // Charger locations are 0 & 1.\n      this.x = 0; // Stay or move to charger 0\n      this.c = Math.min(this.c + this.chargeRate, this.maxCharge); // Charge battery\n    }\n  }\n\n  at1(newX) { // Simplified move action.\n      this.x = newX;\n      this.c = Math.max(this.c - this.dischargeRate, 0);\n  }\n  // ... other atN methods\n}\n\n\nlet cleaner = new Cleaner(1, 100, 50, 10, 2); // Example initialization\ncleaner.at0();\nconsole.log(cleaner.c) // Output: 60\ncleaner.at1(2)\nconsole.log(cleaner.c) // Output: 58\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:** This represents a single cleaning robot. The `at0` action models charging at a station. The JavaScript translation uses a class representing the robot, with properties for location (`x`), charge (`c`), and charging parameters.  The `at0` method again demonstrates the guarded command structure, only executing its logic when the robot is at a valid charging location. The example also introduces a simplified `at1` which corresponds to a move action which uses a parameter to determine which place the robot is moving to.\n\n**Key Concepts for JavaScript Developers:**\n\n* **State-Based Systems:**  Multi-agent systems and PRISM models heavily rely on the concept of state. Each agent (robot) has a state, and actions change those states.  JavaScript developers can represent states using objects or classes.\n* **Guarded Commands:**  PRISM uses guarded commands (`[action] guard -> updates`). The actions only occur if the guard condition is true.  This is readily translated to `if` statements in JavaScript.\n* **Nondeterminism and Probabilities:** PRISM models often involve probabilities and nondeterminism (multiple possible actions). The paper uses strategies (policies) to resolve this nondeterminism. In JavaScript, this could be simulated by randomly choosing actions based on probabilities, or by implementing more complex decision-making logic.\n\n\nBy translating these PRISM code snippets into JavaScript-like structures, software engineers can grasp the fundamental principles of modeling state, actions, and transitions, which are key to developing LLM-based multi-agent web applications.  The paper then discusses using PRISM to *synthesise* strategies (sequences of actions for the robots), a concept that can inform high-level decision making in more complex JavaScript agent systems.",
