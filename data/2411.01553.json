  "title": "LEARNING TO CONSTRUCT IMPLICIT COMMUNICATION CHANNEL",
  "abstract": "Effective communication is an essential component in collaborative multi-agent systems. Situations where explicit messaging is not feasible have been common in human society throughout history, which motivate the study of implicit communication. Previous works on learning implicit communication mostly rely on theory of mind (ToM), where agents infer the mental states and intentions of others by interpreting their actions. However, ToM-based methods become less effective in making accurate inferences in complex tasks. In this work, we propose the Implicit Channel Protocol (ICP) framework, which allows agents to construct implicit communication channels similar to the explicit ones. ICP leverages a subset of actions, denoted as the scouting actions, and a mapping between information and these scouting actions that encodes and decodes the messages. We propose training algorithms for agents to message and act, including learning with a randomly initialized information map and with a delayed information map. The efficacy of ICP has been tested on the tasks of Guessing Number, Revealing Goals, and Hanabi, where ICP significantly outperforms baseline methods through more efficient information transmission.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces Implicit Channel Protocol (ICP), a framework for multi-agent communication without explicit message passing. Agents use a subset of actions, called \"scouting actions,\" with minimal impact on the environment, to convey information.  A shared mapping translates information into these actions, creating an implicit communication channel.\n\nKey points for LLM-based multi-agent systems:\n\n* ICP offers a way for LLMs to communicate implicitly through actions rather than relying solely on explicit natural language messages.  This could be beneficial in scenarios where direct communication is costly or restricted.\n* The \"scouting actions\" could be analogous to specific LLM-generated outputs that have agreed-upon meanings within a multi-agent system, allowing for efficient information exchange.\n*  The concept of a learned communication protocol, as opposed to a predefined one, is highly relevant to LLMs, which can learn complex communication strategies.  This allows for greater flexibility and adaptability in multi-agent systems.\n* ICP's focus on efficient information transmission is directly applicable to LLM-based systems, where generating and processing natural language can be computationally expensive.  Using implicit communication can reduce this overhead.",
  "takeaways": "This paper introduces the Implicit Channel Protocol (ICP), a method for enabling communication between AI agents without explicit message passing, particularly useful in environments with limited communication bandwidth or where covert communication is needed. Here are practical examples of how a JavaScript developer could apply these insights to LLM-based multi-agent AI projects for the web:\n\n**1. Collaborative Text Editing with LLMs:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Multiple users, each represented by an LLM agent, collaborate on writing a document in real-time within a browser-based text editor.  Direct communication between LLMs could create a performance bottleneck.\n\n* **ICP Application:** Instead of direct messages, agents use \"scouting actions\" – specific text edits like adding or removing formatting (bold, italics, underline), inserting special characters (e.g., emojis relevant to content), or making small, semantically neutral changes (e.g., synonyms).  These actions, while affecting the document minimally, convey implicit information about the agent's intentions or focus.  For example, an agent bolding a sentence could implicitly signal that it considers this sentence crucial.\n\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**  A custom editor built with frameworks like ProseMirror, TipTap, or Slate.js could track and interpret these scouting actions. The server-side component, likely using Node.js, could coordinate the agents and implement the shared protocol for interpreting these actions.\n\n**2. Multi-Agent Game Development:**\n\n* **Scenario:** A browser-based strategy game where multiple players, each controlled by an LLM agent, compete.  Minimizing communication overhead improves responsiveness.\n\n* **ICP Application:** Agents use in-game actions with negligible impact on game state (e.g., briefly hovering units over specific locations, quickly selecting and deselecting units) to convey intentions like planned attacks or feigned retreats.\n\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**  A game framework like Phaser or Babylon.js could be used.  Custom logic would track and interpret these scouting actions, converting them into insights for other agents.  PeerJS or Socket.IO could be used for minimal coordination to ensure the protocol's shared understanding.\n\n**3.  LLM-Powered Chatbots for Customer Support:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Multiple specialized chatbots, each an LLM agent, handle different customer service areas (e.g., billing, technical support, order tracking). They need to cooperate seamlessly without overwhelming the server with inter-bot communication.\n\n* **ICP Application:** Chatbots use subtle cues like the use of specific emojis, very short delays in response, or specific phrasing patterns, undetectable by humans, to signal their internal state or request assistance from another bot. For example, a billing bot detecting a technical issue could subtly indicate it needs technical support bot intervention.\n\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**  A chatbot framework built using React or Vue.js on the front-end and Node.js on the backend. Custom logic would implement and interpret these implicit signals.  This allows the chatbots to collaborate effectively without explicit message exchange.\n\n\n**Key JavaScript Considerations:**\n\n* **Shared Protocol:** The core of ICP is a shared protocol for interpreting \"scouting actions.\"  This needs to be carefully designed and implemented in JavaScript, accessible to all agents.\n\n* **Action Mapping:** JavaScript code needs to handle the mapping between the LLM's output and the available scouting actions.  This might involve using libraries for embedding vectors or calculating probabilities for different actions.\n\n* **Real-time Interpretation:**  The web is a real-time environment. JavaScript code needs to handle the interpretation of scouting actions efficiently to maintain smooth interactions. This might involve using Web Workers or other asynchronous techniques.\n\n* **Experimentation:** The paper emphasizes the importance of experimenting with different mapping strategies and training methods. Libraries like TensorFlow.js can be used for training and fine-tuning agents directly in the browser.\n\n\nBy adapting ICP's principles, JavaScript developers can create more efficient and scalable LLM-based multi-agent applications for the web. This approach also opens up possibilities for innovative interaction paradigms where implicit communication plays a central role.",

The core idea is to enable agents to communicate implicitly through a subset of their actions (scouting actions) without an explicit communication channel.  Here’s a breakdown:\n\n1. **Initialization:** Sets up the neural networks (`theta1`, `theta2` for action and message policy respectively, and `p` for the mapping function), target networks, and other hyperparameters.\n2. **Training Loop:** Iterates over a specified number of training steps.\n3. **Episode Loop:**  Within each training step, runs an episode of interaction with the environment.\n4. **Agent Loop:** In each time step, iterates through each agent.\n5. **Message and Action Selection:** Each agent samples a message using Gumbel-Softmax (to allow for differentiation during training) and an action using an epsilon-greedy strategy.\n6. **Implicit Communication:** If the chosen action is `send_info`, the agent uses the mapping function `p` to convert the sampled message into a scouting action. This action is executed in the environment, implicitly communicating the message to other agents who observe it.  Target network updates for messages are performed as well using target networks (`targetPhi2`).\n7. **Environment Interaction:** The chosen actions (regular or scouting) are executed in the environment.\n8. **Storing and Learning:** The algorithm stores Q-values, rewards, and performs updates based on the TD-error using the Adam optimizer.  The target networks are periodically updated to stabilize training.\n9. **Return Trained Model:** After the training loop finishes, the algorithm returns the trained model parameters.\n\n\n**Purpose:**\n\nThe purpose of this algorithm is to train agents to effectively coordinate and achieve shared goals in a partially observable environment without explicit communication.  ICP achieves this by enabling agents to learn a mapping between information they want to convey and a subset of their actions, thereby constructing an implicit communication channel through the environment itself.  This approach offers potential advantages in scenarios where explicit communication is costly or infeasible.",
