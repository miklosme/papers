  "title": "FJ-MM: The Friedkin-Johnsen Opinion Dynamics Model with Memory and Higher-Order Neighbors",
  "abstract": "The Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) model has been extensively explored and validated, spanning applications in social science, systems and control, game theory, and algorithmic research. In this paper, we introduce an advanced generalization of the FJ model, termed FJ-MM which incorporates both memory effects and multi-hop (higher-order neighbor) influence. This formulation allows agents to naturally incorporate both current and previous opinions at each iteration stage. Our numerical results demonstrate that incorporating memory and multi-hop influence significantly reshapes the opinion landscape; for example, the final opinion profile can exhibit reduced polarization. We analyze the stability and equilibrium properties of the FJ-MM model, showing that these properties can be reduced to those of a comparison modelâ€”namely, the standard FJ model with a modified influence matrix. This reduction enables us to leverage established stability results from FJ dynamics. Additionally, we examine the convergence rate of the FJ-MM model and demonstrate that, as can be expected, the time lags introduced by memory and higher-order neighbor influences result in slower convergence.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces FJ-MM, an extension of the Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) model for opinion dynamics. FJ-MM incorporates memory and multi-hop influence, allowing agents to consider past opinions and indirect influence from non-adjacent neighbors. This reduces opinion polarization and alters the equilibrium.  Importantly for LLM-based multi-agent systems, FJ-MM highlights that considering past interactions and indirect influences (analogous to message history and multi-agent communication pathways) can significantly reshape the outcome landscape, even in simple linear models.  While improving realism, these additions also slow down convergence.  Further, the paper analyses the convergence rate and stability of FJ-MM, demonstrating its dependence on network topology and agent susceptibility to influence.  This is directly applicable to multi-agent systems where the communication network and agents' responsiveness to others' messages are key design parameters.",
  "takeaways": "This research paper introduces FJ-MM, an extension of the Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) model for opinion dynamics, incorporating memory and multi-hop influences. Let's translate these concepts into practical examples for a JavaScript developer building LLM-based multi-agent web applications.\n\n**Scenario 1: Collaborative Writing with LLMs**\n\nImagine building a collaborative writing platform where multiple LLM agents contribute to a document. Each agent has its own writing style (innate opinion) and can be influenced by other agents' contributions.\n\n* **FJ Model (Basic Influence):**  An agent's next contribution is a weighted average of its own previous contribution and the current contributions of other agents.  You could implement this using a JavaScript library like `math.js` for matrix operations. The influence weights (represented by matrix `W`) could be based on factors like the agent's perceived expertise or writing quality.\n```javascript\n// Simplified example using math.js\nconst math = require('math.js');\n\nconst currentContributions = [agent1Text, agent2Text, agent3Text];\nconst influenceMatrix = math.matrix([[0.5, 0.2, 0.3], [0.1, 0.6, 0.3], [0.2, 0.3, 0.5]]);\nconst susceptibility = 0.8; \n\nconst nextContribution = (agentIndex, previousContribution) => {\n  const weightedInfluence = math.multiply(influenceMatrix.subset(math.index(agentIndex, math.range(0, currentContributions.length))), currentContributions);\n  return susceptibility * previousContribution + (1 - susceptibility) * weightedInfluence; \n};\n\nlet agent1NextContribution = nextContribution(0, agent1PreviousContribution);\n```\n* **FJ-MM (Memory and Multi-hop):**  Now, consider that agents also remember past contributions and are indirectly influenced by agents they don't directly interact with (multi-hop).  This is where FJ-MM comes in.  The `W(2)` matrix could represent the influence of previous contributions, and multi-hop influences can be modelled as powers of the `W` matrix (e.g., `W^2` for two-hop influence).  You can use a library like `ml-matrix` to efficiently compute matrix powers.\n```javascript\n// Simplified example (building on previous)\nconst mlMatrix = require('ml-matrix');\n\nconst previousContributions = [agent1PrevText, agent2PrevText, agent3PrevText];\nconst memoryInfluenceMatrix = math.matrix([[0.3, 0.1, 0.1], ...]); // W(2)\nconst memoryWeight = 0.2;\n\nconst nextContributionMM = (agentIndex, previousContribution, prevPrevContribution) => {\n  const weightedCurrent = /* ... as before ... */;\n  const weightedPast = math.multiply(memoryInfluenceMatrix.subset(...), previousContributions);\n\n  return susceptibility * ( (1-memoryWeight) * weightedCurrent + memoryWeight * weightedPast) + ...;\n}\n\nlet agent1NextContributionMM = nextContributionMM(0, agent1PreviousContribution, agent1PrevPrevContribution);\n```\n* **Practical Implications:** This could lead to more diverse and coherent text, as agents retain context and learn from each other indirectly.\n\n**Scenario 2: Multi-Agent Chatbots**\n\nConsider a customer support system with multiple LLM chatbots specializing in different areas.  Customers interact with the chatbots, and the chatbots can consult each other to provide comprehensive answers.\n\n* **FJ-MM for Information Sharing:** Chatbots can incorporate past interactions (memory) and learn from the expertise of other chatbots indirectly (multi-hop). For instance, a chatbot specializing in billing could learn from a chatbot specializing in technical support through indirect interaction with a general customer service chatbot.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**  Use a message queue (like RabbitMQ or Kafka) or a real-time database (like Firebase) to manage communication between chatbots.  Implement the FJ-MM influence mechanism in the message processing logic of each chatbot. A framework like Socket.IO could be used for real-time communication.\n\n**Scenario 3: Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)**\n\nImagine building a DAO managed by multiple LLM agents. These agents vote on proposals, and their opinions evolve based on the votes of other agents.\n\n* **FJ-MM for Voting Dynamics:** Agents' voting patterns can be modeled using FJ-MM, incorporating past votes and the influence of other agents.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**  Use a blockchain platform (like Ethereum) and a JavaScript library like `web3.js` to manage the DAO's voting process.  Implement the FJ-MM dynamics in the smart contracts that govern the voting rules.\n\n**Key Takeaways for JavaScript Developers:**\n\n* **Matrix Libraries:** Leverage JavaScript matrix libraries like `math.js`, `ml-matrix`, or `numjs` for efficient matrix operations needed in FJ-MM.\n* **Communication Mechanisms:**  Utilize message queues, real-time databases, or blockchain platforms to manage communication and data sharing between agents.\n* **LLM Integration:** Use JavaScript libraries and frameworks for LLM interaction, such as LangChain.js or LlamaIndex.js, and incorporate the FJ-MM influence mechanism in the LLM prompt engineering or response processing.\n* **Visualization:**  Use JavaScript visualization libraries like D3.js or Chart.js to visualize the opinion dynamics of the multi-agent system.\n\nBy understanding the concepts of memory and multi-hop influence, JavaScript developers can build more sophisticated and realistic multi-agent web applications powered by LLMs. Remember that FJ-MM provides a theoretical framework.  Experiment with different parameter values and network structures to find the optimal configuration for your specific application.",
