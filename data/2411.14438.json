  "title": "Agent-Based Modeling for Multimodal Transportation of CO2 for Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage: CCUS-Agentâ€ ",
  "abstract": "To understand the system-level interactions between the entities in Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS), an agent-based foundational modeling tool, CCUS-Agent, is developed for a large-scale study of transportation flows and infrastructure in the United States. Key features of the tool include (i) modular design, (ii) multiple transportation modes, (iii) capabilities for extension, and (iv) testing against various system components and networks of small and large sizes. Five matching algorithms for CO2 supply agents (e.g., powerplants and industrial facilities) and demand agents (e.g., storage and utilization sites) are explored: Most Profitable First Year (MPFY), Most Profitable All Years (MPAY), Shortest Total Distance First Year (SDFY), Shortest Total Distance All Years (SDAY), and Shortest distance to long-haul transport All Years (ACAY). Before matching, the supply agent, demand agent, and route must be available, and the connection must be profitable. A profitable connection means the supply agent portion of revenue from the 45Q tax credit must cover the supply agent costs and all transportation costs, while the demand agent revenue portion must cover all demand agent costs. A case study employing over 5,500 supply and demand agents and multimodal CCUS transportation infrastructure in the contiguous United States is conducted. The results suggest that it is possible to capture over 9 billion tonnes (GT) of CO2 from 2025 to 2043, which will increase significantly to 22 GT if the capture costs are reduced by 40%. The MPFY and SDFY algorithms capture more CO2 earlier in the time horizon, while the MPAY and SDAY algorithms capture more later in the time horizon.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces CCUS-Agent, a multi-agent simulation model for optimizing Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) transportation in the US.  The model simulates interactions between CO2 supply agents (power plants, industrial facilities), demand agents (storage sites, utilization facilities), and transportation networks (pipeline, rail, water, truck) under various cost and policy scenarios.\n\nKey points for LLM-based multi-agent systems:\n\n* **Agent-based modeling:**  The system uses decentralized agents (supply, demand, transport) interacting based on individual incentives and constraints.  This aligns with the core principles of multi-agent systems.\n* **Complex System Dynamics:** The model captures emergent behavior from the interactions of many agents, providing a more realistic view than optimization approaches that assume perfect information. This is a strength of multi-agent simulations, and LLMs can bring additional nuance to agent behavior.\n* **Matching Algorithms:** The paper explores various algorithms for matching supply and demand agents, analogous to task allocation in multi-agent systems. LLMs could be used to develop more sophisticated dynamic matching strategies.\n* **Policy Impact Evaluation:**  Simulating 45Q tax credit and other policy incentives demonstrates the potential of multi-agent systems to assess real-world policy interventions.  LLMs could further analyze policy impacts by reasoning about policy features and agent responses.\n* **Scenario Planning:** The model supports what-if analyses by varying costs, transport options, and other parameters.  This is directly applicable to multi-agent systems, where LLMs can generate and evaluate diverse scenarios.\n* **Scalability:**  The model simulates a large-scale, complex system.  This demonstrates the potential for developing large-scale multi-agent systems, where LLMs could be used for coordination, negotiation, and learning amongst agents.\n* **Modularity & Extensibility:** The modular design of the model could be replicated in LLM-based multi-agent systems, enabling flexibility and easier integration of new agents and behaviors.  LLMs can be used as modular components within these agents.\n\nThe paper showcases how an agent-based model, potentially enhanced by LLMs in the future, can support complex decisions in real-world applications like CCUS.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents CCUS-Agent, a multi-agent simulation for optimizing CO2 transportation. While the paper uses ExtendSim, its core concepts are highly relevant to JavaScript developers building LLM-based multi-agent web apps. Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights:\n\n**1. Agent Design and Interactions:**\n\n* **Concept:** The paper defines distinct agent types (supply, demand) with specific properties (start date, capacity, cost, etc.) and behaviors (connecting, transporting, completing).  This modular design translates well to JavaScript objects.\n* **JavaScript Application:** Create JavaScript classes for `SupplyAgent` and `DemandAgent`.  Properties can be stored as object attributes.  Behaviors can be implemented as methods, like `connect()`, `transport()`, and `complete()`.  LLMs can enrich agent behavior by enabling dynamic decision-making based on current system state, similar to the paper's matching algorithms.\n\n```javascript\nclass SupplyAgent {\n  constructor(id, type, location, capacity, cost, startDate) {\n    // ...\n  }\n\n  async connect(demandAgents) {\n    // Use LLM to evaluate potential connections based on various factors\n    const bestConnection = await this.llm.evaluateConnections(this, demandAgents);\n    // ... connection logic ...\n  }\n  // ... other methods ...\n}\n\n// Similar DemandAgent class\n```\n\n* **Framework:**  LangChain is excellent for structuring LLM interactions within agents.  Frameworks like Agents.js or Mace can manage agent communication and coordination.\n\n**2. Matching Algorithms and Optimization:**\n\n* **Concept:**  The paper explores different matching algorithms (MPFY, MPAY, etc.) to optimize CO2 capture. This highlights the importance of algorithm selection for multi-agent system efficiency.\n* **JavaScript Application:** Implement these algorithms in JavaScript. Use libraries like TensorFlow.js or Web Workers for efficient computation. LLMs can be incorporated to generate new, more adaptive matching strategies based on simulation results. Consider using LangChain's agent toolkits for easy implementation and experimentation of new strategies.\n\n\n```javascript\nasync function mpfay(supplyAgents, demandAgents) {\n    // Implement MPAY algorithm\n    const agentConnections = [];\n    for (const agent of supplyAgents) {\n      agentConnections.push(await agent.connect(demandAgents));\n    }\n    return agentConnections;\n}\n```\n\n**3. System Dynamics and Simulation:**\n\n* **Concept:**  The CCUS-Agent model simulates system evolution over time, considering factors like transportation network development and agent availability.\n* **JavaScript Application:** Build a simulation loop using `requestAnimationFrame` or `setInterval`. Update agent states and system variables in each step. Visualize simulation results using libraries like D3.js or Chart.js.  LLMs can model unpredictable events or external factors within the simulation, creating a more robust model.\n\n**4. Cost Modeling and Analysis:**\n\n* **Concept:** The paper includes detailed cost modeling for capture, storage, and transportation. This allows for profit analysis and informs decision-making.\n* **JavaScript Application:**  Represent costs as JavaScript objects or functions.  Use the simulation results to track costs over time.  LLMs can be used to predict future costs based on historical data and external factors, refining the model's accuracy.\n\n**5. Visualization and User Interface:**\n\n* **Concept:**  Clear visualization is crucial for understanding complex multi-agent systems.  A web interface allows for user interaction and exploration of simulation scenarios.\n* **JavaScript Application:** Use React, Vue, or Svelte to create an interactive web interface for the simulation. Integrate visualization libraries like Three.js or Leaflet to display agent locations, transportation networks, and simulation results.  LLMs can generate natural language explanations of the simulation results, making the system more accessible to non-technical users.\n\n**Example Scenario: Decentralized Ride-Sharing**\n\nImagine a decentralized ride-sharing app using LLMs and multi-agent systems.  Riders and drivers are agents.  LLMs handle communication, negotiate prices, and optimize routes based on real-time traffic and demand.  The paper's matching algorithms can be adapted to match riders and drivers efficiently. The cost model can account for distance, time, and surge pricing.\n\nBy combining the concepts presented in the paper with JavaScript tools and LLM capabilities, developers can build sophisticated multi-agent web applications that address complex real-world problems. This paper provides a solid foundation for understanding and implementing such systems.",
  "pseudocode": "No pseudocode block found. However, the paper describes five matching algorithms: MPFY, MPAY, SDFY, SDAY, and ACAY.  While not presented in pseudocode, their logic can be translated into JavaScript functions.  Here's a conceptual representation of how you might implement them:\n\n```javascript\n// Data Structures (Illustrative)\nconst supplyAgents = [\n  { id: 1, type: 'powerPlant', startYear: 2025, co2Available: 1000, captureCost: 70 },\n  // ... more supply agents\n];\n\nconst demandAgents = [\n  { id: 101, type: 'storage', available: true, cost: 10 },\n  // ... more demand agents\n];\n\nconst routes = [\n  { \n    sourceId: 1, \n    destinationId: 101, \n    mode: 'pipeline', \n    distance: 500, \n    availableYear: 2025,\n    transportCostPerTonneMile: 0.0161,\n    capitalInvestmentCostPerMile: 784198 \n  },\n  // ... more routes\n];\n\nconst taxCredit = {\n  storage: { industrial: 85, dac: 180 },\n  utilization: { industrial: 60, dac: 130}\n};\n\n// Helper Functions\nfunction isProfitable(supplyAgent, demandAgent, route, year) {\n  const transportCost = route.transportCostPerTonneMile * supplyAgent.co2Available * route.distance;\n  const capitalInvestmentCost = (route.availableYear === year) ? route.capitalInvestmentCostPerMile * route.distance : 0; // Simplified, assuming cost occurs in available year\n\n  const supplyAgentRevenue = taxCredit[demandAgent.type][supplyAgent.type || 'industrial'] * supplyAgent.co2Available; // Simplified access to tax credits based on agent types\n  const demandAgentRevenue = supplyAgentRevenue;  // Example, may vary depending on scenario\n  \n  return (supplyAgentRevenue >= supplyAgent.captureCost * supplyAgent.co2Available + transportCost + capitalInvestmentCost) &&\n         (demandAgentRevenue >= demandAgent.cost * supplyAgent.co2Available);\n}\n\n// Matching Algorithms (Simplified Examples)\nfunction MPFY(year) {\n  // ... Logic to find the first profitable connection for each supply agent in the given year.\n}\n\nfunction MPAY(year) {\n  // ... Logic to find the most profitable connection over the entire time horizon.\n}\n\nfunction SDFY(year) {\n  // ... Logic to find the shortest distance profitable connection in the given year.\n}\n\nfunction SDAY(year) {\n  // ... Logic to find the shortest total distance profitable connection over the entire time horizon.\n}\n\nfunction ACAY(year) {\n  // ... Logic to find connection minimizing first/last leg distances.\n}\n\n// Example Usage\nconst matches = MPFY(2025);\nconsole.log(matches);\n\n// ... Implement the other algorithms and integrate with simulation logic.\n\n```\n\n**Explanation of Algorithms and their Purpose:**\n\n* **MPFY (Most Profitable First Year):**  Prioritizes immediate profit maximization.  For each supply agent, this algorithm selects the demand agent and route combination that yields the highest profit in the current year, if a profitable connection exists. This is a greedy algorithm that doesn't consider future opportunities.\n\n* **MPAY (Most Profitable All Years):** Takes a long-term view and selects connections to maximize profit across the entire simulation timeframe. It considers future infrastructure development and might delay a connection if a more profitable one becomes available later.\n\n* **SDFY (Shortest Total Distance First Year):**  Prioritizes minimizing transportation distances in the current year. It selects the closest profitable demand agent and route combination for each supply agent. Like MPFY, this is a greedy algorithm focusing on immediate benefits.\n\n* **SDAY (Shortest Total Distance All Years):** Similar to MPAY, but prioritizes minimizing total distance over the entire simulation time horizon.  It might postpone connections if shorter routes become available later due to infrastructure development.\n\n* **ACAY (Shortest distance to long-haul transport All Years):** Focuses on minimizing capital expenditure by selecting routes with the shortest combined distance for the first and last legs (legs A and C), which typically represent private infrastructure.  Like MPAY and SDAY, this algorithm considers future infrastructure developments.\n\nThese JavaScript examples are highly simplified and would require further development to incorporate the full complexity described in the paper, including detailed cost calculations, capacity constraints, and agent state management within a larger simulation framework.  However, they illustrate the core logic of each algorithm and can serve as a starting point for developers interested in implementing these concepts.  The most important element missing from the provided snippets is the simulation loop and the mechanisms for managing agent states and updating infrastructure over time.",
