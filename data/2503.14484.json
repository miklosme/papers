  "title": "Gricean Norms as a Basis for Effective Collaboration",
  "abstract": "Effective human-AI collaboration hinges not only on the AI agent's ability to follow explicit instructions but also on its capacity to navigate ambiguity, incompleteness, invalidity, and irrelevance in communication. Gricean conversational and inference norms facilitate collaboration by aligning unclear instructions with cooperative principles. We propose a normative framework that integrates Gricean norms and cognitive frameworks—common ground, relevance theory, and theory of mind—into large language model (LLM)-based agents. The normative framework adopts the Gricean maxims of quantity, quality, relation, and manner, along with inference, as Gricean norms to interpret unclear instructions, which are: ambiguous, incomplete, invalid, or irrelevant. Within this framework, we introduce Lamoids, GPT-4 powered agents designed to collaborate with humans. To assess the influence of Gricean norms in human-AI collaboration, we evaluate two versions of a Lamoid: one with norms and one without. In our experiments, a Lamoid collaborates with a human to achieve shared goals in a grid world (Doors, Keys, and Gems) by interpreting both clear and unclear natural language instructions. Our results reveal that the Lamoid with Gricean norms achieves higher task accuracy and generates clearer, more accurate, and contextually relevant responses than the Lamoid without norms. This improvement stems from the normative framework, which enhances the agent's pragmatic reasoning, fostering effective human-AI collaboration and enabling context-aware communication in LLM-based agents.",
  "summary": "This paper explores how to improve human-AI collaboration by teaching AI agents to better understand and respond to unclear natural language instructions.  It proposes a framework that incorporates Gricean norms (rules of conversation like be truthful, relevant, and clear) into LLM-based agents called \"Lamoids.\"\n\nKey points for LLM-based multi-agent systems:\n\n* **Gricean Norms improve instruction interpretation:** Integrating conversational rules helps LLMs discern intent from ambiguous, incomplete, or irrelevant instructions.\n* **Inference norm handles unclear instructions:**  When instructions violate conversational norms, the agent seeks clarification or infers the implied meaning.\n* **Cognitive frameworks enhance context awareness:** Combining Gricean norms with common ground, relevance theory, and theory of mind improves the agent's understanding of the collaborative context.\n* **Few-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting is key:** Providing examples of norm-aligned responses improves LLM performance.\n* **Limitations of LLMs in spatial reasoning:** Challenges remain in applying LLMs to tasks requiring spatial understanding, highlighting the need for specialized tools or hybrid models.\n* **Prompt engineering complexity:** Extensive manual prompt engineering is a current bottleneck.",
  "takeaways": "This research paper provides valuable insights for JavaScript developers working with LLM-based multi-agent systems in web applications. Here are some practical examples applying its concepts:\n\n**1. Building a Collaborative Task Management Application:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine a project management web app where human users and LLM agents collaborate on tasks. Users provide instructions in natural language, and agents perform actions within the app (e.g., creating tasks, assigning deadlines, updating status).\n\n* **Applying Gricean Norms:**  A developer could integrate a \"norm interpretation module\" using a JavaScript library like LangChain. This module, before sending the user's instruction to the LLM, analyzes the instruction against Gricean Maxims.\n    * **Quantity:**  If a user says \"Create a task,\" the module identifies missing information (task name, description, due date) and prompts the user for clarification. This could be implemented using a modal or form in a framework like React or Vue.js.\n    * **Quality:**  If the instruction is \"Assign task X to user Y,\" but user Y doesn't exist, the module flags an error and clarifies with the user.\n    * **Relation:** If an instruction like \"Tell me a joke\" appears, which is irrelevant to task management, the module could respond, \"I'm focused on tasks right now. How can I help with your project?\"\n    * **Manner:** If the instruction is ambiguous (e.g., \"Update the status\"), the module offers clarification options: \"Which task? What status?\" This would be presented as a dropdown or selection list.\n\n* **LLM Integration:** Libraries like LangChain or LlamaIndex provide convenient interfaces for communicating with LLMs. The norm interpretation module would preprocess user input before passing it to the LLM, enhancing the interaction flow.\n\n\n**2. Developing an Interactive Storytelling Platform:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  Users and LLM agents co-create stories. Users provide plot points, characters, and actions, while agents generate narrative, descriptions, and dialogue.\n\n* **Applying Inference and Cognitive Frameworks:** This application could utilize the \"Inference norm\" by incorporating context from the ongoing story. The LLM prompt would include the current story state and characters, allowing it to better understand user instructions, even if they are incomplete. This context management could be done with a JavaScript state management library like Redux or Zustand.\n    * **Common ground:** Store facts about the story that are known to both the user and the agents.\n    * **Relevance theory:** Filter out irrelevant or less important information before it reaches the LLM.\n\n\n**3. Creating a Multi-Agent Game Environment:**\n\n* **Scenario:** A real-time strategy game where human players give high-level instructions to LLM agents controlling units within the game.\n\n* **Practical Implementation in JavaScript:**\n    1. **Client-Side Framework (React/Vue.js):** Handle user input, game UI, and visualization.\n    2. **Server-Side (Node.js):** Manage game logic, agent coordination, and communication with LLMs.\n    3. **LLM Integration:** Use LangChain to process user instructions and generate actions for the agents.\n    4. **Norm Interpretation Module:** Implement a middleware function that analyzes user instructions based on the current game state.  If a norm is violated, request clarification from the user through the UI or infer the intended action.\n\n* **Applying Gricean Norms:** If a player gives the instruction \"Attack,\" the norm module checks which units are available, nearby enemies, and the overall strategic context.  If it needs more information, it asks the player: \"Attack who with what?\" or suggests options based on the current game state.\n\n\n**Key JavaScript Libraries and Frameworks:**\n\n* **LangChain/LlamaIndex:** Simplifies interaction with LLMs.\n* **React/Vue.js/Svelte:** Facilitate UI development for user interaction and data visualization.\n* **Node.js:** Provides the server-side environment for agent coordination and communication.\n* **Redux/Zustand/Context API:** Manage application state and story context.\n\n\n\nBy integrating these principles and leveraging appropriate JavaScript tools, developers can create richer, more robust, and user-friendly LLM-based multi-agent applications. Remember to prioritize clear, concise, and contextually relevant responses from the LLM agents to enhance the collaborative experience.",
