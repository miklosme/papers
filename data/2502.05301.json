  "title": "Decentralized Online Ensembles of Gaussian Processes for Multi-Agent Systems",
  "abstract": "Abstract-Flexible and scalable decentralized learning solutions are fundamentally important in the application of multi-agent systems. While several recent approaches introduce (ensembles of) kernel machines in the distributed setting, Bayesian solutions are much more limited. We introduce a fully decentralized, asymptotically exact solution to computing the random feature approximation of Gaussian processes. We further address the choice of hyperparameters by introducing an ensembling scheme for Bayesian multiple kernel learning based on online Bayesian model averaging. The resulting algorithm is tested against Bayesian and frequentist methods on simulated and real-world datasets.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces a decentralized method for multiple agents to collaboratively learn a complex function (like those modeled by LLMs) without a central server.  Each agent learns locally and shares information with neighbors to build a shared understanding, similar to a gossip protocol. The method uses a computationally efficient approximation of Gaussian Processes (called Random Fourier Features) which makes it suitable for real-time online learning and scalable to many agents.  Further, it employs Bayesian Model Averaging to combine predictions from multiple models with different parameters, enhancing overall prediction accuracy without costly hyperparameter tuning, which is particularly relevant when working with complex LLMs.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents a decentralized approach to training and using Gaussian Processes (GPs), making them scalable for multi-agent systems in web applications. Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights to LLM-based multi-agent projects:\n\n**1. Decentralized LLM Inference:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine a collaborative writing app where multiple users (agents) contribute to a single document. Each user's browser acts as an agent, running a smaller, specialized LLM for tasks like grammar correction, style suggestion, or content generation.\n* **Application:**  Instead of sending all text to a central server for processing by a large LLM, each agent can use a local, smaller LLM. The decentralized GP approach can then combine the outputs of these local LLMs, achieving a result comparable to a central, larger model but with reduced latency and improved privacy.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**  Use a JavaScript LLM library like `transformers.js` or `web-llm`. Implement the consensus algorithm (Eqs. 15 & 16) using a peer-to-peer communication library like `PeerJS` or a serverless function platform for message passing between browser agents.\n\n**2. Ensemble of Specialized LLMs:**\n\n* **Scenario:** A customer service chatbot that handles various inquiries: product information, order status, technical support, etc.\n* **Application:** Train multiple smaller LLMs specializing in different domains. The decentralized ensemble approach allows dynamically selecting the most appropriate LLM based on user input or context. This enables efficient use of resources compared to running one large, general-purpose LLM.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** Use a library like `TensorFlow.js` or `ONNX.js` to load and run different specialized LLM models in the browser. Implement Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) using the update rules (Eqs. 23 & 24) to weight the predictions of different LLMs dynamically, based on previous interactions or the current query.\n\n**3. Collaborative Filtering and Recommendation Systems:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  A movie recommendation website where users rate and review films.\n* **Application:** Each user's browser acts as an agent, learning a personalized recommendation model based on their viewing history.  The decentralized GP framework can then aggregate these individual models without sharing sensitive user data, creating a global recommendation system that benefits all users while respecting privacy.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** Use a client-side machine learning library like `ml5.js` or `brain.js` to train personalized recommendation models in each browser. Implement the decentralized GP algorithm to aggregate these models across users.\n\n**4. Distributed Training of LLMs for Web Applications:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Training a sentiment analysis model on user reviews scattered across multiple websites or databases.\n* **Application:** The paper's insights enable distributed training of smaller LLM models on local data, followed by aggregating them into a single, more powerful model. This avoids the need to transfer large datasets to a central server, reducing bandwidth requirements and enhancing data security.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**  Use a Federated Learning library (e.g., TensorFlow Federated's JavaScript API, if available) or adapt the paper's consensus algorithm to coordinate the training and aggregation of local LLM models using client-side JavaScript and serverless functions.\n\n**Key Considerations for JavaScript Developers:**\n\n* **Computational Resources:** Client-side LLM processing can be resource-intensive. Choose lightweight models and leverage Web Workers for background processing to maintain UI responsiveness.\n* **Communication Overhead:** The consensus algorithm requires communication between agents. Optimize communication frequency and data size to minimize latency.\n* **Security and Privacy:** Design the multi-agent system carefully to prevent malicious agents from influencing the global model or leaking private data.\n* **Library and Framework Choices:** Carefully select appropriate JavaScript libraries for LLM handling, peer-to-peer communication, and numerical computation (e.g., `NumJs`).\n\n\nBy applying these insights and choosing the right tools, JavaScript developers can leverage the power of decentralized and ensemble learning to create innovative LLM-based multi-agent web applications. This approach unlocks new possibilities for building more scalable, efficient, private, and collaborative web experiences.",

It's designed for a multi-agent system where each agent has access to only a portion of the data and communicates with its neighbors to reach a consensus on the model parameters.  The provided JavaScript implementation uses a simplified consensus method and local BMA, but these can be extended with more appropriate methods if required.\n\n\n\n1. **Initialization:** Each agent initializes its local prior precision `D`, information vector `nu`, and model weights. Hyperparameters such as `sigma_0` (prior variance), `lengthscales` (kernel hyperparameters), `sigma_obs` (observation noise), `J` (number of random features), `L` (number of consensus iterations), and `M` (number of ensemble models) are set.\n\n2. **Data Acquisition and Local Computations:** At each time step, each agent receives a new data point (x, y) and computes the local statistics `P_local` and `s_local` based on the random features `phi(x)`. The random features are generated using sampled frequencies from the power spectral density of the chosen kernel (e.g., SE-ARD).\n\n3. **Consensus:** Agents exchange their local statistics with their neighbors and iteratively average them to reach a consensus on the global statistics `P` and `s`. The number of consensus iterations `L` controls the accuracy of the consensus. The implementation provided uses a simplified averaging method; in practice, more robust consensus algorithms (e.g., gossip algorithms) might be preferable.\n\n4. **Posterior Update:** Each agent updates its local posterior precision `D` and information vector `nu` based on the consensus estimates.\n\n5. **Prediction:** For a new input `x`, each agent computes the predictive mean and variance of the target `y` using its local posterior and random features. The ensembling approach calculates a weighted average of predictions from multiple models with different hyperparameters. The weights are updated using Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA), either locally or through an additional consensus step. In the implementation, an example of local BMA is implemented.\n\n6. **Iteration:** Steps 2-5 are repeated for each new data point, enabling online learning and adaptation to changing data distributions.\n\n\nThis decentralized approach allows agents to learn a shared global model without requiring a central server, making it suitable for applications like distributed sensor networks, multi-robot systems, and federated learning. Using random Fourier features makes the algorithm scalable to large datasets, as it avoids the cubic complexity of inverting the full kernel matrix. The ensembling aspect addresses the challenge of hyperparameter tuning in an online setting by maintaining a distribution over different hyperparameter settings.",
