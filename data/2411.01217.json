  "title": "Preference-CFR: Beyond Nash Equilibrium for Better Game Strategies",
  "abstract": "Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have leveraged large-scale games as benchmarks to gauge progress, with AI now frequently outperforming human capabilities. Traditionally, this success has largely relied on solving Nash equilibrium (NE) using variations of the counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) method in games with incomplete information. However, the variety of Nash equilibria has been largely overlooked in previous research, limiting the adaptability of AI to meet diverse human preferences. To address this challenge, where AI is powerful but struggles to meet customization needs, we introduce a novel approach: Preference-CFR, which incorporates two new parameters: preference degree and vulnerability degree. These parameters allow for greater flexibility in AI strategy development without compromising convergence. Our method significantly alters the distribution of final strategies, enabling the creation of customized AI models that better align with individual user needs. Using Texas Hold'em as a case study, our experiments demonstrate how Preference CFR can be adjusted to either emphasize customization, prioritizing user preferences, or to enhance performance, striking a balance between the depth of customization and strategic optimality.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces Preference-CFR (Pref-CFR), an algorithm that extends the Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) algorithm commonly used in game AI. Pref-CFR aims to generate more diverse and customizable AI strategies that go beyond simply achieving Nash Equilibrium (NE). It introduces preference and vulnerability parameters to control the AI's style, allowing developers to create AI agents with distinct characteristics, like aggressive or passive play in poker.  The key points for LLM-based multi-agent systems are that Pref-CFR facilitates creating diverse agent behaviors, going beyond the limitations of standard CFR, which tends to converge to a single, predictable strategy. This diversity and customization could prove invaluable in creating more realistic and engaging multi-agent interactions in web applications leveraging LLMs.  The ability to specify agent preferences opens the door to fine-grained control over agent interactions and potentially new application areas for multi-agent systems in web development.",
  "takeaways": "This paper introduces Preference-CFR (Pref-CFR), an enhancement to the Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) algorithm, designed to create more diverse and customizable AI agents in games. Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights to LLM-based multi-agent projects, particularly in web development:\n\n**1. Customizable Chatbots for E-commerce:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine building a multi-agent system for an e-commerce platform.  Each product has an agent negotiating with a customer's shopping cart agent. Using traditional CFR, these agents might converge on a single, rigid negotiation style (e.g., always offering a small, fixed discount).  Pref-CFR allows for more nuanced agent behaviors.\n* **Implementation:**  You could use a JavaScript LLM library like `LangChain.js` or `transformers.js` to power the language component of the agents. The preference degree (`δ`) could be adjusted based on product type, inventory levels, or even customer browsing history.  For example, an agent for a high-demand item could have a higher `δ` for holding firm on price, while an agent for a clearance item might have a higher `δ` for offering larger discounts. This logic can be implemented directly in JavaScript, updating the `δ` values dynamically.\n* **Framework:** A framework like `Node.js` with `Socket.IO` could handle real-time communication between the agents within the web application.\n\n**2. Interactive Storytelling and Game Development:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Develop a multi-agent storytelling platform where user actions influence the narrative direction.  Each character in the story is represented by an agent. Instead of predictable character arcs, Pref-CFR allows for more flexible and surprising narrative developments.\n* **Implementation:** LLMs can handle character dialogue and actions. The preference parameters can control the personality and behavior of each character.  A higher `δ` for \"aggressiveness\" might lead a character to take risks or initiate conflict, while a higher `δ` for \"cooperation\" might encourage alliance-building behaviors. JavaScript event listeners can capture user actions and update the preference parameters accordingly.\n* **Library:** `Phaser.js` or `Babylon.js` could handle the visual representation of the game or story, integrated with the AI logic running in the background.\n\n**3. Collaborative Design Tools:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Create a collaborative design platform for websites or other digital artifacts. Multiple agents represent different design aspects (e.g., layout, color scheme, typography).  Pref-CFR enables the agents to explore a wider range of design possibilities based on user input and preferences.\n* **Implementation:**  LLMs could generate design suggestions or evaluate existing designs based on aesthetic principles. The preference parameters could be tied to user-defined design preferences (e.g., minimalist, colorful, modern). JavaScript libraries like `D3.js` could be used to visualize the designs and allow for user interaction and feedback.\n\n**4. Dynamic Resource Allocation in Web Applications:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  Manage resources (bandwidth, server load, etc.) in a complex web application. Each service in the application has an agent negotiating for resources.  Pref-CFR allows for more adaptable resource allocation strategies that consider both efficiency and fairness.\n* **Implementation:**  Real-time monitoring tools can provide input to the agents about current resource usage.  The preference parameters can be dynamically adjusted based on application needs and priorities. A higher `δ` for \"fairness\" might ensure that all services receive a minimum level of resources, while a higher `δ` for \"efficiency\" might prioritize critical services.\n\n**Key JavaScript Considerations:**\n\n* **Data Structures:** Efficiently store and manage the agent states, preference parameters, and game history. Consider using JavaScript objects or arrays, potentially combined with libraries for optimized data manipulation.\n* **Asynchronous Programming:** Handle the concurrent operations of multiple agents using `async/await` and promises for efficient communication and coordination.\n* **Visualization:**  Use charting libraries like `Chart.js` or `Highcharts` to visualize agent behaviors and analyze the impact of different preference parameter settings.\n\nBy incorporating the concepts of Pref-CFR, JavaScript developers can create more dynamic, adaptable, and human-like agents that significantly enhance the user experience in various web applications.  The key is to carefully map the theoretical concepts of preference and vulnerability degrees to specific application needs and design parameters in your JavaScript code. Remember that experimentation and iterative development will be essential to finding the optimal settings for your particular application.",
  "pseudocode": "The paper contains mathematical formulas describing the algorithms, but they are not presented in a pseudocode style easily translatable to JavaScript.  The algorithms rely heavily on concepts of game theory (regret minimization, best response, etc.) and are tightly coupled to the structure of imperfect information games.  A direct, line-by-line translation wouldn't be meaningful without a larger supporting framework.\n\nHowever, I can offer conceptual JavaScript implementations of the core ideas and how they modify the standard Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) algorithm. This will provide a starting point for JavaScript developers interested in experimenting with these concepts.\n\n**Conceptual JavaScript Implementation of Preference-CFR (Pref-CFR)**\n\n```javascript\nclass PrefCFR {\n  constructor(game, preferenceDegrees, vulnerabilityDegrees = null) {\n    this.game = game; // Assume 'game' object provides game logic\n    this.preferenceDegrees = preferenceDegrees; // Object mapping infoSets to preference degree vectors\n    this.vulnerabilityDegrees = vulnerabilityDegrees; // Object mapping infoSets to vulnerability degrees\n    this.regrets = {};  // Initialize regrets to zero for each infoSet and action\n    this.strategySum = {}; // Initialize strategy sum to zero for each infoSet and action\n  }\n\n\n  train(iterations) {\n    for (let i = 0; i < iterations; i++) {\n      this.traverse(this.game.root, 1, 1);\n    }\n  }\n\n  traverse(node, reachProb1, reachProb2) {\n    if (this.game.isTerminal(node)) {\n      return this.game.getPayoff(node); // Return payoff at terminal node\n    }\n\n    let infoSet = this.game.getInfoSet(node);\n    let currentPlayer = this.game.getPlayer(node);\n\n    if (!(infoSet in this.regrets)) {\n      this.regrets[infoSet] = Array(this.game.getNumActions(infoSet)).fill(0);\n      this.strategySum[infoSet] = Array(this.game.getNumActions(infoSet)).fill(0);\n    }\n\n    let strategy = this.getStrategy(infoSet);\n    let util = Array(this.game.getNumActions(infoSet)).fill(0);\n    let nodeUtil = 0;\n\n\n    for (let action = 0; action < this.game.getNumActions(infoSet); action++) {\n      let newReachProb1 = currentPlayer === 1 ? reachProb1 * strategy[action] : reachProb1;\n      let newReachProb2 = currentPlayer === 2 ? reachProb2 * strategy[action] : reachProb2;\n\n      util[action] = this.traverse(this.game.getNextState(node, action), newReachProb1, newReachProb2);\n      nodeUtil += strategy[action] * util[action];\n    }\n\n    if (currentPlayer !== 0) { // 0 represents chance node\n      for (let action = 0; action < this.game.getNumActions(infoSet); action++) {\n        let regret = util[action] - nodeUtil;\n        this.regrets[infoSet][action] += (currentPlayer === 1 ? reachProb2 : reachProb1) * regret;\n      }\n    }\n\n      let currentStrategy = this.getStrategy(infoSet);\n      for (let action = 0; action < this.game.getNumActions(infoSet); action++){\n          this.strategySum[infoSet][action] += (currentPlayer === 1 ? reachProb1 : reachProb2 )* currentStrategy[action];\n      }\n\n    return nodeUtil;\n  }\n\n  getStrategy(infoSet) {\n      let normalizingSum = 0;\n      let strategy = this.regrets[infoSet].map((x) => Math.max(0, x) * (this.preferenceDegrees[infoSet] || 1));\n\n      let strategySum = 0\n      for (let a = 0; a < strategy.length; a++){\n          strategySum += strategy[a];\n      }\n\n      if (strategySum > 0) {\n          return strategy.map(x => x / strategySum);\n      } else {\n          return Array(this.game.getNumActions(infoSet)).fill(1 / this.game.getNumActions(infoSet));\n      }\n  }\n\n  getAverageStrategy() {\n      let avgStrategy = {};\n      for (let infoSet in this.strategySum){\n          let normalizingSum = this.strategySum[infoSet].reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);\n          if (normalizingSum > 0){\n              avgStrategy[infoSet] = this.strategySum[infoSet].map(x => x/normalizingSum);\n          } else {\n              avgStrategy[infoSet] = Array(this.game.getNumActions(infoSet)).fill(1/this.game.getNumActions(infoSet))\n          }\n\n      }\n      return avgStrategy;\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n// Example Usage (Conceptual)\nconst game = { /* Your game logic here */ };\nconst preferenceDegrees = {\n  \"infoSet1\": [1, 2],  // Prefer the second action in \"infoSet1\"\n  \"infoSet2\": [1, 1, 1] // No preference in \"infoSet2\"\n};\nconst vulnerabilityDegrees = {/* Example: {\"infoSet1\": 0.05} */};\n\n\nconst cfrTrainer = new PrefCFR(game, preferenceDegrees, vulnerabilityDegrees);\ncfrTrainer.train(10000);\nconst averageStrategy = cfrTrainer.getAverageStrategy();\nconsole.log(averageStrategy);\n```\n\n\n**Explanation and Purpose:**\n\n* **`PrefCFR` Class:** This encapsulates the Pref-CFR algorithm.  It takes the game, preference degrees (`δ`), and optionally vulnerability degrees (`β`) as constructor arguments.\n* **`train()` Method:**  Runs the CFR algorithm for a specified number of iterations.\n* **`traverse()` Method:** Recursively traverses the game tree, updating regrets. This method incorporates the reach probabilities and adjusts based on the current player.\n* **`getStrategy()` Method:**  Calculates the current strategy based on regrets, incorporating the preference degrees (`δ`).  If vulnerability degrees (`β`) are provided, the regret is adjusted accordingly.  This is where the core logic of Pref-CFR resides.\n* **`getAverageStrategy()` Method:** Returns the average strategy over all iterations, a crucial output of CFR.\n\n\n**Key Improvements over Standard CFR:**\n\n* **Preference Degrees:** The `getStrategy()` method now multiplies the positive regrets by the corresponding preference degree, thus biasing the strategy towards preferred actions.\n* **Vulnerability Degrees:**  Although not fully implemented in this simplified example, the concept would involve subtracting the vulnerability degree from the regret before calculating the strategy, allowing for a controllable deviation from a strict Nash Equilibrium.\n\n\nThis JavaScript implementation provides a conceptual framework. A fully functional version would require a well-defined game object and appropriate integration of the vulnerability degrees into the strategy calculation. It serves as a starting point for JavaScript developers who wish to explore and experiment with the Pref-CFR algorithm. Remember, this is a simplified demonstration and might require adjustments based on the specific needs of your multi-agent web application.",
