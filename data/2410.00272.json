  "title": "Decentralized Input and State Estimation for Multi-agent System with Dynamic Topology and Heterogeneous Sensor Network",
  "abstract": "Abstract-A crucial challenge in decentralized systems is state estimation in the presence of unknown inputs, particularly within heterogeneous sensor networks with dynamic topologies. While numerous consensus algorithms have been introduced, they often require extensive information exchange or multiple communication iterations to ensure estimation accuracy. This paper proposes an efficient algorithm that achieves an unbiased and optimal solution comparable to filters with full information about other agents. This is accomplished through the use of information filter decomposition and the fusion of inputs via covariance intersection. Our method requires only a single communication iteration for exchanging individual estimates between agents, instead of multiple rounds of information exchange, thus preserving agents' privacy by avoiding the sharing of explicit observations and system equations. Furthermore, to address the challenges posed by dynamic communication topologies, we propose two practical strategies to handle issues arising from intermittent observations and incomplete state estimation, thereby enhancing the robustness and accuracy of the estimation process. Experiments and ablation studies conducted in both stationary and dynamic environments demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm over other baselines. Notably, it performs as well as, or even better than, algorithms that have a global view of all neighbors.",
  "summary": "This paper presents a novel algorithm for decentralized input and state estimation in multi-agent AI systems, particularly useful for scenarios like sensor networks. It allows agents to achieve near-optimal estimations by exchanging only intermediate estimations with their direct neighbors, instead of requiring full knowledge of the entire system or raw data from all agents. \n\nThis approach is relevant to LLM-based multi-agent systems as it offers: \n\n* **Privacy:** Agents don't expose raw data or internal model parameters, preserving privacy.\n* **Scalability:** The algorithm performs efficiently in dynamic networks with limited communication bandwidth.\n* **Robustness:** It handles intermittent observations and unknown inputs affecting system dynamics.",
  "takeaways": "This paper outlines a novel approach to decentralized input and state estimation in multi-agent systems, particularly useful for JavaScript developers working with LLM-based agents in web applications. Here's how you can apply these insights:\n\n**Scenario: Collaborative Content Creation**\n\nImagine building a collaborative writing app where multiple users (agents) simultaneously edit a document. Each agent, powered by an LLM, suggests text modifications based on its local context and user input.\n\n**Challenges:**\n\n* **Conflicting Edits:** LLMs working in isolation might propose conflicting changes to the document.\n* **Bandwidth Limitations:** Transmitting the entire document state and LLM outputs for every modification is impractical.\n\n**Applying the Paper's Insights:**\n\n1. **Decentralized Input Estimation:**\n    * Each agent, using its LLM, estimates the \"input\" â€“ the intended modification to the document based on user actions and its local context.\n    * Instead of sharing raw edits, agents share these \"input estimations\" (e.g., \"insert word 'amazing' after position 10\", \"delete characters 25-27\")  and their associated confidence scores (covariances).\n    * This minimizes bandwidth consumption as you're sharing concise instructions instead of large text chunks.\n\n2. **Covariance Intersection for Input Fusion:**\n    * Implement the covariance intersection algorithm (CI) to merge input estimations from different agents. CI is particularly useful when the correlations between agents' estimations are unknown.\n    * JavaScript libraries like  [NumJs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/numjs) can be used to handle the matrix operations involved in CI.\n\n3. **State Fusion with Information Filter Decomposition:**\n    * Use the information filter decomposition approach to efficiently combine individual agent's state estimations into a globally consistent document state. This avoids the need for iterative consensus algorithms, further reducing communication overhead.\n\n4. **Handling Intermittent Connectivity:**\n    * The paper addresses challenges with dynamic network topologies, where agents might have intermittent connectivity.\n    * Implement the \"observation time window\" mechanism to ensure your system remains robust even if some agents temporarily disconnect.\n\n**JavaScript Implementation:**\n\nYou can implement these concepts using Node.js for the backend and a framework like React or Vue.js for the frontend.  \n\n* **Backend (Node.js):**  Handle agent communication, input/state estimation logic, and covariance calculations using libraries like NumJs.\n* **Frontend (React/Vue.js):**  Manage user interactions, display the dynamically updated document, and visualize agent estimations.\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n* **Reduced Latency:** Faster updates due to efficient information exchange.\n* **Scalability:** Handles more simultaneous users due to reduced communication overhead.\n* **Privacy:**  Sharing estimations instead of raw data enhances privacy.\n\nThis is just one example. The paper's insights can be applied to various LLM-based multi-agent web applications, including:\n\n* **Multiplayer Games:** Decentralized decision-making for game AI.\n* **Collaborative Design Tools:** Real-time, collaborative editing of designs.\n* **Social Media Platforms:**  Distributed content filtering and recommendation systems.",

Here's a breakdown:\n\n* **DISKF Function:** The core algorithm for decentralized input and state estimation.\n    * **Inputs:** System matrices (A, G, H, Q, R), list of neighbors for communication.\n    * **Outputs:** Fused state (x), input (d), and their respective covariances (P, S).\n* **Initialization:**  Sets initial values for state (x), input (d), and their covariances (P, S). Also defines the observation time window, a critical parameter for handling intermittent observations in dynamic settings.\n* **Individual Estimation:** Each agent independently performs:\n    * **Prediction:** Predicts the next state (xPredicted) and covariance (PPredicted) based on the system dynamics.\n    * **Input Estimation:** Estimates unknown input (d) using a helper function (`estimateInput`), but only if the time elapsed since the last observation is within the defined `observationWindow`.\n    * **State Update:** Updates the state (x) and covariance (P) using the standard Kalman Filter equations, but crucially, without incorporating the input estimation in this step. This choice simplifies the algorithm while maintaining accuracy. \n* **Communication:**  Agents exchange their estimated input (d), state (x), and corresponding covariances (S, P) with their immediate neighbors, as defined by the `neighbors` input.\n* **Input Fusion:**  Agents fuse the received input estimations from their neighbors using the Covariance Intersection method. This method is robust to unknown correlations between estimates, a common challenge in decentralized systems.\n* **State Fusion:** Agents fuse their state estimates using the Information Filter Decomposition method. This approach, rooted in information theory, ensures that the fused estimate and its covariance are equivalent to a hypothetical central agent having access to all observations. \n* **State Compensation:**  For dynamic topologies (where communication links change), an additional state compensation step is introduced. This step helps mitigate estimation errors arising from network dynamics and limited communication.\n* **Helper Functions:**  The code also indicates the need for helper functions to implement:\n    * `estimateInput`: Calculates the unknown input (d).\n    * **Covariance Intersection:**  Implements the input fusion logic.\n    * **Information Filter Decomposition:** Implements the state fusion logic.\n    * **State Compensation:** Implements the additional adjustment for dynamic topologies.\n\n**Purpose:**\n\nThis algorithm aims to provide a decentralized and robust solution for estimating both the state and unknown inputs of a system using a network of agents with limited communication and potentially intermittent observations. This has significant applications in areas such as robotics, sensor networks, and distributed control systems.",
