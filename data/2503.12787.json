  "title": "Energy-Aware Task Allocation for Teams of Multi-mode Robots",
  "abstract": "Abstract-This work proposes a novel multi-robot task allocation framework for robots that can switch between multiple modes, e.g., flying, driving, or walking. We first provide a method to encode the multi-mode property of robots as a graph, where the mode of each robot is represented by a node. Next, we formulate a constrained optimization problem to decide both the task to be allocated to each robot as well as the mode in which the latter should execute the task. The robot modes are optimized based on the state of the robot and the environment, as well as the energy required to execute the allocated task. The robot modes are optimized based on the state of the robot and the environment, as well as the energy required to execute the allocated task. Moreover, the proposed framework is able to encompass kinematic and dynamic models of robots alike. Furthermore, we provide sufficient conditions for the convergence of task execution and allocation for both robot models.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces a new way to assign tasks to a team of robots that can switch between different modes (like flying, driving, or walking).  It aims to optimize task completion while minimizing energy consumption, considering each mode's capabilities and energy efficiency.  The system uses an optimization algorithm and a constraint-based method to ensure robots select the best mode for a given task and avoid conflicts.\n\nRelevant to LLM-based multi-agent systems, the paper demonstrates:\n    * A formal model for representing agent capabilities and modes, translatable to LLM agent prompts and contexts.\n    * A prioritization scheme for task allocation and mode switching that can be adapted to LLM agents based on prompt complexity, context length, or inference cost.\n    * A method for handling constraints and optimizing for multiple objectives, applicable to LLM-based agents with diverse capabilities and resource limitations.\n    * A theoretical framework for analyzing system stability and convergence, potentially adaptable for evaluating the behavior of multi-agent LLM systems.",
  "takeaways": "This research paper on energy-aware task allocation for multi-mode robots offers valuable insights for JavaScript developers building LLM-based multi-agent applications, particularly in web development scenarios. Here’s how a JavaScript developer can apply the concepts:\n\n**1. Modeling Multi-Mode Agents with LLMs:**\n\n* **Agent Capabilities and Modes:**  Imagine a customer service web application with multiple LLM-based agents. Each agent can have different \"modes\" – e.g., a \"sales\" mode focused on product promotion, a \"support\" mode specializing in technical assistance, or a \"general\" mode handling basic inquiries.  These modes can be represented as different prompts, fine-tuned models, or context injected into the LLM.  The paper's concept of  \"virtual robots\" maps well to these specialized LLM instances.\n* **JavaScript Representation:**  You could use a JavaScript class structure to define your agents, with properties representing their capabilities and current mode.  For example:\n\n```javascript\nclass LLMAgent {\n  constructor(name, capabilities, initialMode) {\n    this.name = name;\n    this.capabilities = capabilities; // [\"sales\", \"support\"]\n    this.mode = initialMode; // \"general\"\n    this.llm = new LLM(...); // Initialize your LLM instance\n  }\n\n  switchMode(newMode) {\n    this.mode = newMode; \n    // Update LLM prompt/context based on the new mode\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**2. Task Allocation and Prioritization:**\n\n* **Dynamic Task Assignment:** When a user request arrives (e.g., a chat message), the web application needs to decide which agent is best suited to handle it. The paper's optimization problem can be adapted to this scenario.  The \"cost\" function could consider factors like agent availability, the estimated energy/compute cost of the LLM, and the agent's specialization (mode).\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** You could use libraries like Langchain.js to manage your LLM interactions and build a task allocation system.  For example:\n\n```javascript\nfunction allocateTask(task) {\n  let bestAgent = null;\n  let minCost = Infinity;\n\n  for (const agent of agents) {\n    const cost = calculateCost(agent, task); // Consider capabilities, mode, load\n    if (cost < minCost) {\n      minCost = cost;\n      bestAgent = agent;\n    }\n  }\n  bestAgent.switchMode(getBestModeForTask(bestAgent, task));\n  return bestAgent;\n}\n```\n\n**3. Energy/Cost Optimization:**\n\n* **LLM Inference Cost:** LLM calls can be expensive. The paper's focus on energy consumption translates directly to optimizing the cost of LLM inference in a web application.  You could track the cost of different LLM prompts/models in various modes and use this data to inform your task allocation strategy.\n* **Prioritization Logic:** The paper's prioritization mechanisms (equations 6a and 6b) can be adapted to prioritize low-cost modes for an agent when multiple modes could handle a task.\n\n**4. Resiliency and Scalability:**\n\n* **Agent Failover:** If an LLM-based agent becomes unavailable (e.g., API errors), the task allocation system should be able to reassign the task to another agent seamlessly. The paper's multi-agent framework provides a robust foundation for this.\n* **Scaling with User Load:**  As the number of users increases, the system should be able to scale by adding more agents or switching agents to more efficient modes.  This can be implemented using serverless functions or containerized deployments.\n\n**5. Experimentation and Libraries:**\n\n* **Langchain.js:**  Use Langchain.js for managing LLM interactions, chains, and agents.  This library can also be used to implement custom logic for task allocation.\n* **Node.js with clustering/worker threads:** Use Node.js with clustering or worker threads to manage multiple LLM agent instances and distribute workload.\n\n\nBy adapting the concepts from this paper and utilizing JavaScript tools and frameworks, developers can create more efficient, resilient, and scalable LLM-based multi-agent applications for the web.  The examples above illustrate a starting point, and the specific implementation will depend on the complexity and requirements of the project.  The key takeaway is to think about your LLMs as \"multi-mode agents\" with different capabilities and associated costs.",
  "pseudocode": "No pseudocode block found. However, the paper presents mathematical formulations for multi-robot task allocation and execution, particularly optimization problems (3) and (5), that could be translated into JavaScript using optimization libraries.  While not pseudocode, these form the core algorithms of the approach.\n\nHere's a conceptual outline of how you might approach translating these formulations to JavaScript:\n\n**1. Optimization Problem Setup:**\n\nYou'd use a JavaScript optimization library like `math.js` or a more specialized numerical optimization library. These libraries often require you to define the objective function and constraints in a specific format.\n\n**2. Objective Function (5a):**\n\nThis involves calculating a weighted sum of penalties, energy costs, and slack variables.  You would define JavaScript functions to calculate each of these components based on the current state of the robots, tasks, and their assigned modes.\n\n**3. Constraints (5b-5h):**\n\n* **Task Execution (5b & 16):**  These constraints ensure task completion. For high-relative degree tasks, you would implement the integral CBF condition (16). This would involve calculating derivatives and Lie derivatives, which can be done numerically using libraries like `math.js`.\n* **Mode/Task Prioritization (5c & 6):** You would implement the prioritization constraints using inequalities based on the slack variables and a prioritization parameter (`κ`).\n* **Allocation Constraints (5d-5h):** These constraints limit the number of tasks per robot, ensure feasibility, and define the range of allowed robots per task. These would be translated directly into constraints for the optimization problem.\n\n**4. Solving the Optimization Problem:**\n\nThe chosen JavaScript library would provide functions to solve the defined optimization problem. This would return the optimal allocation matrix (`α`) and control inputs (`Ui,k`) for each robot and mode.\n\n\n**Example (Simplified Task Execution - Equation 3):**\n\n```javascript\nimport * as math from 'mathjs';\n\n// Example: Simple energy cost function (replace with paper's version)\nfunction energyCost(u) {\n  return math.norm(u);\n}\n\n// Example: Simple CBF constraint (replace with paper's version)\nfunction cbfConstraint(x, u) {\n  // ... calculate Lfh(x), Lgh(x) ...\n  return Lfh_x + math.multiply(Lgh_x, u); \n}\n\n// Example: Optimization for a single task and robot (simplified)\nfunction optimizeControl(x, gamma, h) {\n\n  const objective = (u) => energyCost(u) + math.square(delta);\n\n  const constraints = [\n    { type: 'ineq', fun: (u) => cbfConstraint(x,u) + gamma * h(x) + delta } // eq.3\n  ];\n\n\n  const result = math.optimize(objective, constraints, {});\n\n  return result.x; // Optimal control input u\n}\n\n\n```\n\nThis example provides a very basic illustration. The actual implementation would be significantly more complex, encompassing multi-robot and multi-task scenarios, mode switching logic, and the complex energy and CBF constraints described in the paper.  It would also require integration with a robotics framework for control and simulation.  Consider this a starting point for understanding how the mathematical formulations could be translated to a practical JavaScript implementation.",
