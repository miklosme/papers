  "title": "Exploring Generative AI Techniques in Government: A Case Study",
  "abstract": "Abstract-The swift progress of Generative Artificial intelligence (GenAI), notably Large Language Models (LLMs), is reshaping the digital landscape. Recognizing this transformative potential, the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) launched a pilot initiative to explore the integration of GenAI techniques into its daily operation for performance excellence, where 22 projects were launched in May 2024. Within these projects, this paper presents the development of the intelligent agent Pubbie as a case study, targeting the automation of performance measurement, data management and insight reporting at the NRC. Cutting-edge techniques are explored, including LLM orchestration and semantic embedding via RoBERTa, while strategic fine-tuning and few-shot learning approaches are incorporated to infuse domain knowledge at an affordable cost. The user-friendly interface of Pubbie allows general government users to input queries in natural language and easily upload or download files with a simple button click, greatly reducing manual efforts and accessibility barriers.",
  "summary": "This paper details the development of Pubbie, an intelligent agent using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate tasks within the National Research Council of Canada (NRC), specifically linking research publications to NRC funding programs and answering user queries about these publications.\n\nKey points for LLM-based multi-agent systems:\n\n* **LLM Orchestration:**  Pubbie utilizes multiple LLMs coordinated through Semantic Kernel to handle different sub-tasks like query classification, database interaction, and response generation.\n* **Few-Shot Learning with Prompt Templates:** Domain-specific knowledge is injected into the LLMs via prompt templates and few-shot learning examples, improving accuracy and context-awareness.\n* **Integration with External Databases:** Pubbie overcomes LLM input length limitations by integrating an SQLite database to store and retrieve publication data, enabling querying and updating through natural language.\n* **User-Friendly Interface:**  A Streamlit-based interface allows non-technical users to interact with the system easily via natural language and simple file uploads/downloads.\n* **Cost-Effective Solution:** Pubbie is designed to operate within a resource-constrained environment, utilizing affordable computing resources and minimizing the need for specialized technical expertise.\n* **Collaborative Development Model:** The project highlights a collaborative approach involving students, business process owners, and researchers, fostering innovation and shared problem-solving.",
  "takeaways": "This paper details the creation of Pubbie, an LLM-powered intelligent agent for automating tasks within a government organization. Here's how JavaScript developers can apply these insights to their own LLM-based multi-agent projects:\n\n**1. LLM Orchestration and Specialized Agents:**\n\n* **Concept:** Pubbie uses different LLMs for distinct subtasks (categorizing user input, generating SQL, formulating responses). This specialization improves efficiency and allows leveraging the strengths of different LLMs.  In a web app, this could involve one agent specializing in user interaction, another in data retrieval, and another in generating visual outputs.\n* **JavaScript Application:**  Consider using a message broker (like Redis or RabbitMQ) with Node.js to coordinate communication between specialized agent modules. Each module can interact with a different LLM API (e.g., OpenAI, Cohere, Hugging Face) via a dedicated JavaScript library like `openai` or `langchain`.\n\n```javascript\n// Example using Langchain and a message broker (conceptual):\n\n// User Interaction Agent\nconst { OpenAI } = require(\"langchain/llms/openai\");\nconst llm = new OpenAI({ temperature: 0 });\n// ... (receive message from broker, process user input, send to other agents)\n\n\n// Data Retrieval Agent\n// ... (receive message from broker, query database/API, send results to other agents)\n\n// Response Generation Agent\n// ... (receive message from broker, generate response with LLM, send to User Interaction Agent)\n\n```\n\n**2. Few-Shot Learning and Prompt Engineering:**\n\n* **Concept:** Pubbie utilizes prompt templates and domain-specific data for few-shot learning to enhance LLM accuracy in a specific domain.\n* **JavaScript Application:** Create JavaScript functions to dynamically generate prompts incorporating user context and domain knowledge before sending them to the LLM API.  Store and manage these prompts in a database or configuration file.\n\n```javascript\n// Example Prompt Template Function:\nfunction generateSQLPrompt(userQuery, tableName) {\n    return `Convert the following user query into a SQL query for the table '${tableName}':\n    User Query: ${userQuery}\n    SQL Query:`;\n}\n\n\n// Example usage with the OpenAI API:\nconst prompt = generateSQLPrompt(\"Get all publications from 2023\", \"publications\");\nconst response = await openai.createCompletion({\n    model: \"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n    prompt: prompt,\n});\n\nconst sqlQuery = response.data.choices[0].text.trim();\n```\n\n\n**3. Database Integration for Context and Data Management:**\n\n* **Concept:** Pubbie overcomes LLM input size limitations by using a SQLite database. This allows agents to access and process larger datasets and maintain context.\n* **JavaScript Application:** Use Node.js with a database library (e.g., `sqlite3`, `knex`) to interact with a database (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL) for storing domain data and agent-generated content.\n\n```javascript\n// Example using sqlite3:\nconst sqlite3 = require('sqlite3').verbose();\nconst db = new sqlite3.Database('agent_data.db');\n\ndb.all(`SELECT * FROM publications WHERE year = 2023`, [], (err, rows) => {\n    if (err) {\n        throw err;\n    }\n    // Process retrieved publications\n});\n\n\n```\n\n**4. User Interface and Interaction:**\n\n* **Concept:** Pubbie has a simple, user-friendly interface (built with Streamlit in the paper). This facilitates user interaction and accessibility.\n* **JavaScript Application:** Utilize JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue, or Svelte to build interactive web interfaces for multi-agent applications. Design clear interaction patterns for user queries, file uploads/downloads, and agent responses.\n\n**5. Semantic Embeddings (RoBERTa/BERT):**\n\n* **Concept:** Pubbie uses RoBERTa for semantic understanding and classification.\n* **JavaScript Application:** Use a JavaScript library like `transformers.js`  or a cloud-based API (e.g., Hugging Face Inference API) to generate and utilize embeddings within your JavaScript code. Pre-compute and store embeddings in a vector database (like Pinecone, Weaviate) for efficient similarity search and retrieval.\n\n\nBy combining these concepts and leveraging the flexibility of JavaScript and its rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, developers can build robust and practical multi-agent web applications inspired by Pubbie's design principles.
