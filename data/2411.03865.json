  "title": "AdaSociety: An Adaptive Environment with Social Structures for Multi-Agent Decision-Making",
  "abstract": "Traditional interactive environments limit agents' intelligence growth with fixed tasks. Recently, single-agent environments address this by generating new tasks based on agent actions, enhancing task diversity. We consider the decision-making problem in multi-agent settings, where tasks are further influenced by social connections, affecting rewards and information access. However, existing multi-agent environments lack a combination of adaptive physical surroundings and social connections, hindering the learning of intelligent behaviors. To address this, we introduce AdaSociety, a customizable multi-agent environment featuring expanding state and action spaces, alongside explicit and alterable social structures. As agents progress, the environment adaptively generates new tasks with social structures for agents to undertake. In AdaSociety, we develop three mini-games showcasing distinct social structures and tasks. Initial results demonstrate that specific social structures can promote both individual and collective benefits, though current reinforcement learning and LLM-based algorithms show limited effectiveness in leveraging social structures to enhance performance. Overall, AdaSociety serves as a valuable research platform for exploring intelligence in diverse physical and social settings. The code is available at https://github.com/bigai-ai/AdaSociety.",
  "summary": "1. AdaSociety is a new customizable multi-agent environment that creates complex, evolving tasks by expanding the game world and changing social connections between agents during gameplay.  This contrasts with traditional environments that have fixed tasks and world settings, limiting agent learning.  The researchers tested existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Large Language Model (LLM) agents and found current methods struggle to leverage these dynamic social structures and changing environments.\n\n2.  AdaSociety introduces explicit social structures (represented as graphs) that influence reward and information access for agents. It allows for dynamic connections where agents can join and leave groups, mimicking realistic social dynamics. This social layer is key for research on LLM-based multi-agent systems because it demands cooperation, negotiation, and adaptation to other agents' actions, all crucial aspects of social intelligence.  Initial tests with an LLM-based agent (LLM-C) leveraging GPT-4 showed promising results, outperforming most tested RL methods.  The LLM-C combined high-level planning from the LLM with a rule-based controller for execution.  This suggests LLMs might be well-suited for navigating complex social dynamics and adapting to evolving game worlds.  However, LLM limitations like hallucination and context length were also observed, highlighting areas for further research.  A curriculum learning approach was also explored for RL agents to improve their adaptability.",
  "takeaways": "This paper introduces AdaSociety, a multi-agent environment with dynamic social structures and expanding game spaces. Here are practical examples illustrating how JavaScript developers can apply these insights to LLM-based multi-agent AI projects in web development:\n\n**1. Dynamic Social Networks in Collaborative Web Apps:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  Imagine building a collaborative project management web app.  Users (agents) have different roles and permissions, and their interactions (social connections) influence project progress and resource allocation.\n* **AdaSociety Insight:** The dynamic social structure in AdaSociety translates to a dynamically changing network graph of users in your web app.  As users join/leave teams, change roles, or complete tasks, the graph structure updates.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * **Frontend:** Use a graph visualization library like `vis.js` or `Cytoscape.js` to represent the user network.  Dynamically update the graph nodes and edges based on user actions (e.g., joining a team) using websockets or server-sent events.\n    * **Backend:** Store the social graph data in a database (e.g., Neo4j for graph databases, or MongoDB/PostgreSQL with appropriate schema). Expose APIs to update the graph and fetch data for visualization.\n    * **LLM Integration:** Use an LLM to analyze the social graph (e.g., identify central users, predict potential bottlenecks) and provide insights to users. Use LangChain or LlamaIndex for easier LLM integration.\n\n\n**2. Adaptive User Interfaces using LLMs:**\n\n* **Scenario:** An e-learning platform where the user interface adapts to the learner's progress and social interactions (e.g., forum discussions, peer reviews).\n* **AdaSociety Insight:** AdaSociety's expanding game space inspires the creation of an adaptive UI that unlocks new features and content as the learner progresses and interacts with others.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * **Frontend:** Use a framework like React or Vue.js to manage the UI state.  Dynamically render UI components based on the learner's progress and social interactions. For example, unlock new modules, display relevant forum discussions, or suggest peer review partners based on learner’s interactions, all driven by LLM analysis.\n    * **Backend:**  Store learner data and social interactions in a database.  Develop algorithms and APIs (potentially LLM-powered) to determine what UI elements to show based on the learner's current state and the overall social context.\n    * **LLM Integration:** The LLM could be used to personalize the learning experience by analyzing learner interactions and suggesting relevant content, learning resources, or collaborative opportunities with other learners.\n\n\n\n**3. Multi-Agent Simulations in Web-Based Games:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  A web-based strategy game where players control multiple units (agents) that interact and cooperate to achieve objectives.\n* **AdaSociety Insight:** Implement a simplified version of AdaSociety's physical and social components.  The game map is the physical space, and players can form alliances (social connections) that influence their units' actions and rewards.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * **Frontend:**  Use a game engine like Phaser or Babylon.js to render the game world and handle user input.  Implement the multi-agent logic in JavaScript, drawing inspiration from the AdaSociety's Growing-MG formulation.\n    * **Backend:** Handle game state synchronization and player communication using Node.js and websockets. Use a queue system (e.g., Redis, RabbitMQ) for handling actions.\n    * **LLM Integration:**  Enhance bot behavior by using an LLM to generate strategic plans based on the current game state and social connections. Fine-tune a smaller LLM for faster inference directly on the client.\n\n\n**4. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) in Web3:**\n\n* **Scenario:** A DAO managing a community-owned online platform. Members (agents) propose and vote on platform improvements, and their voting power (influence) depends on their social standing within the DAO.\n* **AdaSociety Insight:** Model the DAO's governance system using AdaSociety's multi-layer graph representation of social structure. Different layers could represent different roles within the DAO (e.g., members, moderators, administrators).\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * **Frontend:** Use a library like ethers.js to interact with the DAO's smart contracts. Visualize the DAO's social structure and voting power dynamics using a graph visualization library.\n    * **Backend:**  Develop backend services (using Node.js or other frameworks) to manage user accounts, track their social interactions within the DAO, and calculate their voting power.\n    * **LLM Integration:**  Use an LLM to analyze proposals, summarize discussions, and provide insights to DAO members to help them make informed voting decisions. This can also be applied to DAO operation automation (e.g., treasury management).\n\nThese are just a few examples. AdaSociety's core ideas—dynamic social structures, expanding spaces, and multi-agent interaction—can be applied creatively to various web development scenarios using existing JavaScript tools and the power of LLMs.  The key takeaway is to think about how users interact, how their relationships change, and how the web application can adapt to this ever-evolving context.  LLMs can play a powerful role in analyzing this complex interaction landscape and guiding the web application's behavior accordingly.",
  "pseudocode": "The pseudocode in Equation (5) on page 27 describes an optimization problem to calculate the maximum number of times each event can be executed given initial resources, crafting recipes, and resource dependencies.

The function takes initial resources, crafting recipes, and resource dependencies as input. It works by iterating (in a real implementation, a more advanced optimization algorithm would be necessary for computational feasibility) through all valid combinations of event executions, calculating the final resources and credits earned for each combination, and keeping track of the combination that yields the highest credits. This \"optimal\" set of event counts is then used as a baseline to compute the *Completion Rate* for agents.\n\nThis simplified version uses nested loops for illustration. In a practical setting, you would likely use a more efficient optimization algorithm (e.g., dynamic programming, branch and bound) to explore the search space effectively, especially with a larger number of events and resources.  Also, the constraints outlined in equation (5) (e.g., dependencies on tools and prior crafted items) need to be carefully implemented in the `calculateCredits` function for the optimization to be accurate. The provided JavaScript example simply brute forces the solution for demonstration.",
