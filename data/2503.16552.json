  "title": "A Vehicle-Infrastructure Multi-layer Cooperative Decision-making Framework",
  "abstract": "Autonomous driving has entered the testing phase, but due to the limited decision-making capabilities of individual vehicle algorithms, safety and efficiency issues have become more apparent in complex scenarios. With the advancement of connected communication technologies, autonomous vehicles equipped with connectivity can leverage vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications, offering a potential solution to the decision-making challenges from individual vehicle's perspective. We propose a multi-level vehicle-infrastructure cooperative decision-making framework for complex conflict scenarios at unsignalized intersections. First, based on vehicle states, we define a method for quantifying vehicle impacts and their propagation relationships, using accumulated impact to group vehicles through motif-based graph clustering. Next, within and between vehicle groups, a pass order negotiation process based on Large Language Models (LLM) is employed to determine the vehicle passage order, resulting in planned vehicle actions. Simulation results from ablation experiments show that our approach reduces negotiation complexity and ensures safer, more efficient vehicle passage at intersections, aligning with natural decision-making logic.",
  "summary": "This paper proposes a multi-layered framework for coordinating autonomous vehicles (CAVs) at intersections using vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication.  It aims to improve safety and efficiency beyond the capabilities of individual vehicle algorithms.\n\nCrucially, the framework utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to negotiate the passing order of vehicles.  LLMs manage both intra-group (within clusters of influencing vehicles) and inter-group (between clusters) negotiations to establish a safe and efficient global traffic flow. This approach mimics human-like decision-making by allowing \"conversations\" between vehicles (mediated by the LLM) to resolve conflicts and establish priorities.  The system quantifies influence between vehicles based on factors like proximity and speed to cluster vehicles for negotiation and simplifies the computational complexity of coordination.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents a multi-layered cooperative decision-making framework for autonomous vehicles using Large Language Models (LLMs).  Let's translate these concepts into practical JavaScript examples for web developers building LLM-based multi-agent applications.\n\n**1. Impact Quantification and Group Division:**\n\n* **Concept:** The paper quantifies the \"impact\" of one agent on another based on proximity, relative speed, and direction. This impact is then used to cluster agents into groups for more efficient negotiation.\n* **JavaScript Application (Web Development):** Imagine a collaborative online whiteboard application with multiple users.  You can adapt the impact quantification method to determine which users' actions are most likely to interfere with each other.  Instead of physical proximity and speed, consider cursor proximity, drawing speed, and the areas being modified on the whiteboard.\n    * **Example:**\n        ```javascript\n        function calculateImpact(user1, user2) {\n          const proximity = distance(user1.cursor, user2.cursor);\n          const speedDiff = Math.abs(user1.drawSpeed - user2.drawSpeed);\n          const areaOverlap = calculateOverlap(user1.modifiedArea, user2.modifiedArea); \n          // ... combine these factors into a single impact score\n          return impactScore;\n        }\n\n        // Then, use a clustering algorithm (e.g., k-means, DBSCAN available in libraries like ml5.js, tensorflow.js) based on the impact scores to group users.\n        ```\n\n**2. LLM-based Negotiation (Intra-group and Inter-group):**\n\n* **Concept:** The paper uses LLMs to negotiate the order in which agents should proceed through a conflict zone (e.g., an intersection for cars, a shared resource in a web app). This involves both intra-group negotiation (within a cluster) and inter-group negotiation (between clusters).\n* **JavaScript Application (Chatbots, Collaborative Editing):**\n    * **Scenario:** Building a multi-agent chat system for customer support where several chatbots specialize in different areas. When multiple bots need to respond to the same customer query, you can use LLM-based negotiation to decide which bot takes the lead.\n    * **Example (Conceptual):**\n      ```javascript\n        async function negotiateResponse(bots, customerQuery) {\n          const relevantBots = filterRelevantBots(bots, customerQuery); // Filter bots based on expertise\n          const viewpoints = await Promise.all(relevantBots.map(bot => bot.generateViewpoint(customerQuery)));\n          const prompt = generateLLMPrompt(viewpoints, customerQuery); // Construct prompt for LLM\n          const negotiationResult = await queryLLM(prompt); // Get negotiation result from LLM (e.g., bot priorities)\n          return prioritizeBots(relevantBots, negotiationResult); // Prioritize bots based on LLM output\n        }\n      ```\n    * **Libraries:**  LangChain.js for interacting with LLMs and structuring prompts, and potentially Socket.IO for real-time communication between agents in your web application.\n\n**3. Action Calculation (Motion Planning):**\n\n* **Concept:** Once the negotiation determines the order, agents calculate their actions (e.g., acceleration/deceleration for vehicles, resource allocation in web apps).\n* **JavaScript Application (Resource Scheduling):**  Consider a web application that schedules tasks across multiple servers.  LLM negotiation could determine the task order, and then, a JavaScript function would calculate the resource allocation for each server based on the negotiated order, task requirements, and current server load.\n    * **Example:**\n        ```javascript\n        function allocateResources(servers, tasks, taskOrder) {\n          for (const taskId of taskOrder) {\n            const task = tasks[taskId];\n            const bestServer = findBestServer(servers, task.requirements); // Find the best server based on resource availability\n            allocateTaskToServer(bestServer, task); // Allocate the task to the chosen server\n            updateServerLoad(bestServer, task.resourceUsage); // Update the server load\n          }\n        }\n        ```\n\n**Key Takeaways for JavaScript Developers:**\n\n* The paper's core ideas—impact-based grouping and LLM-driven negotiation—are adaptable to a wide range of web development scenarios.\n* JavaScript offers various libraries and frameworks (LangChain.js, Socket.IO, TensorFlow.js, ml5.js) that simplify the implementation of these concepts.\n* Focus on translating the core principles (impact quantification, negotiation) into the context of your specific application, using relevant data and metrics.\n\n\nBy adapting these examples and principles, JavaScript developers can begin experimenting with the power of multi-agent systems and LLMs to build more sophisticated and intelligent web applications. Remember to consider the ethical implications and potential biases of LLMs when designing these systems.",
  "pseudocode": "The paper contains mathematical formulas within the text, but no explicit pseudocode blocks.  Therefore, the answer is \"No pseudocode block found\".  However, I can elaborate on the key algorithms described and offer equivalent JavaScript implementations:\n\n**1. Direct Influence Calculation (Equation 2):**\n\nThis algorithm calculates the direct influence one vehicle has on another based on their relative positions, velocities, and directions.\n\n```javascript\nfunction calculateDirectInfluence(vehicleI, vehicleJ) {\n  const dx = vehicleJ.x - vehicleI.x;\n  const dy = vehicleJ.y - vehicleI.y;\n  const dvx = vehicleJ.vx - vehicleI.vx;\n  const dvy = vehicleJ.vy - vehicleI.vy;\n\n  const relativePositionMagnitude = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);\n  const relativeVelocityMagnitude = Math.sqrt(dvx * dvx + dvy * dvy);\n\n  if (relativePositionMagnitude === 0 || relativeVelocityMagnitude === 0) {\n      return 0; // Handle division by zero\n  }\n  \n  const theta = Math.acos(\n      (dvx * dx + dvy * dy) /\n      (relativeVelocityMagnitude * relativePositionMagnitude)\n  );\n\n  const phi = Math.acos(\n      (vehicleJ.vx * dx + vehicleJ.vy * dy) /\n      (Math.sqrt(vehicleJ.vx * vehicleJ.vx + vehicleJ.vy * vehicleJ.vy) * relativePositionMagnitude)\n  );\n\n  let f0 = relativeVelocityMagnitude * Math.cos(theta) / relativePositionMagnitude;\n\n  f0 *= Math.sin(Math.PI - phi);\n\n  const f = f0 >= 0 ? f0 : 0; // Heaviside function\n\n  return f;\n}\n\n\n\n// Example usage (assuming you have vehicle objects with x, y, vx, vy properties)\nconst vehicle1 = { x: 10, y: 20, vx: 5, vy: 2 };\nconst vehicle2 = { x: 30, y: 40, vx: 3, vy: 1 };\nconst influence = calculateDirectInfluence(vehicle1, vehicle2);\nconsole.log(`Direct influence of vehicle1 on vehicle2: ${influence}`);\n\n```\n\n\n**2. Accumulated Influence Calculation (Equation 3):**\n\nThis algorithm extends the direct influence by considering indirect influences propagated through chains of vehicles.  It requires a graph traversal algorithm (not explicitly provided in the paper).  A simplified example using depth-first search (DFS) for illustration is provided below. This assumes you have a graph representation where nodes are vehicles and edges represent direct influences:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction calculateAccumulatedInfluence(graph, startNode, endNode) {\n\n    function dfs(currentNode, currentPath, visited) {\n        visited.add(currentNode);\n\n        if(currentNode === endNode) {\n            let pathInfluence = 1;\n\n            for(let i = 0; i < currentPath.length - 1; ++i) {\n                pathInfluence *= graph.getEdgeWeight(currentPath[i], currentPath[i + 1]);\n            }\n\n            allPathsInfluence.push(pathInfluence);\n\n            visited.delete(currentNode);\n            return;\n        }\n\n\n        for (const neighbor of graph.getNeighbors(currentNode)) {\n            if(!visited.has(neighbor)) {\n                dfs(neighbor, [...currentPath, neighbor], visited);\n            }\n        }\n         visited.delete(currentNode);\n    }\n\n    const allPathsInfluence = [];\n\n    dfs(startNode, [startNode], new Set()); // DFS traversal\n\n    return allPathsInfluence.reduce((sum, influence) => sum + influence, 0);\n}\n\n// Example usage (you'll need to implement the 'Graph' class and its methods)\n// const graph = new Graph(); // Your graph representation with vehicles as nodes and influences as edge weights\n// ... (add vehicles and edges to the graph)\n// const accumulatedInfluence = calculateAccumulatedInfluence(graph, vehicle1, vehicle2);\n// console.log(\"Accumulated influence:\", accumulatedInfluence);\n```\n\n\n**3. Motif-Based Spectral Clustering (Equation 4):**\n\nThis part involves calculating the Motif Adjacency Matrix (MAM) and then applying spectral clustering.  The paper refers to existing work [25] for the MAM calculation details.  The subsequent spectral clustering typically uses standard libraries.  A JavaScript implementation would require a suitable graph library and a numerical library for the eigenvector calculations.\n\n**4. LLM Negotiation:**\n\nThe paper describes the use of LLMs for negotiation, but this is not presented as a formal algorithm.  It's more of a system design where LLMs are used as components for communication and decision-making.\n\n\nThese JavaScript code snippets provide a starting point for understanding how the mathematical concepts in the paper can be translated into code. You'd need to adapt and integrate these pieces into a full multi-agent system simulation. Remember that handling graph representations, LLM integration, and the negotiation logic are significant development tasks beyond these core calculations.  Also, using a library like TensorFlow.js is recommended for handling the numerical computation involved in spectral clustering.",
