  "title": "A Learnable Agent Collaboration Network Framework for Personalized Multimodal Al Search Engine",
  "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques have revolutionized traditional information access, enabling AI agent to search and summarize information on behalf of users during dynamic dialogues. Despite their potential, current AI search engines exhibit considerable room for improvement in several critical areas. These areas include the support for multimodal information, the delivery of personalized responses, the capability to logically answer complex questions, and the facilitation of more flexible interactions. This paper proposes a novel AI Search Engine framework called the Agent Collaboration Network (ACN). The ACN framework consists of multiple specialized agents working collaboratively, each with distinct roles such as Account Manager, Solution Strategist, Information Manager, and Content Creator. This framework integrates mechanisms for picture content understanding, user profile tracking, and online evolution, enhancing the AI search engine's response quality, personalization, and interactivity. A highlight of the ACN is the introduction of a Reflective Forward Optimization method (RFO), which supports the online synergistic adjustment among agents. This feature endows the ACN with online learning capabilities, ensuring that the system has strong interactive flexibility and can promptly adapt to user feedback. This learning method may also serve as an optimization approach for agent-based systems, potentially influencing other domains of agent applications.",

  "takeaways": "This paper presents a novel architecture for LLM-powered AI Search Engines, moving beyond simple question-answering to a multi-agent system that understands user profiles, retrieves multimodal information, and adapts its responses over time. Here's how a JavaScript developer could apply these insights:\n\n**1. Multi-agent Architecture with Langchain.js:**\n\n* **Concept:** The paper proposes an \"Agent Collaboration Network\" (ACN) with specialized agents like Account Manager, Solution Strategist, Information Manager, and Content Creator.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**  Leverage Langchain.js to build this multi-agent system. Each agent can be a separate Langchain agent with its own prompt and tools. \n    * **Account Manager:**  Manages user interaction, profile tracking, and feedback using libraries like `localForage` for persistent storage.\n    * **Solution Strategist:**  Plans the information retrieval and generation process, potentially using Langchain's planning tools or a separate LLM fine-tuned for task decomposition.\n    * **Information Manager:** Uses APIs (e.g., Bing Search API) and web scraping (e.g., `cheerio.js`) to fetch multimodal information.\n    * **Content Creator:** Generates the final response, incorporating text, images, and tables using libraries like `markdown-it`.\n\n**2. Personalized Content with Vector Databases:**\n\n* **Concept:**  The ACN emphasizes personalized responses tailored to user profiles and preferences.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * **User Profile Storage:** Utilize vector databases like `Pinecone` or `Qdrant` to store and query user interest vectors.\n    * **Content Retrieval:** Embed retrieved information and user profiles as vectors. Use similarity search (e.g., cosine similarity) to find the most relevant information for each user.\n    * **Prompt Engineering:** Include relevant user profile information in the prompts for the Content Creator agent to guide personalized content generation.\n\n**3. Reflective Forward Optimization (RFO) with Prompt Versioning:**\n\n* **Concept:** The paper introduces RFO, an online learning method to adapt agent behavior based on user feedback.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * **Prompt Versioning:**  Maintain a history of prompts for each agent. This allows for rollback and analysis of prompt effectiveness.\n    * **Feedback Integration:** Use user feedback to trigger the RFO algorithm. The optimizer (another LLM) analyzes feedback and suggests prompt adjustments.\n    * **A/B Testing:** Experiment with different prompt variations to optimize agent performance and content relevance. \n\n**Example Scenario: Personalized Travel Recommendations**\n\nImagine building a travel recommendation web app using this paper's ideas:\n\n1. **User Interaction (Account Manager):**\n   - A user interacts with the app, providing preferences (e.g., \"I'm interested in historical sites, vegetarian food, and budget-friendly travel\").\n   - The Account Manager agent stores this information as a user profile vector in the vector database.\n\n2. **Planning (Solution Strategist):**\n   - The Solution Strategist receives the user's request and plans a series of actions:\n     - Search for historical sites in Europe.\n     - Find vegetarian restaurants in those locations.\n     - Look for affordable accommodation options.\n\n3. **Information Retrieval (Information Manager):**\n   - The Information Manager agent uses APIs like Google Places, travel blogs, and restaurant review websites to gather relevant information. It also fetches images and maps.\n\n4. **Content Creation (Content Creator):**\n   - The Content Creator agent, informed by the user profile and retrieved information, generates a personalized travel itinerary with:\n     - Descriptions of historical sites tailored to the user's interests.\n     - Recommendations for vegetarian-friendly restaurants.\n     - Budget-friendly accommodation suggestions.\n     - Images, maps, and links to relevant resources.\n\n5. **Feedback and Optimization (RFO):**\n   - The user provides feedback on the itinerary (e.g., \"Great suggestions! Could you include more information about local transportation?\").\n   - The RFO algorithm analyzes the feedback and suggests adjusting the Information Manager's prompt to include queries about transportation options.\n\n**JavaScript Libraries and Frameworks:**\n\n* **Langchain.js:** For building the multi-agent system, chaining LLMs, and managing prompts.\n* **Pinecone/Qdrant:**  For vector database storage and similarity search.\n* **Axios/Got:** For making API requests.\n* **Cheerio.js:** For web scraping.\n* **Markdown-it:** For rendering markdown content with images and tables.\n\nBy combining these technologies and concepts, JavaScript developers can create more engaging, personalized, and intelligent web experiences, pushing the boundaries of what's possible with LLM-powered applications.",
  "pseudocode": "```javascript\nfunction reflectiveForwardOptimization(userFeedback, agentCollaborationNetwork, intermediateResult) {\n  let feedback = userFeedback;\n  let stack = [[agentCollaborationNetwork.rootAgent, userFeedback]]; // Initialize stack with root agent and user feedback\n\n  while (stack.length > 0) {\n    let [currentAgent, currentFeedback] = stack.pop(); \n    let agentPrompt = currentAgent.prompt;\n    let result = intermediateResult[currentAgent.name]; \n\n    let [downstreamAgents, downstreamFeedbacks, promptReview] = optimizer(currentFeedback, agentPrompt, result); \n\n    currentAgent.reviewList = promptReview;\n\n    for (let i = 0; i < downstreamAgents.length; i++) {\n      stack.push([downstreamAgents[i], downstreamFeedbacks[i]]);\n    }\n  }\n\n  for (let agent of Object.values(agentCollaborationNetwork.agents)) { \n    agent.prompt = updatePrompt(agent.reviewList); \n  }\n\n  return agentCollaborationNetwork; \n}\n\nfunction optimizer(feedback, prompt, result) {\n  // This is a simplified example, you'd likely use an LLM for this in practice.\n  let downstreamAgents = [];\n  let downstreamFeedbacks = [];\n  let promptReview = \"\";\n\n  // Analyze feedback, prompt, and result to determine:\n  // 1. If the current agent is responsible for the feedback.\n  // 2. If so, generate promptReview with suggestions for parameter adjustments.\n  // 3. If not, identify downstream agents potentially responsible and generate appropriate downstreamFeedbacks.\n\n  return [downstreamAgents, downstreamFeedbacks, promptReview];\n}\n\nfunction updatePrompt(reviewList) {\n  // Aggregate review suggestions from reviewList and use an LLM to update the agent's prompt.\n  // ... Implementation depends on your LLM and aggregation strategy ...\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThis JavaScript code implements the **Reflective Forward Optimization (RFO)** algorithm described in the research paper. \n\n* **reflectiveForwardOptimization(userFeedback, agentCollaborationNetwork, intermediateResult):**\n    * This function is the core of the RFO algorithm. It takes user feedback, the agent collaboration network, and intermediate results as input.\n    * It uses a stack to perform a depth-first traversal of the agent call stack.\n    * For each agent, it calls the `optimizer` function to analyze feedback and generate reviews and downstream feedback.\n    * Finally, it updates the prompts of all agents based on the collected reviews.\n\n* **optimizer(feedback, prompt, result):**\n    * This function is responsible for analyzing user feedback in the context of a specific agent's prompt and generated result.\n    * The provided implementation is a placeholder. In a real application, you would utilize an LLM to analyze the feedback, identify responsible agents, suggest prompt adjustments, and generate downstream feedback for further analysis.\n\n* **updatePrompt(reviewList):**\n    * This function takes a list of reviews for an agent and updates the agent's prompt accordingly.\n    * The actual implementation depends on your LLM and how you choose to aggregate and apply the suggestions from the reviews.\n\n**Purpose of RFO:**\n\nThe RFO algorithm aims to address the limitation of current AI agents being \"expert-centric\" and unable to adapt based on user feedback. It enables online learning and adaptation for multi-agent AI systems by analyzing user feedback and propagating it through the agent network to refine agent prompts and behavior dynamically. This results in a more flexible and user-centric AI system.",
