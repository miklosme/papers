  "title": "CE-MRS: Contrastive Explanations for Multi-Robot Systems",
  "abstract": "Abstract-As the complexity of multi-robot systems grows to incorporate a greater number of robots, more complex tasks, and longer time horizons, the solutions to such problems often become too complex to be fully intelligible to human users. In this work, we introduce an approach for generating natural language explanations that justify the validity of the system's solution to the user, or else aid the user in correcting any errors that led to a suboptimal system solution. Toward this goal, we first contribute a generalizable formalism of contrastive explanations for multi-robot systems, and then introduce a holistic approach to generating contrastive explanations for multi-robot scenarios that selectively incorporates data from multi-robot task allocation, scheduling, and motion-planning to explain system behavior. Through user studies with human operators we demonstrate that our integrated contrastive explanation approach leads to significant improvements in user ability to identify and solve system errors, leading to significant improvements in overall multi-robot team performance.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces CE-MRS, a system for generating natural language explanations of multi-robot task allocation, scheduling, and motion planning solutions. CE-MRS uses a contrastive approach, comparing the system's solution to user-provided \"foil\" solutions to highlight key decision factors and potential errors. \n\nKey for LLM-based systems: CE-MRS demonstrates the value of contrastive explanations, a format well-suited to LLMs' text generation capabilities. The paper focuses on grounding explanations in underlying system data (robot traits, task requirements, etc.), which is crucial for LLM-generated explanations to be meaningful and trustworthy.  It also tackles a core challenge in multi-agent LLM apps: making complex, interdependent agent actions understandable to humans.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents a novel approach to generating explanations for multi-robot systems, particularly relevant for JavaScript developers building LLM-based multi-agent applications. Here are some practical examples of applying these insights:\n\n**Scenario: Collaborative Web Design Application**\n\nImagine building a web app where multiple LLMs collaborate to design website layouts based on user input.  Each LLM agent has different specializations (e.g., content generation, image selection, layout optimization).\n\n**1. Task Allocation & Explanation:**\n\n* **Challenge:** Users might wonder why a particular LLM is assigned to a specific task. For example, why is the \"image selection\" LLM generating the header text? \n* **Solution:** Implement CE-MRS concepts. When a user questions an LLM's role, the application can use contrastive explanations. It can illustrate:\n    * \"The 'image selection' LLM was assigned to generate header text because its training data includes analyzing website headers for visually appealing font choices.\" \n    *  \"While the 'content generation' LLM is capable of generating text,  the 'image selection' LLM is expected to produce a header that complements the overall visual style.\"\n\n**2. Scheduling & Performance Insights:**\n\n* **Challenge:**  Users experience delays or want to understand the process flow within the multi-agent system.\n* **Solution:**  Visualize scheduling using JavaScript libraries like D3.js or Chart.js. When a user queries the time taken for a task:\n    *  Display a Gantt chart-like representation showing each LLM's activity timeline.\n    *  Provide explanations:  \"The 'layout optimization' LLM started after the 'content generation' LLM because its algorithm requires analyzing the content structure for optimal element placement.\"\n\n**3. Error Detection and User Feedback:**\n\n* **Challenge:** An LLM might misinterpret user instructions, leading to suboptimal design choices. \n* **Solution:**\n    *  Allow users to provide feedback (e.g., \"The image doesn't fit the content\").\n    *  Use CE-MRS to generate explanations based on user foils: \"The 'image selection' LLM chose this image because it matched the keyword 'technology'. Would you like to refine the keywords or provide alternative images?\"\n\n**JavaScript Implementation Examples:**\n\n* **LLM Interaction:** Use JavaScript libraries like `langchain.js` to manage communication between your application and LLMs.\n* **Explanation Generation:** Leverage template literals or libraries like `jsdoc-to-markdown` to dynamically generate human-readable explanations based on the CE-MRS framework.\n* **Data Visualization:**  Employ D3.js or Chart.js to visually represent task allocation, scheduling, and performance metrics.\n\n**Key Takeaways for JavaScript Developers:**\n\n* **Transparency is Key:** CE-MRS provides a framework to make LLM-based multi-agent systems more transparent by explaining decision-making processes.\n* **User-Centric Design:** Design your web application to actively incorporate user feedback and provide explanations in a clear, understandable format.\n* **Leverage Existing Tools:** Numerous JavaScript libraries and frameworks can aid in implementing the core concepts of multi-agent communication, explanation generation, and data visualization.",
