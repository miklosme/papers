  "title": "ADAGE: A generic two-layer framework for adaptive agent based modelling",
  "abstract": "Agent-based models (ABMs) are valuable for modelling complex, potentially out-of-equilibria scenarios. However, ABMs have long suffered from the Lucas critique, stating that agent behaviour should adapt to environmental changes. Furthermore, the environment itself often adapts to these behavioural changes, creating a complex bi-level adaptation problem. Recent progress integrating multi-agent reinforcement learning into ABMs introduces adaptive agent behaviour, beginning to address the first part of this critique, however, the approaches are still relatively ad hoc, lacking a general formulation, and furthermore, do not tackle the second aspect of simultaneously adapting environmental level characteristics in addition to the agent behaviours. In this work, we develop a generic two-layer framework for ADaptive AGEnt based modelling (ADAGE) for addressing these problems. This framework formalises the bi-level problem as a Stackelberg game with conditional behavioural policies, providing a consolidated framework for adaptive agent-based modelling based on solving a coupled set of non-linear equations. We demonstrate how this generic approach encapsulates several common (previously viewed as distinct) ABM tasks, such as policy design, calibration, scenario generation, and robust behavioural learning under one unified framework. We provide example simulations on multiple complex economic and financial environments, showing the strength of the novel framework under these canonical settings, addressing long-standing critiques of traditional ABMs.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces ADAGE, a two-layer framework for creating adaptive agent-based models (ABMs).  It addresses the \"Lucas critique\" – the idea that agent behavior should change in response to changes in their environment, and the environment should also adapt to changes in agent behavior. ADAGE frames this as a Stackelberg game where an outer layer modifies environment characteristics, and an inner layer simulates agents whose behavior adapts to these changes.  This allows ADAGE to tackle various ABM tasks like policy design, calibration, scenario generation, and robust behavioral learning within a single, unified framework.\n\nFor LLM-based multi-agent systems, ADAGE offers a structure for building adaptive environments where LLMs can act as agents. The framework supports complex scenarios by allowing the environment to react to the LLMs’ actions, creating a more dynamic and realistic interaction. The ability to train for robust behavior across different settings and preferences makes ADAGE potentially useful for creating multi-agent systems where LLMs can generalize and adapt to new situations without retraining.  The conditional behavioral policies enable LLMs to learn behaviors based on changing circumstances within the simulation.",
  "takeaways": "This paper introduces ADAGE, a two-layer framework for creating adaptive agent-based models.  Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights to LLM-based multi-agent AI projects, focusing on web development scenarios:\n\n**1. Building Adaptive Chatbots/Agents:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  Imagine a customer service chatbot.  Instead of having static responses, you want the chatbot's behavior to adapt based on customer interactions and overall service goals (e.g., maximizing customer satisfaction, minimizing support time).\n* **ADAGE Application:**\n    * **Inner Layer (Follower Agents):** Individual chatbots (LLMs) interact with customers. Their behavior (dialogue generation) is parameterized by a \"characteristic\" like a politeness level or a proactiveness score.\n    * **Outer Layer (Leader Agent):**  Analyzes aggregate customer satisfaction metrics and adjusts the \"characteristic\" (e.g., increasing politeness if satisfaction is low).\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * **LLM Integration:** Use libraries like `LangChain.js` or `Hugging Face Inference API` to interface with LLMs.\n    * **Agent Framework:**  Develop a custom framework or adapt existing multi-agent simulation libraries (e.g., a simplified version of `MASON` adapted for JavaScript) to manage the chatbots and their interactions.\n    * **Outer Layer Optimization:** Implement the leader agent's logic using JavaScript and potentially integrate optimization libraries (e.g., a JavaScript port of `scipy.optimize`).\n* **Example:** If customer satisfaction drops below a threshold, the outer layer could increase the politeness parameter, causing the LLMs in the inner layer to generate more polite responses.\n\n**2. Personalized Content Recommendation:**\n\n* **Scenario:** A news website wants to recommend articles based on user preferences, while also adapting its overall recommendation strategy to maximize user engagement.\n* **ADAGE Application:**\n    * **Inner Layer (Follower Agents):** Individual recommendation agents (LLMs) suggest articles based on user history and a \"characteristic\" like a \"topic focus\" score (e.g., focusing more on technology or politics).\n    * **Outer Layer (Leader Agent):** Tracks aggregate user engagement metrics (clicks, time spent reading) and adjusts the \"topic focus\" of the recommendation agents.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * **LLM Integration:** Use LLMs for semantic understanding of articles and user profiles.\n    * **Agent Framework:**  Similar to the chatbot example, use a custom or adapted multi-agent simulation framework.\n    * **Outer Layer Optimization:** Implement the leader agent using JavaScript and optimization libraries.\n* **Example:** If users are consistently engaging more with technology articles, the outer layer could increase the \"topic focus\" on technology, leading to more technology-related recommendations.\n\n**3. Dynamic Pricing in E-commerce:**\n\n* **Scenario:** An online store wants to dynamically adjust product prices based on demand, competitor pricing, and overall sales goals.\n* **ADAGE Application:**\n    * **Inner Layer (Follower Agents):** Individual pricing agents (potentially simplified LLMs or rule-based agents) set prices based on market conditions and a \"characteristic\" like a \"discount aggressiveness\" parameter.\n    * **Outer Layer (Leader Agent):** Tracks overall sales and revenue and adjusts the \"discount aggressiveness\" of the pricing agents.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * **Agent Framework:** A custom multi-agent framework to simulate market dynamics.\n    * **Outer Layer Optimization:** Implement the leader agent using optimization algorithms.\n\n**Key Considerations for JavaScript Developers:**\n\n* **Simplified LLMs:** For some applications, simpler, specialized LLMs or even rule-based agents might suffice for the inner layer, reducing computational costs.\n* **Data Pipelines:** Robust data pipelines are crucial for collecting the necessary data for the outer layer optimization.\n* **Visualization:** JavaScript frameworks like `D3.js` or `Chart.js` can be used to visualize agent behavior and system dynamics.\n* **Experimentation:** Start with small-scale experiments and gradually increase complexity.\n\n\nBy adapting the ADAGE framework and leveraging the power of LLMs, JavaScript developers can build more adaptive, intelligent, and dynamic web applications. Remember to focus on specific scenarios and experiment iteratively to discover the best approach for each project.",
