  "title": "Single-Loop Federated Actor-Critic across Heterogeneous Environments",
  "abstract": "Federated reinforcement learning (FRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm, enabling multiple agents to collaborate and learn a shared policy adaptable across heterogeneous environments. Among the various reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, the actor-critic (AC) algorithm stands out for its low variance and high sample efficiency. However, little to nothing is known theoretically about AC in a federated manner, especially each agent interacts with a potentially different environment. The lack of such results is attributed to various technical challenges: a two-level structure illustrating the coupling effect between the actor and the critic, heterogeneous environments, Markovian sampling and multiple local updates. In response, we study Single-loop Federated Actor Critic (SFAC) where agents perform actor-critic learning in a two-level federated manner while interacting with heterogeneous environments. We then provide bounds on the convergence error of SFAC. The results show that the convergence error asymptotically converges to a near-stationary point, with the extent proportional to environment heterogeneity. Moreover, the sample complexity exhibits a linear speed-up through the federation of agents. We evaluate the performance of SFAC through numerical experiments using common RL benchmarks, which demonstrate its effectiveness.",
  "summary": "This paper proposes Single-loop Federated Actor-Critic (SFAC), a method for training a shared reinforcement learning policy across multiple agents in different environments without directly sharing their data.  The algorithm uses a two-level federated learning approach, aggregating both critic (value function) and actor (policy) updates from individual agents.  Convergence analysis shows that the error is limited by the differences between environments and that learning speed improves linearly with the number of agents.  This is relevant to LLM-based multi-agent systems because it offers a way to train shared or specialized LLMs in diverse, private settings, potentially improving generalization and allowing for personalization without compromising data privacy.  The focus on a mixture environment, randomly selecting from the agents' environments during evaluation, is also pertinent to LLM applications where diverse user needs must be met.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents Single-loop Federated Actor-Critic (SFAC), a method for training multiple agents in heterogeneous environments without directly sharing their data.  This has significant implications for LLM-based multi-agent web applications, allowing developers to leverage diverse user data while preserving privacy. Here are some practical examples for JavaScript developers:\n\n**1. Personalized Federated Learning for Chatbots:**\n\nImagine multiple businesses wanting to collaborate to improve their LLM-powered chatbots without sharing sensitive customer interaction data.  SFAC provides a solution. Each business could train a \"critic\" LLM locally, evaluating chatbot performance based on user feedback (e.g., satisfaction ratings, task completion). The \"actor\" LLMs, responsible for generating chatbot responses, are updated based on aggregated feedback from the critics.  This allows the chatbots to learn from a diverse dataset while keeping user data within each business.\n\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** Use a JavaScript machine learning library like TensorFlow.js or WebDNN to train the critic and actor LLMs within the browser. For communication, leverage WebSockets or a serverless function backend for federated averaging of model updates.\n\n**2. Collaborative Content Recommendation:**\n\nDifferent websites could use SFAC to collaboratively train recommendation systems without sharing user browsing history. Each website trains a local critic LLM to evaluate recommendation performance based on user clicks and engagement. Actor LLMs, responsible for generating recommendations, are updated based on the aggregated feedback from all websites.\n\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**  On the frontend, integrate with existing JavaScript recommendation libraries.  For backend aggregation, consider Node.js with a message queue system like RabbitMQ or Kafka to handle asynchronous updates from different websites.\n\n**3. Multi-Agent Game AI Development in the Browser:**\n\nDevelop a multi-agent game where agents learn collaboratively using SFAC. Each agent, running in a separate browser window, interacts with a unique instance of the game environment. Local critics evaluate performance, and actors control agent actions. Federated averaging allows agents to learn shared strategies while adapting to individual game conditions.\n\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** Use a JavaScript game engine like Phaser or Babylon.js. Each agent could have its own instance of the game running in a separate browser tab or worker, communicating with a central server through WebSockets for model updates.\n\n**4. Federated A/B Testing for Web UI Optimization:**\n\nImagine optimizing a website's user interface using a multi-agent approach. Each agent represents a different UI variant. Local critics, trained on user interaction data (e.g., time spent on page, conversion rate), evaluate the effectiveness of each variant.  Actors, responsible for selecting UI elements, are updated based on aggregated critic feedback.\n\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** Use a JavaScript A/B testing framework.  Integrate with browser analytics to collect user interaction data for training the critics.  The actor could be a serverless function that dynamically serves UI variants based on the latest federated updates.\n\n\n**Key Considerations for JavaScript Developers:**\n\n* **Communication overhead:** SFAC involves communication between agents and a central server. Optimize communication protocols (e.g., using efficient serialization) and update frequencies to minimize latency.\n* **Scalability:** Consider the scalability of your chosen JavaScript framework and backend infrastructure for handling a large number of agents.\n* **Privacy:** Ensure that the federated averaging process does not leak sensitive information. Differential privacy techniques can be incorporated to further enhance privacy.\n* **Heterogeneity:** SFAC is designed for heterogeneous environments. Carefully consider the differences between agents' environments and their potential impact on learning.\n\n\nBy understanding the principles of SFAC and leveraging existing JavaScript libraries and frameworks, developers can build innovative and privacy-preserving multi-agent web applications powered by LLMs. This allows for collaborative learning and improvement without the need for direct data sharing, opening up new possibilities for web development.",

Its purpose is to perform distributed policy evaluation across multiple agents. Each agent updates its local estimate of the value function using Temporal Difference (TD) learning, and then these local updates are aggregated by a central server to form a global value function estimate.  This approximates the optimal value function *w*** for a given policy.\n* **`federatedActor(theta_k, wk_plus_1, alpha_k)`:** This function implements the Federated Actor (FedA) algorithm. Its purpose is to perform distributed policy improvement. Each agent updates its local policy parameters (θ) based on the estimated advantage function (using the value function provided by FedC) and policy gradient theorem. These local policy updates are then aggregated to improve the shared global policy.\n* **`singleLoopFederatedActorCritic(K, alpha, beta, initial_theta)`:** This function orchestrates the entire Single-loop Federated Actor-Critic (SFAC) algorithm. It iteratively calls FedC and FedA to perform policy evaluation and improvement in a coordinated manner.  It is a \"single-loop\" algorithm because the critic and actor updates happen in a nested fashion, unlike \"double-loop\" where the critic fully converges before each actor update.\n\nThese algorithms, working together, allow multiple agents to learn a shared policy that performs well across their diverse, heterogeneous environments, without directly sharing their experienced data (which preserves privacy and reduces communication overhead). This approach is particularly relevant for scenarios like training LLMs in federated learning settings or developing multi-agent simulations in the browser.\n\n\nThis code provides a more complete structural outline in JavaScript.  The placeholder functions (`observeSample`, `calculateGradient`, `temporalDifferenceError`, `calculatePolicyGradient`) still need to be fleshed out with specific implementations depending on the environment, policy representation, and chosen basis functions (features) for the value function approximation. Libraries like TensorFlow.js or NumJs would be helpful for implementing vector/matrix operations within these functions.",
