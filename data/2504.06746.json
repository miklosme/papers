  "title": "Adaptive Human-Robot Collaborative Missions using Hybrid Task Planning",
  "abstract": "Abstract-Producing robust task plans in human-robot collaborative missions is a critical activity in order to increase the likelihood of these missions completing successfully. Despite the broad research body in the area, which considers different classes of constraints and uncertainties, its applicability is confined to relatively simple problems that can be comfortably addressed by the underpinning mathematically-based or heuristic-driven solver engines. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid approach that effectively solves the task planning problem by decomposing it into two intertwined parts, starting with the identification of a feasible plan and followed by its uncertainty augmentation and verification yielding a set of Pareto optimal plans. To enhance its robustness, adaptation tactics are devised for the evolving system requirements and agents' capabilities. We demonstrate our approach through an industrial case study involving workers and robots undertaking activities within a vineyard, showcasing the benefits of our hybrid approach both in the generation of feasible solutions and scalability compared to native planners.",
  "summary": "This paper proposes a hybrid approach to create robust, adaptable plans for human-robot teams in complex, uncertain environments. It uses classical planning to generate an initial plan and then uses probabilistic model checking and genetic algorithms to refine the plan, considering uncertainties like task failures and changing requirements.  This hybrid approach addresses the \"state explosion problem\" of probabilistic model checking, making it suitable for larger, more realistic scenarios.\n\nThe key points for LLM-based multi-agent systems are the decomposition of planning into deterministic and probabilistic stages, the use of meta-heuristic search to optimize plan robustness, and the ability to adapt plans incrementally at runtime in response to changes. This allows for efficient planning and verification in complex, real-world multi-agent systems where perfect prediction is impossible, mimicking how LLMs can generate and refine plans based on evolving contexts.",
  "takeaways": "This research paper presents a hybrid approach to task planning for multi-agent systems, focusing on robustness and adaptation in uncertain environments.  It's highly relevant to JavaScript developers building LLM-based multi-agent applications, especially in web development contexts. Let's explore practical examples:\n\n**1. Collaborative Web Applications:** Imagine building a collaborative web application for project management using LLMs as agents. Each agent could represent a team member, responsible for specific tasks.  This paper's approach can be applied as follows:\n\n* **Initial Task Planning (JavaScript/Node.js):** Use a JavaScript library like `unified-planning` (inspired by PDDL) to define the domain and problem, outlining tasks, dependencies, and agent capabilities. This initial plan is deterministic, ignoring uncertainties.\n* **Uncertainty Augmentation (JavaScript):** Integrate probabilistic data. For example, an LLM agent's ability to complete a \"write code\" task might have a success probability based on past performance or complexity. You would represent these probabilities in JavaScript objects related to each task and agent.\n* **Pareto Optimization (JavaScript with Genetic Algorithm Library):**  Use a JavaScript genetic algorithm library (like `jmetal.js`) to search for Pareto-optimal solutions.  Chromosomes could represent different task retry strategies for each agent.  Fitness functions would evaluate both the overall probability of success and the cost (e.g., time, resources).\n* **Runtime Adaptation (JavaScript/WebSockets):**  Implement real-time adaptation using WebSockets.  If an LLM agent fails to complete a task (e.g., generating satisfactory code), the client-side JavaScript code can communicate the failure to the server.  The server can then select a new plan from the Pareto set or trigger re-planning if necessary. The new plan would then be communicated back to the LLM agents.  This dynamic adaptation would minimize disruptions and improve robustness.\n\n**2. Multi-Agent Chatbots:**  Consider a website with multiple LLM-powered chatbots, each specializing in a different area (e.g., sales, support, technical).  The hybrid approach can be used to coordinate their interactions:\n\n* **Task Allocation (JavaScript/Node.js):**  A user's question triggers a task.  The initial task planning stage (in Node.js) determines which chatbot is best suited to handle it based on keywords, context, and agent expertise (probabilistically modeled).\n* **Uncertainty and Retry (JavaScript):**  If a chatbot fails to provide a satisfactory answer (e.g., low confidence score from the LLM), the system can retry with another chatbot or escalate to a human operator, implementing the retry strategies optimized in the Pareto set.\n* **Dynamic Routing (JavaScript/Frontend Framework):** Client-side JavaScript, using a framework like React or Vue, would dynamically route the user's interaction to the appropriate chatbot based on the evolving task plan.\n\n**3. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs):**  LLM agents could represent members of a DAO, making proposals and voting on decisions.\n\n* **Proposal Generation and Verification (JavaScript/Smart Contracts):**  LLM agents generate proposals. The hybrid planning system verifies that these proposals meet certain probabilistic criteria (e.g., likelihood of success, financial risk) before being submitted for a vote.\n* **Voting and Adaptation (JavaScript/Web3 Libraries):**  The voting outcome (recorded on the blockchain) triggers adaptation. The system might select a different plan from the Pareto set or re-plan based on the community's decision.  Web3 JavaScript libraries (like `ethers.js` or `web3.js`) would facilitate interaction with the blockchain.\n\n**Key JavaScript Libraries and Frameworks:**\n\n* **Planning:** `unified-planning` (or custom PDDL-inspired implementations)\n* **Genetic Algorithms:** `jmetal.js`, `genetic-js`\n* **Real-time Communication:** WebSockets, Socket.IO\n* **Frontend Frameworks:** React, Vue, Angular\n* **Web3 Integration:** `ethers.js`, `web3.js`\n\nBy adopting this hybrid approach, JavaScript developers can leverage the power of LLMs in multi-agent systems, building more robust, adaptive, and efficient web applications for a wide range of scenarios, from collaborative workspaces to decentralized organizations. This paper provides a blueprint for navigating the complexities of uncertainty in multi-agent AI, translating sophisticated research into actionable JavaScript development practices.",

It handles four types of changes (C1-C4) that can occur during plan execution: task failures, changes in success probabilities, changes in assignment thresholds, and changes in individual agent success probabilities.\n\nThe algorithm's purpose is to efficiently adapt the current plan (II) when a change occurs, minimizing replanning overhead. It maintains a Pareto-optimal set of verified plans (PS) and uses various helper functions (reduce\\_PS\\_*, select\\_NEW\\_PLAN, generate\\_NEW\\_PLANS) to filter the set based on the type of change and select a new plan. If no suitable plan is found in the existing set, the algorithm triggers a complete replanning from scratch.\n\n\nThe helper functions are placeholders. Their implementations depend on the data structures used to represent plans, tasks, and agents.  The `getTaskFromChange` and similar helper functions demonstrate how one might extract relevant information from a change notification.  You'll need to adapt these based on your change representation format.",
