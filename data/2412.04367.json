  "title": "Machine Theory of Mind for Autonomous Cyber-Defence",
  "abstract": "Intelligent autonomous agents hold much potential for the domain of cyber security. However, due to many state-of-the-art approaches relying on uninterpretable black-box models, there is growing demand for methods that offer stakeholders clear and actionable insights into their latent beliefs and motivations. To address this, we evaluate Theory of Mind (ToM) approaches for Autonomous Cyber Operations. Upon learning a robust prior, ToM models can predict an agent's goals, behaviours, and contextual beliefs given only a handful of past behaviour observations. In this paper, we introduce a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based ToM architecture tailored for cyber-defence, Graph-In, Graph-Out (GIGO)-ToM, which can accurately predict both the targets and attack trajectories of adversarial cyber agents over arbitrary computer network topologies. To evaluate the latter, we propose a novel extension of the Wasserstein distance for measuring the similarity of graph-based probability distributions. Whereas the standard Wasserstein distance lacks a fixed reference scale, we introduce a graph-theoretic normalization factor that enables a standardized comparison between networks of different sizes. We furnish this metric, which we term the Network Transport Distance (NTD), with a weighting function that emphasizes predictions according to custom node features, allowing network operators to explore arbitrary strategic considerations. Benchmarked against a Graph-In, Dense-Out (GIDO)-ToM architecture in an abstract cyber-defence environment, our empirical evaluations show that GIGO-ToM can accurately predict the goals and behaviours of various unseen cyber-attacking agents across a range of network topologies, as well as learn embeddings that can effectively characterize their policies.",
  "summary": "This paper explores using a Machine Theory of Mind (MToM) model, specifically a Graph Neural Network (GNN) based ToMnet variant called GIGO-ToM, to predict the behavior of adversarial agents in a simulated cybersecurity environment.  It focuses on predicting which high-value targets attackers will pursue and their likely attack paths through a network. A novel metric, Network Transport Distance (NTD), is introduced to evaluate these predictions by measuring the similarity between predicted and actual attack trajectories, considering network topology.\n\nKey points for LLM-based multi-agent systems:\n\n* **Graph-based reasoning:** GIGO-ToM uses GNNs for processing network data, offering a natural fit for representing relationships and dependencies in multi-agent scenarios, especially where the environment structure is crucial (like computer networks or social interactions).  This is highly relevant to LLMs operating within structured environments.\n* **Predicting agent behavior:**  The core function is predicting the goals (targets) and actions (attack paths) of other agents, a critical capability for LLMs in multi-agent collaborative or competitive settings.\n* **Interpretable metric:**  The NTD metric offers an interpretable measure of prediction accuracy, crucial for evaluating and improving LLM performance and understanding their decision-making process.  The weighting component of NTD allows focusing on specific aspects of the prediction.\n* **Potential for NTD as a loss function:**  Preliminary work suggests NTD could be used as a differentiable loss function for directly training models to predict agent behavior in structured environments, offering a new training paradigm for LLMs in multi-agent systems.\n* **Few-shot learning:**  GIGO-ToM exhibits promising few-shot learning capabilities, important for LLMs which are often computationally expensive to train on large datasets.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents exciting opportunities for JavaScript developers working with LLM-based multi-agent systems, especially in web application contexts. Here's how you can apply its insights:\n\n**1. Dynamic Multi-Agent Interactions in Web Apps:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine building a collaborative web application like a shared document editor or a real-time strategy game.  Multiple users (agents) interact, each with their own goals and strategies.\n* **GIGO-ToM in JavaScript:**  You can implement a simplified version of GIGO-ToM using a JavaScript graph library like `vis-network` or `sigma.js`. Represent the application's state as a graph (e.g., document structure, game map). Use an LLM to generate user embeddings based on their past actions.  Then, use a Graph Neural Network (GNN) library like `tfjs-node` (TensorFlow.js for Node.js) or `brain.js` to process these embeddings and the graph to predict future user actions within the application's state graph.\n* **Example:** In the document editor, the graph could represent paragraphs and their relationships. The GNN, informed by the LLM-generated user embeddings, could predict which paragraph a user is likely to edit next.\n\n**2. Personalized User Experiences:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  E-commerce websites or online learning platforms can use multi-agent systems to personalize user experiences.  The system acts as an agent, and each user is another agent.\n* **Predicting User Navigation:** Use GIGO-ToM to predict user navigation patterns on a website.  The website's structure is the graph.  LLMs can create embeddings based on user history, preferences, and current session activity. A GNN processes these with the website graph to predict which page a user is likely to visit next, enabling pre-fetching or personalized recommendations.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**  Use libraries like `Next.js` or `React` for front-end development, Node.js and Express.js for back-end, and integrate an LLM like the OpenAI API. Employ a JavaScript graph database like `Neo4j` if needed.\n\n**3. Enhanced Chatbots and Conversational Interfaces:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Build a multi-agent chatbot system where different chatbots specialize in different areas.  They can collaborate to answer complex user questions or complete tasks.\n* **ToM for Chatbot Coordination:** Use a simplified ToM approach to let chatbots reason about each other's \"beliefs\" (knowledge domains).  An LLM can analyze the conversation history to determine which chatbot is best suited to respond. This can make chatbot interactions more natural and efficient.\n* **JavaScript Tools:** Use Node.js with a conversational AI framework like `Botpress` or `Rasa` for individual chatbot development.  Implement the ToM logic as a coordination layer using a JavaScript LLM library.\n\n**4. Building Trust and Transparency:**\n\n* **Scenario:** In applications where AI agents make decisions that impact users (e.g., loan applications, medical diagnoses), it's crucial to build trust and explain the AI's reasoning.\n* **Network Transport Distance (NTD) in JavaScript:**  Implement NTD in JavaScript to quantify the difference between an AI agent's predicted actions and the actual outcomes within the application's context (graph). Visualize these discrepancies using a JavaScript charting library like `Chart.js` or `D3.js`. This helps users understand the limitations of the AI and identify potential biases or errors.\n\n**Key Libraries and Frameworks:**\n\n* **LLM Integration:** LangChain, OpenAI API, Cohere API\n* **Graph Libraries:** `vis-network`, `sigma.js`, `cytoscape.js`\n* **GNN Libraries:** `tfjs-node`, `brain.js`\n* **Front-end Frameworks:** `React`, `Vue.js`, `Angular`, `Svelte`\n* **Back-end Frameworks:** Node.js with Express.js, NestJS\n* **Graph Databases:** `Neo4j`, `ArangoDB`\n* **Visualization Libraries:** `Chart.js`, `D3.js`\n\n**Example: Basic ToM in a Collaborative Drawing App (Conceptual):**\n\n```javascript\n// Simplified example: User embeddings from LLM (replace with actual LLM call)\nconst userEmbeddings = {\n  user1: [0.2, 0.5, 0.1],\n  user2: [0.8, 0.1, 0.6],\n};\n\n// Graph representation of the drawing canvas (using vis-network, etc.)\nconst nodes = [/* Node data for drawing elements */];\nconst edges = [/* Edge data connecting elements */];\n\n// Simplified GNN (using brain.js, etc.)\nconst net = new brain.NeuralNetwork();\n// Train the GNN on past user actions and embeddings\n\n// Predict next action for user1\nconst input = { ...userEmbeddings.user1, /* Features of current drawing state */ };\nconst prediction = net.run(input);\n// prediction will contain probabilities for different actions (e.g., draw, erase, move)\n```\n\nRemember, these are simplified examples to get you started.  Adapting these concepts to production systems will require careful consideration of scalability, security, and user experience. But the paper provides a valuable theoretical foundation for building truly intelligent and interactive web applications.",
