  "title": "Naive Algorithmic Collusion: When Do Bandit Learners Cooperate and When Do They Compete?",
  "abstract": "Algorithmic agents are used in a variety of competitive decision settings, notably in making pricing decisions in contexts that range from online retail to residential home rentals. Business managers, algorithm designers, legal scholars, and regulators alike are all starting to consider the ramifications of \"algorithmic collusion.\" We study the emergent behavior of multi-armed bandit machine learning algorithms used in situations where agents are competing, but they have no information about the strategic interaction they are engaged in. Using a general-form repeated Prisoner's Dilemma game, agents engage in online learning with no prior model of game structure and no knowledge of competitors' states or actions (e.g., no observation of competing prices). We show that these context-free bandits, with no knowledge of opponents' choices or outcomes, still will consistently learn collusive behavior what we call \"naive collusion.\" We primarily study this system through an analytical model and examine perturbations to the model through simulations. Our findings have several notable implications for regulators. First, calls to limit algorithms from conditioning on competitors' prices are insufficient to prevent algorithmic collusion. This is a direct result of collusion arising even in the naive setting. Second, symmetry in algorithms can increase collusion potential. This highlights a new, simple mechanism for \"hub-and-spoke\" algorithmic collusion. A central distributor need not imbue its algorithm with supra-competitive tendencies for apparent collusion to arise; it can simply arise by using certain (common) machine learning algorithms. Finally, we highlight that collusive outcomes depend starkly on the specific algorithm being used, and we highlight market and algorithmic conditions under which it will be unknown a priori whether collusion occurs.",
  "summary": "This paper explores how simple AI agents (specifically, multi-armed bandit algorithms) learn to \"collude\" (cooperate to achieve higher rewards) in a competitive setting, even when they are not explicitly programmed to do so and have no knowledge of each other or the game structure (Prisoner's Dilemma).\n\nKey findings relevant to LLM-based multi-agent systems:\n\n* **Naive collusion is possible:** Even without explicit communication or knowledge of the overall game, agents using certain algorithms (e.g., deterministic bandits, UCB with certain parameters) can learn to cooperate.  This has implications for LLM agents that might implicitly coordinate even without being specifically designed for it.\n* **Algorithm choice matters:** The specific algorithm used drastically impacts the emergent behavior. Deterministic algorithms tend to lead to collusion, while algorithms with built-in randomness (e.g., epsilon-greedy) tend towards competition. This highlights the critical importance of algorithm selection in multi-agent LLM systems to achieve the desired level of cooperation or competition.\n* **Symmetry increases collusion potential:**  Using the same algorithm across agents increases the likelihood of collusion, especially in a \"hub-and-spoke\" scenario where a central distributor provides the algorithm. This is relevant to LLM deployments where multiple instances of similar models might interact.\n* **Collusion is not guaranteed:** Even with similar algorithms, small variations (e.g., in tie-breaking rules) and different payoff structures can significantly impact outcomes, making it difficult to predict whether collusion will occur. This points towards the need for careful monitoring and analysis of emergent behavior in multi-agent LLM systems.\n* **Implications for regulation:** Traditional antitrust regulations are based on explicit agreements. The possibility of naive collusion challenges this notion, raising questions about how to regulate unintended cooperative behavior in AI systems. This has relevance to the development and deployment of multi-agent LLM applications.",
  "takeaways": "This paper's findings on naive algorithmic collusion have significant implications for JavaScript developers building LLM-based multi-agent applications, especially in web development. Here are some practical examples and considerations:\n\n**1. Competitive Bidding/Auction Platforms:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine building a decentralized auction platform using LLMs as bidding agents.  Multiple agents, representing different users, interact to bid on items.\n* **Insight:**  Using identical deterministic bandit algorithms for each agent (e.g., a simple UCB implementation in JavaScript) could lead to unintended collusion, driving prices up artificially.  Even without explicit communication, the agents might implicitly learn to cooperate and avoid aggressive bidding.\n* **Solution:** Introduce asymmetry in the agents' algorithms.  This can be achieved by:\n    * Using different bandit algorithms for different agents (e.g., UCB for some, Epsilon-Greedy for others, Thompson Sampling, etc.).\n    * Randomizing hyperparameters like the exploration parameter (δ in UCB, ε in Epsilon-Greedy) within a reasonable range for each agent.  This can be done easily in JavaScript using `Math.random()`.\n    * Implementing agent-specific bidding strategies or heuristics as part of the LLM prompt engineering process.\n* **Libraries:**  Implementations of common bandit algorithms are available in JavaScript libraries like `ml.js`. You can then integrate these algorithms into your application logic using Node.js and a frontend framework like React or Vue.js.\n\n**2. Collaborative Content Creation/Editing:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Multiple LLM-powered agents collaborate on writing articles or editing documents in a real-time web application.\n* **Insight:** If all agents use identical deterministic algorithms for deciding which edits to accept or reject, they might fall into a suboptimal equilibrium where valuable contributions are consistently rejected due to naive algorithmic \"agreement.\"\n* **Solution:** Design agents with diverse editing styles by training them on different datasets or providing them with different reward functions.  Introduce randomness into their decision-making process.\n* **Frameworks:**  Real-time collaboration features can be implemented using frameworks like Socket.IO or Yjs, which can handle the synchronization of agent actions and document updates.\n\n**3. Multi-Agent Game Development:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  Developing a browser-based game where multiple LLM agents interact. This could be a simulation, a strategy game, or even a more complex role-playing game within a web environment.\n* **Insight:** If all agents use the same deterministic algorithm to determine their moves, the game could become predictable and lack emergent gameplay.  Naive collusion could lead to unintended alliances or stagnation.\n* **Solution:** Introduce diverse agent personalities and strategies by using a combination of different algorithms (deterministic and stochastic) and through careful LLM prompt design. Consider evolutionary algorithms or reinforcement learning techniques to evolve agent strategies over time.\n* **Libraries:** Game development libraries like Phaser or Babylon.js could be used to handle the game logic and rendering within the browser.  TensorFlow.js or other machine learning libraries could be used for more complex agent training and development directly in the browser.\n\n**General Recommendations for JavaScript Developers:**\n\n* **Experiment with Different Algorithms:** Don't default to a single bandit algorithm. Explore and compare the behavior of UCB, Epsilon-Greedy, Thompson Sampling, and other variations in your specific multi-agent scenarios.\n* **Embrace Asymmetry and Randomness:** Introduce variations in agent algorithms and parameters to prevent naive collusion and encourage more complex, emergent behavior.\n* **Monitor and Analyze Agent Interactions:** Implement logging and visualization tools to understand how your agents are learning and interacting. This can help identify unintended patterns or problematic behavior.\n* **Consider Simulated Environments:** Before deploying your multi-agent application, test it thoroughly in simulated web environments to understand potential risks and optimize agent behavior.\n\n\nBy keeping these insights and recommendations in mind, JavaScript developers can leverage the power of LLMs to create dynamic and robust multi-agent web applications while mitigating the risks of naive algorithmic collusion.",

It begins by exploring heavily (high `epsilon`) and gradually shifts towards exploitation (low `epsilon`) as it learns which actions yield higher rewards. The `eta` parameter controls the decay rate.  The function takes arrays of possible actions, and rewards from each round. For each round it chooses an action either greedily based on the actionValues array (which is updated at each round). Alternatively it selects a random action based on the epsilon value. It returns the final action values after all rounds.\n\n**UCB (Upper Confidence Bound):**  This algorithm also tackles the exploration-exploitation problem. It estimates the upper confidence bound for each action, selecting the action with the highest bound. This \"optimistic\" strategy promotes exploration of actions whose true value might be higher than currently estimated. The `delta` parameter controls the confidence interval. The function takes arrays of possible actions, and rewards from each round. For each round it calculates the UCB value for each action based on the current actionValue and actionCount. If actionCount is zero, the UCB value is infinity. Otherwise it is calculated using the formula defined in the paper, using delta. The action with the highest UCB value is selected, and actionValues and actionCounts are updated. Finally, it returns the actionValues array.",
