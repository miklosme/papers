  "title": "Separation Assurance in Urban Air Mobility Systems using Shared Scheduling Protocols",
  "abstract": "Ensuring safe separation between aircraft is a critical challenge in air traffic management, particularly in urban air mobility (UAM) environments where high traffic density and low altitudes require precise control. In these environments, conflicts often arise at the intersections of flight corridors, posing significant risks. We propose a tactical separation approach leveraging shared scheduling protocols, originally designed for Ethernet networks and operating systems, to coordinate access to these intersections. Using a decentralized Markov decision process framework, the proposed approach enables aircraft to autonomously adjust their speed and timing as they navigate these critical areas, maintaining safe separation without a central controller. We evaluate the effectiveness of this approach in simulated UAM scenarios, demonstrating its ability to reduce separation violations to zero while acknowledging trade-offs in flight times as traffic density increases. Additionally, we explore the impact of non-compliant aircraft, showing that while shared scheduling protocols can no longer guarantee safe separation, they still provide significant improvements over systems without scheduling protocols.",
  "summary": "This paper explores using shared scheduling protocols, similar to those in networking and operating systems, to manage air traffic, specifically for Urban Air Mobility (UAM) systems.  Aircraft are treated as independent agents, and intersections of flight paths are treated as bottlenecks/critical resources.  The goal is to prevent collisions by coordinating aircraft access to these intersections using decentralized decision-making.\n\nKey points for LLM-based multi-agent systems:\n\n* **Decentralized Coordination:** The proposed methods, CSMA/CD and SRTF,  allow agents (aircraft) to make decisions based on local observations, without a central controller, much like agents in a distributed web application might interact.\n* **Resource Management:** The concept of bottlenecks/critical resources directly translates to resource contention problems in web applications where multiple agents need to access shared databases, APIs, or other resources.\n* **Conflict Resolution:**  The shared scheduling protocols demonstrate strategies for resolving conflicts among autonomous agents, useful for scenarios where LLMs act as agents within a larger system.\n* **Safety and Performance Tradeoffs:** The paper highlights the inherent trade-off between ensuring safety (no collisions) and performance (flight times), a consideration relevant when designing multi-agent web applications with competing objectives.\n* **Non-Compliant Agents:** The research also examines the impact of agents that don't follow the established protocol, valuable for understanding robustness in open, dynamic web environments where some LLM agents might not strictly adhere to the intended behavior.",
  "takeaways": "This paper explores using shared scheduling protocols for separation assurance in multi-agent systems, particularly relevant for simulated air traffic control.  While the context is specific, the core concepts are valuable for JavaScript developers working with LLM-based multi-agent applications, especially in web development. Here are some practical examples:\n\n**1. Coordinating Access to Shared Resources:** Imagine a collaborative web application like a shared document editor with multiple users (agents) simultaneously making changes. Direct concurrent access can lead to conflicts and data corruption.  Shared scheduling protocols can help.\n\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** You could leverage libraries like `async.js` or custom queues to manage access. Each agent submits its intended action (e.g., text insertion, formatting) to a queue. A central scheduler (or a distributed consensus algorithm) grants \"go\" signals based on the chosen protocol (CSMA/CD, SRTF, Round Robin). Agents only execute actions after receiving the \"go\".\n\n* **LLM Integration:**  The LLM can enhance the scheduler by predicting potential conflicts based on the agents' intended actions. This predictive capability can improve the efficiency of the chosen protocol. For instance, if the LLM detects that two agents intend to edit the same paragraph, the scheduler can prioritize one based on its predicted impact or urgency.\n\n\n**2. Managing Chatbots in a Multi-User Environment:** In a customer service scenario, multiple chatbots (agents) might need access to the same database or external API (critical resource).  Uncoordinated access can lead to rate limiting, server overload, or inconsistent responses.\n\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**  Node.js with its event-driven architecture is well-suited for this. You could use a message broker like Redis or RabbitMQ to manage access requests.  Each chatbot sends a request message indicating its intent (e.g., query customer data).  The broker acts as the scheduler, distributing \"go\" signals based on a chosen protocol, ensuring only one chatbot accesses the resource at a time.\n\n* **LLM Integration:** The LLM can be used to prioritize chatbot requests based on conversation context and urgency.  A chatbot dealing with a critical customer issue would be prioritized over one handling a routine query.  This would require the LLM to analyze the chat logs and assign priority scores.\n\n\n\n**3. Decentralized Game Development:** Consider a browser-based multiplayer game with many players (agents) interacting in a virtual world.  Shared resources could be specific locations, items, or in-game actions.\n\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** WebSockets can facilitate real-time communication and coordination.  Each client (agent) implements a lightweight scheduling protocol logic.  When an agent intends to interact with a shared resource, it broadcasts a request message to other nearby agents. The protocol logic determines which agent gets access based on local observations, minimizing the need for a central server.\n\n* **LLM Integration:** LLMs can play the role of individual agent decision-making. They can analyze the game state, other players' actions, and choose optimal strategies within the constraints of the shared scheduling protocol, leading to more intelligent and dynamic gameplay.\n\n\n\n**Key JavaScript Technologies and Libraries:**\n\n* **`async.js`:** For managing asynchronous operations and implementing queues.\n* **Node.js with message brokers (Redis, RabbitMQ):** For implementing distributed schedulers.\n* **WebSockets:** For real-time communication in decentralized scenarios.\n* **LLM APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Cohere):** For integrating language models for prediction, prioritization, and agent decision-making.\n\n\n**Simplified Example (CSMA/CD for shared document editing):**\n\n```javascript\n// Simplified example: CSMA/CD-like logic for shared document access.\n\nlet editing = false;\n\nfunction editDocument(agentId, action) {\n  if (editing) {\n    // Collision detected, wait random time\n    setTimeout(() => editDocument(agentId, action), Math.random() * 1000);\n  } else {\n    editing = true;\n    console.log(`Agent ${agentId} performing action: ${action}`);\n    // Simulate editing time\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      editing = false; \n    }, 1000);\n  }\n}\n\n\neditDocument(1, \"Insert text\");\neditDocument(2, \"Format paragraph\"); // Will wait\n\n```\n\n\nThis simplified example demonstrates the basic idea of collision detection and random backoff.  A real-world implementation would be more complex, involving robust message passing, distributed consensus, and LLM integration for richer agent behaviors.  By understanding the principles of shared scheduling protocols, JavaScript developers can build more scalable and robust multi-agent systems for a variety of web applications.",
  "pseudocode": "The paper includes pseudocode for three shared scheduling protocols: CSMA/CD, SRTF, and Round Robin. Here are their JavaScript implementations along with explanations:\n\n**1. CSMA/CD (Carrier-Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection)**\n\n```javascript\nfunction csmaCdProtocol(agentI, agents, intersection, waitTime) {\n  const phi_i = agentI.flightCorridor;\n  const U_i = agentI.route;\n  const v_i = agentI.velocity;\n  const W_i = waitTime[agentI.id];\n\n\n  if (W_i > 0) {\n    waitTime[agentI.id]--; // decrement wait time\n    return \"wait\";\n  } else if (!intersection.includes(phi_i) && agents.some(agentJ => intersection.includes(agentJ.flightCorridor) && !U_i.includes(agentJ.flightCorridor) && agentJ.velocity !== 0)) {\n    return \"wait\";\n  } else if (intersection.includes(phi_i) && v_i === 0 && agents.some(agentJ => intersection.includes(agentJ.flightCorridor) && !U_i.includes(agentJ.flightCorridor) && agentJ.velocity !== 0)) {\n     return \"wait\";\n  } else {\n    return \"go\";\n  }\n}\n\n// Example usage (Illustrative):\nconst agents = [/* ... agent objects with flightCorridor, route, velocity, etc. ...*/];\nconst intersection = [/* ...flight corridor ids belonging to the intersection ... */];\nconst waitTime = {}; // initialize wait times - usually randomly in case of collision\n\n// Main loop snippet (Illustrative)\nagents.forEach(agentI => {\n    if(csmaCdProtocol(agentI, agents, intersection, waitTime) === \"go\") {\n         // Agent can proceed\n    } else {\n       // agent waits\n       if(!waitTime[agentI.id]){ // only set if not already waiting due to collision. \n            waitTime[agentI.id] =  Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1; // random wait time 1-100 steps\n        }\n    }\n});\n\n\n```\n\n*Explanation:* CSMA/CD is a decentralized protocol where aircraft \"listen\" for others before entering an intersection. If the intersection is clear, the aircraft proceeds. If a collision (simultaneous entry) occurs, both aircraft wait for a random time before trying again. This JavaScript version reflects the logic by checking if other aircraft are present in the intersection and setting a wait time if a conflict occurs.\n\n\n**2. SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First)**\n\n```javascript\nfunction srtfProtocol(agentI, agents, intersection) {\n  const phi_i = agentI.flightCorridor;\n  const U_i = agentI.route;\n  const v_i = agentI.velocity;\n  const d_center_i = agentI.distanceToCenter;\n\n\n  if (intersection.includes(phi_i) && agents.some(agentJ => {\n        const phi_j = agentJ.flightCorridor;\n        const U_j = agentJ.route;\n        const d_center_j = agentJ.distanceToCenter;\n        return intersection.includes(phi_j) && !U_i.includes(phi_j) && agentJ.velocity !== 0 && d_center_j < d_center_i;\n  })) {\n    return \"wait\";\n\n  } else if (intersection.includes(phi_i)  && agents.some(agentJ => {\n        const phi_j = agentJ.flightCorridor;\n        const U_j = agentJ.route;\n        const d_center_j = agentJ.distanceToCenter;\n        return intersection.includes(phi_j) && !U_i.includes(phi_j) && agentJ.velocity !== 0 && d_center_j === d_center_i;\n  })) {\n      return \"wait\"; // Or handle tie-breaking with a random wait. \n  } else if (!intersection.includes(phi_i) && agents.some(agentJ => intersection.includes(agentJ.flightCorridor) && !U_i.includes(agentJ.flightCorridor) && agentJ.velocity !== 0)) {\n    return \"wait\";\n  } else {\n    return \"go\";\n  }\n}\n```\n\n*Explanation:*  SRTF is also decentralized. In case of a collision, the aircraft closest to the intersection's center gets priority (assumed to have the shortest remaining time to exit).  The JavaScript implementation checks distances to determine priority.\n\n\n**3. Round Robin**\n\n```javascript\nlet currentPriorityRoute = null; \nlet prioritySwitchTimer = 100;\n\nfunction roundRobinProtocol(agentI, intersection) {\n  const phi_i = agentI.flightCorridor;\n  const U_i = agentI.route;\n\n    if(!currentPriorityRoute){\n        currentPriorityRoute = intersection[0]; // Or any other logic to choose an initial route. \n    }\n\n    prioritySwitchTimer--;\n    if(prioritySwitchTimer <= 0){\n        const currentIndex = intersection.indexOf(currentPriorityRoute);\n        currentPriorityRoute = intersection[(currentIndex + 1) % intersection.length]; // Switch to the next route.\n        prioritySwitchTimer = 100;\n    }\n\n    if (U_i.includes(currentPriorityRoute)) {\n      return \"go\";\n    } else {\n      return \"wait\";\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\n*Explanation:* Round Robin is *centralized*. It assigns turns to each route in a cyclical manner. The provided JavaScript code uses a `currentPriorityRoute` variable and a timer (`prioritySwitchTimer`) to manage turns. Aircraft on the current priority route can proceed, while others must wait.\n\n\n\nThese JavaScript snippets capture the core logic of the shared scheduling protocols as presented in the paper, adapting them to a format familiar to JavaScript developers and illustrating how the abstract concepts can be translated into practical code for multi-agent simulation or development. Remember that these are simplified examples, and a full implementation would require additional details such as environment modeling, agent dynamics, and collision detection mechanisms. They provide a concrete starting point for JavaScript developers to begin experimenting with multi-agent coordination using these established protocols.",
