  "title": "A Multi-Loss Strategy for Vehicle Trajectory Prediction: Combining Off-Road, Diversity, and Directional Consistency Losses",
  "abstract": "Trajectory prediction is essential for the safety and efficiency of planning in autonomous vehicles. However, current models often fail to fully capture complex traffic rules and the complete range of potential vehicle movements. Addressing these limitations, this study introduces three novel loss functions: Offroad Loss, Direction Consistency Error, and Diversity Loss. These functions are designed to keep predicted paths within driving area boundaries, aligned with traffic directions, and cover a wider variety of plausible driving scenarios. As all prediction modes should adhere to road rules and conditions, this work overcomes the shortcomings of traditional \"winner takes all\" training methods by applying the loss functions to all prediction modes. These loss functions not only improve model training but can also serve as metrics for evaluating the realism and diversity of trajectory predictions. Extensive validation on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets with leading baseline models demonstrates that our approach not only maintains accuracy but significantly improves safety and robustness, reducing offroad errors on average by 47% on original and by 37% on attacked scenes. This work sets a new benchmark for trajectory prediction in autonomous driving, offering substantial improvements in navigating complex environments. Our code is available at https://github.com/vita-epfl/stay-on-track.",
  "summary": "This research introduces improved loss functions for training AI models to predict vehicle trajectories, enhancing safety and performance in self-driving scenarios.  The new loss functions penalize off-road deviations, incorrect direction following, and lack of diversity in predicted paths. This ensures the AI considers a wider range of plausible, safe maneuvers.  The focus on training all predicted trajectories, not just the single most likely one, directly benefits multi-agent LLM systems by enabling them to reason about and react to various possible actions of other agents (vehicles in this case) in a more robust and comprehensive manner. This promotes safer and more effective interactions within dynamic environments.",
  "takeaways": "This research paper presents valuable insights for JavaScript developers working with LLM-based multi-agent systems in web applications. Let's explore practical applications with code examples and relevant JavaScript tools:\n\n**1. Offroad Loss & Geofencing:**\n\nImagine a multi-agent delivery simulation in a browser game built with Three.js or Babylon.js.  Each agent (delivery bot) is powered by an LLM and needs to navigate a city map.  The Offroad Loss can be implemented as a geofencing mechanism.\n\n```javascript\n// Using Turf.js for geospatial operations\nimport * as turf from '@turf/turf';\n\n// Drivable area polygon (predefined or loaded from map data)\nconst drivableArea = turf.polygon([[/* Coordinates of drivable area */]]);\n\n// Agent's predicted position\nconst agentPosition = turf.point([longitude, latitude]);\n\n// Check if agent is offroad\nconst isOffroad = !turf.booleanPointInPolygon(agentPosition, drivableArea);\n\n// Calculate Offroad Loss (simplified example)\nconst offroadLoss = isOffroad ? turf.distance(agentPosition, drivableArea) : 0;\n\n\n// Incorporate the loss into the LLM's prompt or reward function.\n// Example with LangChain:\nconst prompt = `You are a delivery bot at ${agentPosition}. Deliver the package to [destination].  Penalty: ${offroadLoss} for going off-road. Drivable area defined as: ${JSON.stringify(drivableArea.geometry.coordinates)}`\n\nconst llm = new OpenAI({ temperature: 0.7 });\nconst completion = await llm.call(prompt);\n\n// Process the LLM's response (e.g., movement instructions)\n```\n\n**2. Direction Consistency & Traffic Flow:**\n\nIn a traffic simulation using React and Leaflet, maintaining realistic traffic flow is essential. The Direction Consistency Error can guide LLM-powered agents to follow traffic rules.\n\n```javascript\n// Access road direction from Leaflet map data (e.g., using OpenStreetMap data)\nconst roadDirection = map.getLayer('roadLayer').getFeature(roadId).properties.direction;\n\n\n// LLM prompt incorporates the road direction information\n// Using a hypothetical LLM API call\nconst llmResponse = await llm.generateAction({\n  agentPosition: [longitude, latitude],\n  roadDirection: roadDirection, // e.g., 'north', 'south', 'east', 'west'\n  destination: [destinationLongitude, destinationLatitude]\n});\n\n// If LLM suggests a move that violates roadDirection, penalize\n// within the application logic or reflect it in the next LLM prompt.\n\n// Update agent's position on the map based on the validated LLM response\n```\n\n**3. Diversity Loss & Exploration:**\n\nFor a multi-agent collaborative task, such as finding optimal paths in a maze (visualized using D3.js), the Diversity Loss encourages agents to explore different strategies.\n\n```javascript\n// Store paths explored by each agent\nconst agentPaths = {};\n\n// Function to calculate diversity loss (simplified)\nfunction calculateDiversityLoss(paths) {\n  let totalDistance = 0;\n  for (let i = 0; i < paths.length; i++) {\n    for (let j = i + 1; j < paths.length; j++) {\n       // Calculate distance between paths (e.g. Hausdorff Distance using turf.js)\n       totalDistance += turf.distance(paths[i],paths[j])\n\n    }\n  }\n  return totalDistance;\n}\n\n// After each agent (LLM) proposes a path\nagentPaths[agentId] = proposedPath;\n\nconst diversityLoss = calculateDiversityLoss(Object.values(agentPaths));\n\n\n// Adjust LLM prompts based on diversityLoss: higher loss encourages new paths.\n// LangChain example:\nconst nextPrompt = `Explore a different path. Current paths too similar. Penalty:${diversityLoss} for similar path.`;\n\n// Update visualization with diverse paths\n```\n\n**Key JavaScript Libraries & Frameworks:**\n\n* **Turf.js:** For geospatial calculations (distance, point-in-polygon, etc.).\n* **Leaflet:** For interactive maps and accessing map data.\n* **Three.js/Babylon.js:** For 3D visualizations and simulations.\n* **D3.js:** For data visualizations, including paths and graphs.\n* **LangChain:** For building applications with LLMs.\n\n\nBy incorporating these concepts and tools, JavaScript developers can create more robust, realistic, and efficient LLM-based multi-agent applications for the web. This allows for exploring new possibilities in interactive simulations, games, and collaborative problem-solving platforms.  Remember, these are simplified examples to illustrate the core concepts; adaptation and more advanced implementations would be required for real-world scenarios.",
  "pseudocode": "No pseudocode block found. However, mathematical formulas defining the loss functions can be translated into JavaScript functions.  Let's convert the core loss functions into JavaScript:\n\n**1. Offroad Loss (Equation 2):**\n\n```javascript\nfunction offroadLoss(trajectory, drivableArea, margin) {\n  let totalLoss = 0;\n  for (let i = 0; i < trajectory.length; i++) { // Iterate through predictions (modes)\n    for (let t = 0; t < trajectory[i].length; t++) { // Iterate through timesteps\n      const point = trajectory[i][t];\n      const signedDistance = signedDistanceToPolygon(point, drivableArea);\n      totalLoss += Math.max(signedDistance + margin, 0);\n    }\n  }\n  return totalLoss / (trajectory.length * trajectory[0].length);\n}\n\n\n// Helper function (implementation omitted for brevity, but uses standard computational geometry techniques)\nfunction signedDistanceToPolygon(point, polygon) {\n //Calculates signed distance from point to polygon boundary\n// Positive if outside, negative if inside.\n}\n```\n\n* **Explanation:** This function calculates the penalty for predicted trajectories going off-road.  `trajectory` is a 2D array representing predicted paths (modes and timesteps). `drivableArea` is an array of polygons defining the drivable area. The `signedDistanceToPolygon` helper function (not fully implemented here for brevity, but readily available in computational geometry libraries or implementable using ray casting) computes the signed distance from a point to the polygon boundary. The loss increases the further a predicted point is outside the drivable area.\n\n\n\n**2. Direction Consistency Error (Equation 3):**\n\n```javascript\n\nfunction directionConsistencyError(trajectory, centerlines, distanceMargin, angleMargin){\n  let totalLoss = 0;\n  for(let i = 0; i < trajectory.length; i++){ //Iterate through predictions(modes)\n    for(let t = 0; t < trajectory[i].length; t++){ // Iterate through timesteps\n        let minDelta = Infinity;\n        const point = trajectory[i][t];\n        const heading = calculateHeading(trajectory[i],t) //calculate heading from trajectory\n\n\n        for(let s=0; s < centerlines.length; s++){ //Iterate through centerline segments\n            for(let k=0; k < centerlines[s].length; k++){ //Iterate through points in centerline\n                const centerlinePoint = centerlines[s][k];\n                const dist = Math.sqrt(Math.pow((centerlinePoint.x-point.x),2) + Math.pow((centerlinePoint.y-point.y),2));\n                const angleDiff = Math.abs(heading-centerlinePoint.heading)\n\n                const delta = Math.max(dist - distanceMargin,0) +  Math.max(angleDiff- angleMargin,0);\n\n                minDelta = Math.min(minDelta, delta);\n\n            }\n        }\n         totalLoss += minDelta\n    }\n\n  }\n  return totalLoss/(trajectory.length*trajectory[0].length)\n}\n\n// Helper function (implementation not shown for brevity)\nfunction calculateHeading(trajectory, timestep) {\n    // Calculate heading (direction of travel) from trajectory data at a given timestep\n}\n\n```\n\n* **Explanation:** This function penalizes trajectories that don't align with road directions. `centerlines` is a 3D array (segment, point, [x,y, heading]). The function calculates the directional difference (`delta`) between each trajectory point and the nearest centerline segment, considering both positional and heading deviations.  `distanceMargin` and `angleMargin` are tolerances for distance and angle differences respectively.\n\n\n**3. Mode Diversity (Equation 4):**\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction modeDiversity(trajectory, drivableArea) {\n  let diversityLoss = 0;\n  const feasibleTrajectories = trajectory.filter(traj => isTrajectoryFeasible(traj, drivableArea));\n\n\n  for (let i = 0; i < feasibleTrajectories.length; i++) {\n    for (let j = i + 1; j < feasibleTrajectories.length; j++) {\n      for (let t = 0; t < feasibleTrajectories[i].length; t++) {\n          const dist = Math.sqrt(Math.pow((feasibleTrajectories[i][t].x-feasibleTrajectories[j][t].x),2) + Math.pow((feasibleTrajectories[i][t].y-feasibleTrajectories[j][t].y),2))\n        diversityLoss += dist;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  return diversityLoss/(feasibleTrajectories.length*(feasibleTrajectories.length-1)/2 * trajectory[0].length );\n}\n\nfunction isTrajectoryFeasible(trajectory, drivableArea){\n    for (let t=0; t<trajectory.length;t++){\n        if (signedDistanceToPolygon(trajectory[t],drivableArea)>0)\n            return false;\n    }\n\n    return true;\n\n}\n\n```\n\n* **Explanation:**  This function encourages the model to predict diverse, feasible trajectories. It first filters for trajectories entirely within the `drivableArea` using a helper function. Then, it computes the sum of pairwise distances between all feasible trajectories at each timestep, promoting a wider spread of predictions.\n\n\nThese JavaScript functions provide a foundation for incorporating the described loss functions into an LLM-based multi-agent system.  These would be used as auxiliary loss functions within a larger training loop for the trajectory prediction model.  Helper functions like `signedDistanceToPolygon` and `calculateHeading` are assumed to be implemented using standard computational geometry and vector math techniques. Remember to install necessary computational geometry libraries if needed.  These translations provide a concrete starting point for JavaScript developers working on multi-agent trajectory prediction.",
