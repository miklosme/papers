  "title": "Uncommon Belief in Rationality",
  "abstract": "Common knowledge/belief in rationality is the traditional standard assumption in analysing interaction among agents. This paper proposes a graph-based language for capturing significantly more complicated structures of higher-order beliefs that agents might have about the rationality of the other agents. The two main contributions are a solution concept that captures the reasoning process based on a given belief structure and an efficient algorithm for compressing any belief structure into a unique minimal form.",
  "summary": "This paper proposes a graph-based model called RBR (Rationality and Beliefs in Rationality) graphs to represent complex higher-order beliefs about rationality in multi-agent systems, moving beyond the simpler common knowledge/belief assumptions. It introduces \"doxastic rationalizability\" as a solution concept for predicting agent behavior in games with uncommon belief structures and an algorithm to compress these graphs into minimal forms for efficient computation.\n\nFor LLM-based multi-agent systems, the key takeaway is the ability to model nuanced rationality assumptions using RBR graphs, allowing for more realistic and complex agent interactions. The efficient graph compression algorithm could prove useful for managing the computational complexity associated with higher-order beliefs in practical implementations involving LLMs.  The iterative rationalization process, driven by the graph structure, offers a mechanism to simulate LLM agents reasoning about each other's actions and beliefs in dynamic contexts.",
  "takeaways": "This paper introduces RBR (Rationality and Beliefs in Rationality) graphs as a way to model and analyze multi-agent systems where agents have potentially incomplete or incorrect beliefs about each other's rationality. This has significant implications for LLM-based multi-agent app development in JavaScript, especially when dealing with complex interactions and emergent behaviors.  Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights:\n\n**1. Modeling Agent Interactions with RBR Graphs:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine building a collaborative writing app where multiple LLMs assist users.  Each LLM has a specific role (grammar checker, style editor, idea generator), but they might have different understandings of each other's capabilities.  \n* **Implementation:** Use a JavaScript graph library like `vis-network` or `sigma.js` to represent the RBR graph. Nodes represent the LLMs, and edges represent beliefs about rationality.  Node attributes can store agent roles and current rationalization state (e.g., what strategies the agent believes are rational).  Edge attributes can store the strength or certainty of the belief.\n* **Code Example (Conceptual):**\n\n```javascript\n// Using vis-network (adjust for your chosen library)\nconst nodes = new vis.DataSet([\n  { id: 1, label: 'Grammar Checker', strategies: ['correct', 'suggest'], ... },\n  { id: 2, label: 'Style Editor', strategies: ['formal', 'informal'], ... },\n  // ... more LLMs\n]);\n\nconst edges = new vis.DataSet([\n  { from: 1, to: 2, beliefStrength: 0.8 }, // Grammar checker believes style editor is mostly rational\n  // ... more beliefs\n]);\n\nconst network = new vis.Network(container, { nodes, edges }, options);\n\n\n// Update strategies based on rationalization:\nfunction rationalize(agentId) {\n  const agentNode = nodes.get(agentId);\n  const beliefScene = getBeliefScene(agentId); // Based on connected edges\n  agentNode.strategies = eliminateDominatedStrategies(agentNode.strategies, beliefScene);\n  nodes.update(agentNode);\n}\n```\n\n**2. Simulating Rationalization:**\n\n* **Scenario:** In the writing app, an LLM might initially suggest highly complex sentences because it doesn't believe the style editor will enforce simplicity.  As it observes the style editor's actions, it updates its belief and rationalizes its strategies.\n* **Implementation:** Implement the `eliminateDominatedStrategies` function based on the game's rules (e.g., preference for simple sentences). The `getBeliefScene` function constructs the reasoning scene based on the agent's connections in the RBR graph. You could integrate an LLM interface (e.g., LangChain) to execute actions based on chosen strategies and query beliefs.\n* **Code Example (Conceptual):**\n\n```javascript\nfunction getBeliefScene(agentId) {\n  const beliefScene = {};\n  network.getConnectedNodes(agentId, 'to').forEach(neighborId => {\n    const neighbor = nodes.get(neighborId);\n    beliefScene[neighbor.label] = neighbor.strategies;\n  });\n  return beliefScene;\n}\n\n// ... eliminateDominatedStrategies and other logic\n```\n\n\n**3. Minimizing Complexity with Canonical RBR Graphs:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  As the number of LLMs in your application grows, the RBR graph can become complex, making simulation and analysis computationally expensive.\n* **Implementation:**  Implement Algorithm 1 from the paper to reduce the RBR graph to its canonical form.  This minimizes the number of nodes while preserving the system's strategic properties. This could involve custom JavaScript code or using a graph algorithm library.\n\n**4. Visualization and Debugging:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  Understanding emergent behavior in multi-agent LLM systems is challenging.\n* **Implementation:**  Use the visualization capabilities of graph libraries to dynamically display the RBR graph, showing how agent beliefs and strategies change during the rationalization process. Highlight dominated strategies visually to understand why agents discard certain actions.\n\n**5. Libraries and Frameworks:**\n\n* **Graph Libraries:** `vis-network`, `sigma.js`, `cytoscape.js`\n* **LLM Integration:** LangChain, LlamaIndex\n* **State Management:** Redux, MobX (for managing complex agent states and beliefs)\n\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n\n* **Simplified Rationalization:** The paper simplifies rationalization to eliminating strongly dominated strategies.  In a real-world application, you'll need a more sophisticated approach that accounts for probabilities and utilities.\n* **Dynamic Belief Updates:** This paper focuses on static RBR graphs.  In a real application, beliefs would change dynamically based on observations.  Research how to implement these dynamic updates in your graph representation.\n* **Scalability:** For complex applications with many agents, efficient graph representation and manipulation are crucial.\n\n\nBy applying the concepts of RBR graphs and rationalization from this paper, JavaScript developers can build more robust and understandable LLM-based multi-agent applications.  The ability to model, simulate, and visualize complex agent interactions provides valuable tools for debugging, analyzing emergent behavior, and ultimately designing more effective multi-agent systems.",

Its core purpose is to minimize a given RBR (Rationality and Beliefs in Rationality) graph. An RBR graph represents the higher-order beliefs agents have about each other's rationality.  Minimizing the graph means finding an equivalent graph with the fewest possible nodes, which simplifies analysis and computation related to game-theoretic reasoning in multi-agent systems.\n\nThe algorithm works by iteratively refining a partition of the nodes in the input RBR graph. Initially, the nodes are partitioned based on their agent labels.  In each iteration, the partition is refined by considering the outgoing edges of the nodes and the partitions they lead to. This refinement process continues until the partition becomes stable (i.e., no further refinement is possible). Each set in the final stable partition corresponds to a node in the minimized RBR graph.\n\nThe core logic is implemented primarily within the `while` loop. The key operations are calculating the `type` of each node (which reflects its outgoing connections), radix sorting the nodes to efficiently group those with the same `type`, and updating the partition based on this grouping. The code leverages JSON stringification for efficient comparison of the `type` arrays. Once the `while` loop terminates (signifying a stable partition), the minimized RBR graph's components (nodes, edges, labelling, and designating functions) are constructed based on the final partition.\n\n\n\nThe function returns a minimized RBR graph, represented by the `Nprime`, `Eprime`, `lprime`, and `piprime` variables.  This minimized graph is equivalent to the original input graph but has the fewest possible nodes, thus representing the most concise representation of the agents' beliefs about rationality.",
