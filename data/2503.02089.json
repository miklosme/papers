  "title": "Improved MMS Approximations for Few Agent Types",
  "abstract": "We study fair division of indivisible goods under the maximin share (MMS) fairness criterion in settings where agents are grouped into a small number of types, with agents within each type having identical valuations. For the special case of a single type, an exact MMS allocation is always guaranteed to exist. However, for two or more distinct agent types, exact MMS allocations do not always exist, shifting the focus to establishing the existence of approximate-MMS allocations. A series of works over the last decade has resulted in the best-known approximation guarantee of  + 3836/3. In this paper, we improve the approximation guarantees for settings where agents are grouped into two or three types, a scenario that arises in many practical settings. Specifically, we present novel algorithms that guarantee a-MMS allocation for two agent types and a 11-MMS allocation for three agent types. Our approach leverages the MMS partition of the majority type and adapts it to provide improved fairness guarantees for all types.",
  "summary": "This paper explores fair distribution of indivisible items among agents with different preferences (valuation functions), focusing on the maximin share (MMS) fairness criterion.  It presents improved approximation algorithms for scenarios where agents are grouped into two or three types with identical valuations within each type.\n\nFor two agent types, the algorithm leverages the MMS partition of the majority type and achieves a ⅘-MMS guarantee. For three types, the algorithm categorizes items based on their value for different types and uses a tailored bag-filling algorithm, achieving a ¹⁶⁄₂₁-MMS guarantee. The grouping of agents by type and the adaptation of bag-filling algorithms based on item valuation are relevant to developing efficient resource allocation strategies in multi-agent systems where agents may exhibit similar behavior or preferences (like specialized LLM agents for a particular task or domain).  The analysis of a small number of agent types suggests it might be possible to leverage similar type-based reasoning for simplified coordination mechanisms in more complex multi-agent systems, even with more diverse agents.",
  "takeaways": "This paper's focus on improved MMS approximations for few agent types (2 and 3) using a modified SHV partition offers interesting possibilities for JavaScript developers working with LLM-based multi-agent web applications.  While the paper doesn't directly deal with LLMs, the resource allocation strategies can be adapted to manage prompts, responses, and computational resources among LLM agents.\n\nHere are some practical examples in web development scenarios:\n\n**1. Multi-User Text Generation Application:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine a collaborative writing application where multiple users (agents) with different writing styles (types) use LLMs to generate text.  Each user has a \"budget\" for LLM calls (resources).\n* **Application of Insights:** The SHV partition concept can be used to allocate \"high-value\" prompts (those expected to generate the most relevant or creative text) fairly.  The paper's algorithms can ensure that even users with smaller budgets get a chance to use high-value prompts.  You can track the budget and prompt allocation using a JavaScript library like Redux or MobX for state management.\n* **Implementation:**  A Node.js backend could manage resource allocation, using a queue system for prompts. When a user submits a prompt, it's categorized based on expected value (e.g., using a heuristic based on prompt length, keywords, or even a separate LLM for evaluation). The algorithm then assigns the prompt to an agent based on the SHV partition and remaining budget. The frontend (e.g., using React) displays the generated text and remaining budget to each user.\n\n**2. Chatbot Ensemble for Customer Service:**\n\n* **Scenario:** A website uses an ensemble of specialized chatbots (agents, different types) powered by different LLMs. Each chatbot excels at a specific task (e.g., technical support, sales, general inquiries). Incoming customer messages (resources) need to be routed efficiently.\n* **Application of Insights:**  The paper's algorithms can ensure fair distribution of incoming customer messages based on chatbot specialization. \"High-value\" messages (e.g., those requiring immediate attention or those from high-value customers) are allocated preferentially based on a modified SHV partition, ensuring that each chatbot receives an appropriate mix of messages and no chatbot is overloaded.\n* **Implementation:**  A serverless function (e.g., using AWS Lambda or Azure Functions) could categorize incoming messages using natural language processing (NLP) libraries like Compromise or Natural. The categorized message is then routed to the appropriate chatbot based on the algorithm's allocation strategy, implemented in JavaScript. Socket.io can be used for real-time communication between the server and clients.\n\n**3. Decentralized LLM-Powered Search Engine:**\n\n* **Scenario:** A decentralized search engine uses multiple LLMs (agents, different types) hosted on different nodes to process search queries (resources). Each LLM might have different strengths (e.g., understanding specific domains, handling different languages).\n* **Application of Insights:**  The algorithms can be adapted to distribute search queries fairly amongst the LLMs, taking into account their strengths and available computational resources. High-value queries (those requiring complex processing or those from premium users) can be allocated using a modified SHV partition to ensure optimal performance and fairness.\n* **Implementation:** A peer-to-peer library like Libp2p can facilitate communication between the nodes. Each node runs a JavaScript implementation of the allocation algorithm to decide which LLM should handle a given query.  The results are aggregated and returned to the user.\n\n**Key JavaScript Considerations:**\n\n* **Libraries:** For state management (Redux, MobX), NLP (Compromise, Natural), real-time communication (Socket.io), and peer-to-peer networking (Libp2p).\n* **Asynchronous Programming:**  LLM calls are inherently asynchronous. Promises and async/await are crucial for managing these operations effectively.\n* **Performance:**  Implementing these algorithms efficiently in JavaScript requires careful consideration of data structures and algorithmic complexity.\n\nBy adapting the insights from this research paper, JavaScript developers can create more robust, fair, and efficient multi-agent applications powered by LLMs.  The key is to translate the resource allocation concepts into practical strategies for managing prompts, responses, and computation within a web development context.",

This means dividing the items into `n` bundles, each containing exactly one high-valued item (from the top `n` valued items), and maximizing the minimum value among the bundles. This is a building block for later algorithms handling multiple agent types.\n* **Explanation:** This algorithm initializes with an approximate MMS partition (using an external PTAS). It then iteratively refines this partition to ensure the SHV constraint is satisfied. It achieves this by swapping items between bags and using a bag-filling procedure to distribute remaining lower valued items.  A crucial element is proving that during this process, we never run out of items to fill the bags. This SHV-MMS partition is key for solving more complex multi-agent scenarios. Note: This javascript code relies on an external implementation of the PTAS algorithm to find an initial approximate MMS partition as its a complex algorithm in itself.\n\n```javascript\n// Algorithm 2: (4/5)-MMS for 2-type ONI Instance\nfunction twoTypeMMS(n, m, T1, T2, v1, v2, alpha = 4/5) {\n\n  const I_hat = [n, m, [n], [v1]]; // 1-type ONI instance from majority type v1\n\n  let A = shvMMS(...I_hat); // Call Algorithm 1\n\n  A.sort((a, b) => value(a,v2) - value(b,v2)); // Sort by minority type's valuation (v2)\n\n  let assignment1 = A.slice(0, T1);\n  let assignment2 = A.slice(T1);\n\n\n if (assignment2.every(bag => value(bag, v2) >= alpha)) {\n  return [assignment1, assignment2]\n } else {\n\n    let P = assignment2.flat();\n\n    let newAssignment2 = Array(T2).fill(null).map(() => []);\n    for (let i = 0; i <T2; i++) {\n      newAssignment2[i].push(P[i]); \n    }\n\n    let remainingP = P.slice(T2);\n\n    let assignment2Index = 0\n\n    for (let item of remainingP) {\n      newAssignment2[assignment2Index%newAssignment2.length].push(item)\n      assignment2Index++;\n    }\n\n\n  return [assignment1, newAssignment2];\n }\n}\n```\n\n**Algorithm 2: (4/5)-MMS Allocation for Two Agent Types**\n\n* **Purpose:** This algorithm aims to find a (4/5)-MMS allocation for a fair division instance with two distinct agent types.\n* **Explanation:**  It leverages the SHV-MMS partition generated by Algorithm 1 for the majority type (the type with more agents). It sorts the bags based on the minority type's valuation.  If the remaining bags are all valued at least 4/5 of the MMS by the minority type, they are assigned directly. Otherwise, a bag-filling procedure is initiated, ensuring each remaining agent (of the minority type) receives a satisfactory bundle.\n\n```javascript\n// Algorithm 3: (16/21)-MMS for 3-type ONI Instance\n\nfunction threeTypeMMS(n, m, T1, T2, T3, v1, v2, v3, alpha = 16/21) {\n\n  // ...

It again starts with the SHV-MMS partition for the majority type. Then, it categorizes the bundles based on their values to the other two types (Algorithm 4).  Different assignment strategies are employed based on these categories and the agent counts of each type.  The most complex scenario (Case 4) requires a dedicated sub-algorithm (Algorithm 5) for careful bag-filling and saturation.\n\n**Algorithm 4: Categorize Bags**\n\n* **Purpose:** Used within Algorithm 3.  Categorizes the bags of the SHV-MMS partition based on whether they are \"liked\" (valued at or above a threshold) by each of the two minority types.\n* **Explanation:**  Simple categorization into four groups (C1 to C4) according to valuations.  Facilitates the case analysis within Algorithm 3.\n\n**Algorithm 5: Case 4 Sub-Algorithm (within Algorithm 3)**\n\n* **Purpose:**  Handles the challenging scenario (Case 4) within the 3-type MMS allocation.\n* **Explanation:**  Algorithm 5 embodies a sophisticated bag-filling and saturation procedure using remaining high, medium, and low-valued items. It prioritizes certain allocations and strategically postpones others to ensure all agents eventually receive satisfactory bundles.\n\n\nThese JavaScript implementations give a concrete structure to the algorithms.  The complexity of a full, robust implementation, especially for algorithms 3 and 5, necessitates addressing edge cases and potentially adding optimization strategies. However, this translation provides a solid foundation for JavaScript developers to begin exploring and implementing these multi-agent resource allocation techniques in web applications.",
