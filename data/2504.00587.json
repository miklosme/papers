  "title": "AGENTNET: DECENTRALIZED EVOLUTIONARY COORDINATION FOR LLM-BASED MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS",
  "abstract": "The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed the development of multi-agent systems, where multiple LLM-based agents collaborate to solve complex tasks. However, existing systems predominantly rely on centralized coordination, which introduces scalability bottlenecks, limits adaptability, and creates single points of failure. Additionally, concerns over privacy and proprietary knowledge sharing hinder cross-organizational collaboration, leading to siloed expertise. To address these challenges, we propose AgentNet, a decentralized, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based framework that enables LLM-based agents to autonomously evolve their capabilities and collaborate efficiently in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-structured network. Unlike traditional multi-agent systems that depend on static role assignments or centralized control, AgentNet allows agents to specialize dynamically, adjust their connectivity, and route tasks without relying on predefined workflows. AgentNet's core design is built upon several key innovations: (1) Fully Decentralized Paradigm: Removing the central orchestrator, allowing agents to coordinate and specialize autonomously, fostering fault tolerance and emergent collective intelligence. (2) Dynamically Evolving Graph Topology: Real-time adaptation of agent connections based on task demands, ensuring scalability and resilience. (3) Adaptive Learning for Expertise Refinement: A retrieval-based memory system that enables agents to continuously update and refine their specialized skills. By eliminating centralized control, AgentNet enhances fault tolerance, promotes scalable specialization, and enables privacy-preserving collaboration across organizations. Through decentralized coordination and minimal data exchange, agents can leverage diverse knowledge sources while safeguarding sensitive information. Experimental results demonstrate that AgentNet outperforms traditional centralized multi-agent systems, significantly improving efficiency, adaptability, and scalability in dynamic environments, making it a promising foundation for next-generation autonomous, privacy-respecting multi-agent ecosystems.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces AgentNet, a decentralized framework for LLM-based multi-agent systems. Unlike centralized approaches, AgentNet lets agents specialize dynamically and collaborate via a self-organizing network, routing tasks without predefined workflows. Key features include decentralized coordination, dynamic graph topology, adaptive learning for expertise refinement (using a RAG memory system), and enhanced privacy. This results in improved efficiency, adaptability, and scalability in dynamic environments compared to traditional centralized multi-agent systems.  The paper emphasizes autonomous agent evolution, optimized task coordination, and preservation of privacy as key improvements for LLM-based multi-agent systems.",
  "takeaways": "This paper introduces AgentNet, a decentralized approach to coordinating LLM-based multi-agent systems, offering significant advantages for JavaScript developers building complex web applications.  Here are some practical examples of how its insights can be applied:\n\n**1. Decentralized Collaborative Web Editing:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine a collaborative document editing platform like Google Docs, but powered by multiple specialized LLM agents. One agent could focus on grammar and style, another on fact-checking, a third on suggesting relevant content, and so on.\n* **AgentNet Application:**  Instead of a central server orchestrating all agents, AgentNet's decentralized approach can be implemented using a peer-to-peer library like PeerJS or WebRTC. Each agent, written in JavaScript, runs in the user's browser and communicates directly with other agents.  This removes the server bottleneck and improves responsiveness.  A message broker like MQTT.js could be used to enable efficient communication between agents without direct connections.\n* **Implementation:** Each agent would expose its functionality via a JavaScript API.  The main application logic would use these APIs to integrate the agents' output into the user interface. For example, grammar suggestions from an agent could be displayed as inline annotations, while fact-checking results appear as pop-ups.\n\n**2. Dynamic Content Assembly for Personalized Websites:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  A news website can use multiple LLM agents to personalize content for each user. One agent might specialize in fetching news based on user preferences, another in summarizing articles, and a third in generating related image suggestions.\n* **AgentNet Application:** AgentNet's dynamic task allocation can be implemented using a JavaScript task queue library like BullMQ. Agents subscribe to the queue and dynamically claim tasks based on their expertise, determined by their internal RAG memory. As user preferences change, the agents’ expertise and task assignments will adapt accordingly.\n* **Implementation:** Each agent would be a Node.js service exposing an API.  The frontend (React, Vue, or Angular) would interact with these APIs to assemble the personalized web page.\n\n**3.  Interactive Storytelling with Evolving Narrative:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  A multi-user interactive story where the narrative evolves based on player actions. Each character in the story is controlled by an LLM agent, and their interactions shape the story's direction.\n* **AgentNet Application:** AgentNet’s dynamically evolving graph topology fits perfectly here.  Relationships between character agents can change based on player actions, reflected in real-time changes to the agent network's connections.  This enables more emergent and unpredictable storylines.  Node.js with a graph database like Neo4j could be used to manage the agent network topology.\n* **Implementation:** Player actions could be sent as messages to the relevant agents, using a library like Socket.IO for real-time communication. Agents would process these actions and update their internal states and network connections accordingly, leading to dynamic changes in the game world and story progression.\n\n**4.  Autonomous Web Testing & Debugging:**\n\n* **Scenario:** LLM agents specializing in different aspects of web testing (UI testing, performance testing, security testing) can collaboratively and autonomously test a web application.\n* **AgentNet Application:** AgentNet's adaptive learning mechanism can be used to improve the agents' testing strategies over time.  Successful testing trajectories are stored in their RAG memory, influencing their future actions and leading to more efficient and thorough testing. Puppeteer could be integrated to simulate user interactions and gather data.\n* **Implementation:**  Agents could be implemented as Node.js services, scheduled using a task runner like Jest. Results from each agent are aggregated and presented in a dashboard for developers.\n\n**Key JavaScript Technologies and Libraries:**\n\n* **Communication:** PeerJS, WebRTC, MQTT.js, Socket.IO\n* **Task Management:** BullMQ, task.js\n* **Graph Databases:** Neo4j, graphlib\n* **Browser Automation:** Puppeteer, Playwright\n* **LLM Integration:**  LangChain.js, LlamaIndex.js\n\nBy adopting a decentralized approach and focusing on dynamic evolution, adaptive learning, and task allocation as described in the AgentNet paper, JavaScript developers can build more robust, scalable, and engaging multi-agent web applications. The key takeaway is to move away from centralized coordination and empower individual agents with greater autonomy and learning capabilities, resulting in more intelligent and adaptive web experiences.",

Its purpose is to efficiently distribute and solve a set of tasks using a network of collaborating agents, allowing them to dynamically specialize and adapt over time. The main steps are:\n\n1. **Initialization:** Sets up agents, their initial connections (`edges`), capabilities (`capabilities`), connection weights (`weights`), and memory modules for both routers and executors.\n\n2. **Task Allocation and Processing:** For each incoming task:\n   - It selects an initial agent based on the task's requirements and the agents' current capabilities.\n   - It enters a loop where the current agent decides to either:\n     - **Forward:** Pass the task to another agent.\n     - **Split:** Decompose the task into subtasks and delegate them to other agents.\n     - **Execute:** Solve the task (or a subtask) itself.\n   - This loop continues until the task is fully completed. This uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure implicitly to prevent cycles.\n\n3. **Network Update:** After each task, the connection weights between agents are updated based on their performance and collaboration during the task.  Low-performing connections are pruned. This dynamic topology adaptation enables the network to continuously optimize its structure based on experience.\n\n4. **Agent Capability Update:**  Agent capabilities are adjusted based on the tasks they have performed and their outcomes.  This adaptation allows agents to become specialized in specific domains over time.\n\n\n**Key Improvements over Traditional Multi-Agent Systems:**\n\n- **Decentralization:** No central controller, reducing single points of failure and increasing robustness.\n- **Dynamic Task Allocation:** Agents autonomously decide how to handle tasks, leading to more efficient distribution and specialization.\n- **Adaptive Learning:** Agents continuously refine their capabilities based on experience, improving their performance over time.\n- **Privacy-Preserving:**  Minimizes data sharing between agents, enhancing privacy and security.\n\n\nThis JavaScript implementation provides a more concrete structure, including core functions and data structures, enabling developers to grasp the underlying principles and start experimenting.
