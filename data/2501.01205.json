  "title": "Harnessing Multi-Agent LLMs for Complex Engineering Problem-Solving: A Framework for Senior Design Projects",
  "abstract": "Abstract-Multi-Agent Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining significant attention for their ability to harness collective intelligence in complex problem-solving, decision-making, and planning tasks. This aligns with the concept of the wisdom of crowds, where diverse agents contribute collectively to generating effective solutions, making it particularly suitable for educational settings. Senior design projects, also known as capstone or final year projects, are pivotal in engineering education as they integrate theoretical knowledge with practical application, fostering critical thinking, teamwork, and real-world problem-solving skills. In this paper, we explore the use of Multi-Agent LLMs in supporting these senior design projects undertaken by engineering students, which often involve multidisciplinary considerations and conflicting objectives, such as optimizing technical performance while addressing ethical, social, and environmental concerns. We propose a framework where distinct LLM agents represent different expert perspectives, such as problem formulation agents, system complexity agents, societal and ethical agents, or project managers, thus facilitating a holistic problem-solving approach. This implementation leverages standard multi-agent system (MAS) concepts such as coordination, cooperation, and negotiation, incorporating prompt engineering to develop diverse personas for each agent. These agents engage in rich, collaborative dialogues to simulate human engineering teams, guided by principles from swarm AI to efficiently balance individual contributions towards a unified solution. We adapt these techniques to create a collaboration structure for LLM agents, encouraging interdisciplinary reasoning and negotiation similar to real-world senior design projects. To assess the efficacy of this framework, we collected six proposals of engineering and computer science of typical senior capstone projects and evaluated the performance of Multi-Agent and single-agent LLMs using both custom-designed metrics developed in consultation with engineering faculty and some widely used NLP-based metrics. These metrics cover technical quality, ethical considerations, social impact, and feasibility, ensuring that our evaluation aligns with the educational objectives of engineering design. Our findings suggest that Multi-Agent LLMs can provide a richer, more inclusive problem-solving environment compared to single-agent systems, offering a promising tool for enhancing the educational experience of engineering and computer science students by simulating the complexity and collaboration of real-world engineering and computer science practice. By supporting senior design projects, this tool not only aids in achieving academic excellence but also prepares students for the multifaceted challenges they will face in their professional engineering careers.",
  "summary": "This research explores using a multi-agent system powered by LLMs (like GPT-4) to help engineering students with their complex capstone projects.  The system acts like a virtual team of expert advisors, each focusing on a specific aspect of the project like problem formulation, ethical considerations, or technical feasibility.\n\nKey points for LLM-based multi-agent systems:\n\n* **Role-Playing Agents:** Each LLM agent is given a specific persona (e.g., \"ethical advisor\") to simulate a diverse team of experts.\n* **Centralized Coordination:** A coordinator agent manages tasks and communication between the specialist agents.\n* **Iterative Feedback:** Students receive feedback from the agents and can ask follow-up questions, promoting a dynamic learning process.\n* **Enhanced Learning:**  The system supports collaboration, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills development.\n* **Increased Accuracy:** Multi-agent systems demonstrated better alignment with faculty evaluations compared to single LLM systems.  They provide richer feedback, higher clause density and thematic unity in responses, and readability levels suitable for senior students.\n* **Open-Source Framework:**  The researchers have made their framework open source to encourage further development and adaptation for various educational contexts.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents exciting opportunities for JavaScript developers working with LLM-based multi-agent systems. Let's translate the research into practical examples for web development scenarios:\n\n**1. Building a Collaborative Design Tool:**\n\nImagine a web app for collaborative design (e.g., UI/UX, architecture, software).  You could use a framework like LangChain.js or AutoGen.js to manage the interaction of multiple LLM agents. Each agent could specialize in a particular aspect:\n\n* **\"User Needs Agent\":**  Interprets user stories and translates them into design requirements. This could use natural language processing libraries like compromise.js for text analysis.\n* **\"Aesthetics Agent\":** Suggests design elements and layouts based on aesthetic principles, possibly using a library like three.js for 3D visualization or p5.js for creative coding.\n* **\"Accessibility Agent\":** Ensures design compliance with accessibility guidelines (WCAG).  This could utilize JavaScript libraries that interact with accessibility APIs and testing tools.\n* **\"Technical Feasibility Agent\":** Assesses the technical feasibility of the design, considering constraints of the target platform (web, mobile). This might integrate with existing JavaScript frameworks or APIs relevant to the chosen platform.\n\nThese agents could communicate using a shared message queue (e.g., using Redis and a Node.js backend) or via direct function calls within a JavaScript framework like React or Vue.js. The frontend could display the ongoing \"conversation\" between the agents, allowing users to intervene and provide feedback.\n\n**2.  Creating an Interactive Storytelling Experience:**\n\nConsider building an interactive story where users influence the narrative through their choices.  Multiple LLM agents could play different characters, each with its own personality and motivations:\n\n* **\"Narrator Agent\":** Sets the scene and describes the story's progression.  This could leverage JavaScript text-to-speech libraries or integrate with voice synthesis APIs.\n* **\"Character Agents\":** Respond to user actions and interact with each other, driving the story forward. They can be implemented using libraries like LangChain.js to manage the complexities of character interactions, backstories, and memory.\n* **\"Plot Twist Agent\":**  Introduces unexpected events to keep the story engaging, utilizing random number generation in JavaScript to create unpredictable scenarios.\n\nThe frontend (e.g., React, Vue.js, or even a game engine like Phaser) would present the story's progression, offer choices to the user, and display the characters' dialogue and actions.\n\n**3. Developing a Smart Customer Support System:**\n\nImagine a chatbot that handles complex customer inquiries by routing them to specialized LLM agents:\n\n* **\"Triage Agent\":**  Classifies the customer's issue using natural language processing (e.g., with TensorFlow.js or Brain.js).\n* **\"Technical Support Agent\":**  Provides technical assistance, potentially integrating with a knowledge base API.\n* **\"Billing Agent\":** Handles billing inquiries and processes payments, possibly using JavaScript libraries for secure payment processing.\n* **\"Sales Agent\":** Offers relevant product recommendations and promotions.\n\nThese agents could communicate asynchronously through a message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ) or through a central coordinator agent (as in the paper). The frontend would provide a chat interface for the user to interact with the system.\n\n**Key JavaScript Technologies for Multi-Agent Systems:**\n\n* **LangChain.js/AutoGen.js:** For orchestrating agent interactions and workflows.\n* **TensorFlow.js/Brain.js:** For natural language processing and machine learning tasks within agents.\n* **Node.js with Redis/RabbitMQ:** For backend infrastructure and inter-agent communication.\n* **React/Vue.js/Svelte:** For building dynamic frontends to display agent interactions.\n* **Web Workers:** For parallel processing of agent tasks.\n\n\nBy adopting the core concepts from this paper (specialized agents, coordinator agent, structured communication), JavaScript developers can unlock the potential of LLM-based multi-agent systems to create innovative and intelligent web applications. Remember that ethical considerations, continuous evaluation, and refinement (as emphasized in the paper) are essential for building responsible and effective multi-agent systems.",
