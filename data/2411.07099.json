  "title": "Bounded Rationality Equilibrium Learning in Mean Field Games",
  "abstract": "Abstract\n\nMean field games (MFGs) tractably model behavior in large agent populations. The literature on learning MFG equilibria typically focuses on finding Nash equilibria (NE), which assume perfectly rational agents and are hence implausible in many realistic situations. To overcome these limitations, we incorporate bounded rationality into MFGs by leveraging the well-known concept of quantal response equilibria (QRE). Two novel types of MFG QRE enable the modeling of large agent populations where individuals only noisily estimate the true objective. We also introduce a second source of bounded rationality to MFGs by restricting agents' planning horizon. The resulting novel receding horizon (RH) MFGs are combined with QRE and existing approaches to model different aspects of bounded rationality in MFGs. We formally define MFG QRE and RH MFGs and compare them to existing equilibrium concepts such as entropy-regularized NE. Subsequently, we design generalized fixed point iteration and fictitious play algorithms to learn QRE and RH equilibria. After a theoretical analysis, we give different examples to evaluate the capabilities of our learning algorithms and outline practical differences between the equilibrium concepts.",
  "summary": "This paper explores bounded rationality in Mean Field Games (MFGs), a framework for modeling large agent populations.  It introduces Quantal Response Equilibria (QRE) and Receding Horizon (RH) MFGs, where agents have noisy reward perceptions and limited planning horizons, respectively.  These concepts offer more realistic agent behavior compared to perfect rationality assumptions of Nash Equilibria.  Generalized Fixed Point Iteration and Fictitious Play algorithms are adapted to learn these new equilibria.\n\n\nFor LLM-based multi-agent systems, QRE offers a way to model agents with imperfect understanding derived from noisy LLM outputs.  RH-MFGs address limited context windows and computational constraints by focusing on short-term planning, similar to how LLMs operate with token limits.  The adapted learning algorithms provide practical tools for training and deploying such systems.",
  "takeaways": "This paper introduces the concepts of Quantal Response Equilibria (QRE) and Receding Horizon (RH) within the context of Mean Field Games (MFGs) to model bounded rationality in multi-agent systems. Let's explore how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights to LLM-based multi-agent projects, focusing on web development scenarios:\n\n**1. Simulating Bounded Rationality with LLMs:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Building a multi-agent chatbot system for customer service where agents have varying levels of expertise or access to information.\n* **Application:** Instead of assuming perfect rationality (Nash Equilibrium), model agents using QRE.  Introduce noise into the LLM's output probabilities (e.g., temperature scaling, top-p sampling). This simulates agents misinterpreting customer queries or having incomplete knowledge, leading to more realistic and diverse chatbot behaviors.  \n* **Code Example (Conceptual using a hypothetical LLM library):**\n\n```javascript\n// Assuming 'llm' is an LLM object\nasync function getChatbotResponse(query, agentExpertiseLevel) {\n  const response = await llm.generate(query, {\n    temperature: 1 / agentExpertiseLevel // Higher expertise, lower temperature (less noise)\n  });\n  return response.text;\n}\n```\n\n**2. Receding Horizon Planning with LLMs:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Developing a collaborative writing tool where multiple LLM-powered agents contribute to a document.\n* **Application:** Implement RH by limiting the context window of each LLM agent. This simulates agents focusing on the immediate text surrounding their current contribution rather than the entire document. This can improve performance and reduce computational costs while maintaining coherence over shorter segments.\n* **Code Example (Conceptual):**\n\n```javascript\n// 'document' is the current document text\n// 'agentContextWindow' is the size of the context window\nfunction getAgentContext(currentPosition, agentContextWindow) {\n  const start = Math.max(0, currentPosition - agentContextWindow / 2);\n  const end = Math.min(document.length, currentPosition + agentContextWindow / 2);\n  return document.substring(start, end);\n}\n\nasync function getAgentContribution(context) {\n  const contribution = await llm.generate(context, { /* ... other parameters */ });\n  return contribution.text;\n}\n```\n\n**3. Combining QRE and RH:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Creating a real-time strategy game where LLM agents control units with limited vision and reaction time.\n* **Application:** Combine QRE and RH to model agents with both imperfect decision-making (QRE through noisy LLM outputs) and limited planning horizons (RH through restricted game state information). This creates more believable and challenging opponents.\n\n**4. Generalized Fictitious Play (GFP) for LLM Training:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Training a team of LLM agents for a complex task, like coordinating deliveries in a dynamic environment.\n* **Application:** Adapt the GFP algorithm for training by iteratively updating the agents' policies based on their interactions with the environment and other agents. The weighted averaging in GFP can stabilize learning and improve convergence to a more robust equilibrium.\n* **Libraries:** Consider using TensorFlow.js or other machine learning libraries for implementing GFP within a web-based training environment.\n\n**5. Visualization and Experimentation:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Exploring the impact of different noise levels (QRE) and horizon lengths (RH) on agent behavior.\n* **Application:** Develop web-based dashboards using libraries like D3.js or Chart.js to visualize agent interactions and performance metrics. These dashboards can be interactive, allowing users to adjust parameters and observe the resulting changes in equilibrium behavior.\n\n**Key JavaScript Considerations:**\n\n* **Asynchronous Programming:** Working with LLMs involves asynchronous operations. Use `async/await` and promises effectively.\n* **Web Workers:** Offload computationally intensive LLM operations to web workers to prevent blocking the main thread.\n* **Client-Server Architecture:**  Design a suitable client-server architecture for handling LLM interactions and distributing computations.\n* **WebSocket:** Use WebSockets for real-time communication between agents in multi-agent scenarios.\n\n\nBy leveraging these JavaScript tools and techniques, developers can translate the theoretical concepts presented in the paper into practical, functioning LLM-based multi-agent applications within web development contexts. This opens up exciting possibilities for creating more realistic, robust, and scalable AI-powered web experiences.",

MFGs model the behavior of a large number of interacting agents.  The equilibria represent stable states where no agent has an incentive to deviate from its current strategy, given the actions of all other agents.\n\n* **GFPI (Generalized Fixed Point Iteration):** This is a basic iterative algorithm that repeatedly updates the policy based on the current mean field.  Convergence is not guaranteed for all MFGs or all temperature parameters (alpha).\n\n* **GFP (Generalized Fictitious Play):**  This algorithm maintains a weighted average of past policies and updates the current policy based on the best response to the average mean field.  It tends to be more robust to convergence issues than GFPI.\n\n* **Sequential RH-GFP (Sequential Receding Horizon GFP):** This algorithm incorporates a receding horizon approach, meaning that agents only plan their actions for a limited number of steps into the future (the `horizon` parameter).  It solves a sequence of smaller MFGs, using the result of each as the initial condition for the next.\n\n* **Parallel RH-GFP (Parallel Receding Horizon GFP):** Similar to Sequential RH-GFP, but computes the smaller MFGs in parallel, offering potential performance improvements.\n\nThese JavaScript implementations provide a structural outline. The helper functions (`gamma_M`, `q_star`, `bestResponse`, `softmax`, etc.) would contain the core MFG logic, which depends on the specific game being modeled (e.g., state transitions, rewards).  The code assumes discrete state and action spaces and a finite time horizon.  Adapting it for continuous settings or infinite horizons would require further modifications.",
