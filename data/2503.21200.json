  "title": "LEARNING GENERALIZABLE SKILLS FROM OFFLINE MULTI-TASK DATA FOR MULTI-AGENT COOPERATION",
  "abstract": "Learning cooperative multi-agent policy from offline multi-task data that can generalize to unseen tasks with varying numbers of agents and targets is an attractive problem in many scenarios. Although aggregating general behavior patterns among multiple tasks as skills to improve policy transfer is a promising approach, two primary challenges hinder the further advancement of skill learning in offline multi-task MARL. Firstly, extracting general cooperative behaviors from various action sequences as common skills lacks bringing cooperative temporal knowledge into them. Secondly, existing works only involve common skills and can not adaptively choose independent knowledge as task-specific skills in each task for fine-grained action execution. To tackle these challenges, we propose Hierarchical and Separate Skill Discovery (HiSSD), a novel approach for generalizable offline multi-task MARL through skill learning. HiSSD leverages a hierarchical framework that jointly learns common and task-specific skills. The common skills learn cooperative temporal knowledge and enable in-sample exploration for offline multi-task MARL. The task-specific skills represent the priors of each task and achieve a task-guided fine-grained action execution. To verify the advancement of our method, we conduct experiments on multi-agent MuJoCo and SMAC benchmarks. After training the policy using HiSSD on offline multi-task data, the empirical results show that HiSSD assigns effective cooperative behaviors and obtains superior performance in unseen tasks.

  "summary": "This paper introduces HiSSD (Hierarchical and Separate Skill Discovery), a new method for training AI agents to cooperate in complex tasks across different scenarios (varying numbers of agents and targets) using previously collected data (offline multi-task learning). HiSSD improves upon existing methods by teaching agents both general cooperative strategies (common skills) and task-specific adaptations (task-specific skills). This hierarchical approach allows for more efficient transfer of learned knowledge to new, unseen tasks.\n\nFor LLM-based multi-agent systems, HiSSD offers a potential pathway for training LLMs to collaborate effectively in various applications by learning both general communication/cooperation skills and how to adapt these skills to specific task requirements. This hierarchical skill learning could improve the efficiency and adaptability of multi-agent LLM systems in complex environments.  The concept of separating common and task-specific knowledge is particularly relevant when considering the prompting of LLMs, suggesting a framework for building both baseline collaborative abilities and injecting specialized knowledge for different tasks.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents HiSSD, a hierarchical skill learning framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) from offline, multi-task data. Here are practical examples of how JavaScript developers can apply these insights in LLM-based multi-agent applications:\n\n**1. Collaborative Content Creation:**\n\nImagine building a web app where multiple LLM agents collaborate to write a story. Each agent has a specific role (e.g., plot developer, character designer, dialogue writer). HiSSD's hierarchical skill learning can be applied here.\n\n* **Common Skills (High-Level Planner):** Implemented using a central LLM, these skills represent general collaborative behaviors, such as maintaining story coherence, managing plot progression, ensuring character consistency. A JavaScript library like LangChain can be used to orchestrate calls to this central LLM.\n\n* **Task-Specific Skills (Low-Level Controller):**  Individual LLMs (agents) possess specialized skills. The plot developer agent uses skills like \"create plot twist,\" the character designer uses \"develop character backstory,\" and the dialogue writer uses \"write witty banter.\" These can be implemented using prompt engineering techniques within individual agent functions in JavaScript.\n\n* **Web App Implementation:** A frontend framework like React could manage user interaction and display the generated story. Node.js and Express.js can handle backend logic, agent communication, and interactions with the central LLM.  WebSockets might be used for real-time interaction between agents and the display of the evolving story.\n\n**2. Multi-Agent Customer Support Chatbot System:**\n\nA website could use multiple specialized LLM chatbots to handle different customer queries.\n\n* **Common Skills:**  These could include general customer service skills, like greeting customers, extracting key information from their queries, escalating complex issues to human operators.  Again, a central LLM orchestrated using a library like LangChain could manage these common skills.\n\n* **Task-Specific Skills:** Individual chatbots would have specializations, like \"handling billing inquiries,\" \"answering technical questions,\" or \"processing returns.\"  These would be implemented through fine-tuned prompts and potentially fine-tuned smaller LLMs deployed using a serverless platform like Vercel or Netlify Functions for scalability and ease of management in JavaScript.\n\n* **Web App Implementation:** The frontend could be a chat interface built with React, Vue.js, or similar. The backend would use Node.js and a library like Socket.IO for real-time communication, routing incoming messages to the appropriate specialized chatbot.\n\n**3. Collaborative Game Development with LLMs:**\n\nLLM agents could work together to generate game content, such as level designs, character dialogues, and storylines.\n\n* **Common Skills:** These skills could include understanding game design principles, maintaining game balance, ensuring consistency within the game world.\n\n* **Task-Specific Skills:**  Agents could specialize in \"generating level layouts,\" \"creating compelling character backstories,\" or \"writing branching dialogues.\"\n\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**  Three.js or Babylon.js could be used for rendering and visualizing the generated game content in the browser.  Node.js can handle server-side logic and manage the interaction between different LLM agents.\n\n\n**Key JavaScript Considerations:**\n\n* **LLM Interaction Libraries:** Use libraries like LangChain to facilitate interactions with LLMs.\n* **Agent Frameworks:** Consider using agent frameworks or building custom solutions with libraries like Socket.IO for inter-agent communication and message passing.\n* **Asynchronous Programming:**  Multi-agent systems often require asynchronous programming to handle concurrent operations. Use JavaScript's `async/await` and Promises.\n* **Serverless Functions:** Deploying individual agent logic as serverless functions (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions) can enhance scalability and simplify deployment in the JavaScript ecosystem.\n\n\nBy adapting the HiSSD framework and applying these JavaScript implementation techniques, developers can unlock new possibilities in creating sophisticated LLM-based multi-agent web applications.  Remember to consider the ethical implications and potential biases of using LLMs in these collaborative scenarios.",

Its core idea is to learn both *common* and *task-specific* skills from a dataset of interactions from multiple related MARL tasks.  This allows the agents to generalize better to unseen tasks within the same domain.\n\n**Key Components and their Functions:**\n\n1. **High-Level Planner:** This component learns *common skills* which are general cooperative behaviors useful across various tasks.  It uses a common skill encoder (πθh) to extract these skills from agent observations. A forward predictor (fϕ) uses the common skills to predict the next global state, encouraging the agent to consider long-term consequences.\n\n2. **Low-Level Controller:** This component learns *task-specific skills*  that are unique to each task and help fine-tune the agent's actions. It uses a task-specific skill encoder (gω) for this purpose. An action decoder (πθl) then combines the observations, common skills, and task-specific skills to generate the agent's actions.\n\n3. **Value Network:** A value network (Vtot) estimates the cumulative reward from a given state. This is trained using an Implicit Q-learning objective to handle the off-policy nature of the offline learning setting.\n\n4. **Training:** The algorithm is trained in an offline manner, meaning it doesn't interact with the environment during training. It uses the pre-collected offline dataset (DT) which contains data from multiple tasks.\n\n5. **Execution:** During execution (testing on a new task), the agent only uses its local observation.  The high-level planner produces common skills, the low-level controller generates task-specific skills, and the action decoder combines these with the observation to decide the actions.\n\n\n**Purpose of HiSSD:**\n\nThe primary goal of HiSSD is to improve the *generalization* of multi-agent policies trained offline.  By learning reusable common skills and adaptable task-specific skills, the agents can perform better in new, unseen tasks without requiring additional training or online interaction.  This is particularly important in real-world scenarios where online interaction can be expensive or dangerous.",
