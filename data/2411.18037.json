  "title": "NORMATIVE FEELING: SOCIALLY PATTERNED AFFECTIVE MECHANISMS\nHow Social Maintenance Shapes the Evolution of Affective Disposition",
  "abstract": "Norms and the normative processes that enforce them such as social maintenance are considered fundamental building blocks of human societies, shaping many aspects of our cognition. However, emerging work argues that the building blocks of normativity emerged much earlier in evolution than previously considered. In light of this, we argue that normative processes must be taken into account to consider the evolution of even ancient processes such as affect. We show through an agent-based model (with an evolvable model of affect) that different affective dispositions emerge when taking into account social maintenance. In this paper we demonstrate that social maintenance results in the emergence of a minimal population regulation mechanism in a dynamic environment, without the need to predict the state of the environment or reason about the mental state of others. We use a cultural interpretation of our model to derive a new definition of norm emergence which distinguishes between indirect and direct social maintenance. Indirect social maintenance tends to one equilibrium (similar to environmental scaffolding) and the richer direct social maintenance results in many possible equilibria in behaviour, capturing an important aspect of normative behaviour in that it bears a certain degree of arbitrariness. We also distinguish between single-variable and mechanistic normative regularities. A mechanistic regularity rather than a particular behaviour specified by one value e.g. walking speed, its a collection of values that specify a culturally patterned version of a psychological mechanism e.g. a disposition. This is how culture reprograms entire cognitive and physiological systems.",
  "summary": "This research explores how social norms, specifically punishment for exceeding resource consumption limits, influence the evolution of simulated agents' affective systems (analogous to emotions) and their resource consumption behavior. Agents with evolvable \"mood\" systems were placed in a resource-constrained environment, where they could either be punished for selfish resource grabbing or not be punished.  The key findings are:\n\n1. **Social Pressure Shapes AI \"Emotions\":** When punishment was enabled, agents evolved different affective responses compared to those without punishment. They developed a tendency to consume more when \"happy\" (experiencing net energy gain) and less when \"unhappy\" (experiencing net energy loss, often due to punishment), correlating mood with social feedback. This learned behavior promotes resource availability and population stability within the simulation.\n\n\n2. **Emergent Population Control:**  This seemingly counterintuitive \"mood-driven\" behavior is actually a form of emergent population control. Agents restrain their consumption when resources are scarce, mitigating the \"tragedy of the commons\". This emergent coordination arises without explicit programming or complex cognitive abilities like foresight.\n\n\n3. **Relevance to LLMs:** The research suggests that incorporating social feedback mechanisms, analogous to punishment and reward, could shape LLM agent behavior in multi-agent environments, promoting cooperation and stability without extensive individual agent programming. The concept of evolving internal states, like \"mood\", influenced by social pressures, offers a potential direction for building more robust and adaptable LLM-based multi-agent systems.  This also suggests a new perspective on mechanistic norms, where norms are distributed across multiple parameters of a model, potentially impacting LLM prompt engineering strategies.",
  "takeaways": "This paper explores how social maintenance (reward/punishment) influences the evolution of affect and behavior in agents, leading to the emergence of norms and, interestingly, population control mechanisms. Here's how a JavaScript developer working with LLM-based multi-agent systems can apply these insights:\n\n**1. Modelling Affect in Multi-Agent Web Apps:**\n\n* **Mood as a State Variable:** Represent an LLM agent's \"mood\" as a numerical value within your JavaScript code. This value can be influenced by various stimuli (events in the web application), mirroring the paper's concept of \"disposition.\"\n* **Example (using Node.js and a hypothetical 'Agent' class):**\n\n```javascript\nclass Agent {\n  constructor(llm) {\n    this.llm = llm;\n    this.mood = 0.5; // Initial mood\n    this.disposition = {\n      taskCompletion: 0.8, // How task completion affects mood\n      socialInteraction: 0.5, // How interactions affect mood\n      punishment: -0.7, // How punishment affects mood\n      // ... other stimuli\n    };\n  }\n\n  updateMood(event) {\n    if (event.type === 'taskCompleted') {\n      this.mood += event.value * this.disposition.taskCompletion;\n    } else if (event.type === 'punished') {\n      this.mood += event.value * this.disposition.punishment;\n    }\n    // ... other event types\n    this.mood = Math.max(0, Math.min(1, this.mood)); // Keep mood between 0 and 1\n  }\n\n  act() {\n     // Use mood to influence LLM prompt generation \n     let prompt = `You are an agent with mood ${this.mood}. `\n     if(this.mood > 0.7){\n        prompt += \"You are feeling optimistic. \"\n     } else if(this.mood < 0.3){\n        prompt += \"You are feeling pessimistic. \"\n     }\n     prompt +=  \"Your task is to ... \" //  Rest of the prompt \n\n     return this.llm(prompt)\n  }\n\n}\n```\n\n* **Stimuli and Weights:** Define stimuli relevant to your web app (e.g., user feedback, task completion, interaction with other agents).  The paper's core idea is that these stimuli have \"weights\" (how strongly they affect mood) which can be learned or adjusted dynamically.\n\n\n**2. Implementing Social Maintenance:**\n\n* **Reward and Punishment System:**  Create a system for rewarding and punishing agents based on their actions. This could involve modifying their mood, access to resources (like API calls or processing time), or their status within the multi-agent system.\n* **Example:** If an agent provides incorrect information or acts selfishly (e.g., hogs resources), other agents (or a central authority) could issue a punishment, decreasing the offending agent's mood.  Conversely, positive actions could increase mood.\n* **Framework Integration:**  Integrate this reward/punishment system with your chosen JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Vue, Angular) so that front-end interactions can trigger these mechanisms.\n\n**3. Norm Emergence:**\n\n* **Observing Patterns:**  Log agent behaviors and mood changes over time. Analyze these logs to identify emerging patterns or \"norms\" (stable and consistent behavioral patterns across multiple agents). This could be done using server-side JavaScript with Node.js and libraries for data analysis like Pandas.js.\n* **Visualizing Norms:**  Use JavaScript charting libraries (e.g., Chart.js, D3.js) to visualize these patterns and help understand how social maintenance shapes agent behavior in your web application.\n\n**4. Population Control (Resource Management):**\n\n* **Resource Allocation:** The paper demonstrates how social maintenance can indirectly lead to population control. In a web context, this translates to managing resources.  Agents with lower \"mood\" (perhaps due to previous punishments for inefficient resource usage) could be allocated fewer resources or have lower priority access.\n* **Dynamic Scaling:** Monitor resource usage and dynamically adjust the number of active agents or their resource allocation based on the overall system load and emerging agent behaviors.  This could be achieved using serverless functions and cloud-based scaling solutions.\n\n**5. Experimentation and Libraries:**\n\n* **Langchain.js**:  For interacting with and managing multiple LLMs, Langchain.js provides valuable tools.  You can use it to implement the agent architecture described above and incorporate the mood/disposition mechanism.\n* **Petri Nets or State Machines:**  Model complex agent interactions and state transitions using libraries like `petri-net-js` or state machine libraries for JavaScript. These can be particularly useful for visualizing and analyzing the dynamics of social maintenance and norm emergence.\n* **Agent-Based Modeling Libraries**: JavaScript libraries like `agent-base` can be used for more complex agent-based simulations within your web development workflow.\n\n\nBy implementing these concepts, you can create more robust, adaptable, and potentially even self-regulating LLM-based multi-agent systems within your web applications. This opens exciting possibilities for developing innovative web experiences that leverage the power of multi-agent AI.",
  "pseudocode": "No pseudocode block found. However, the paper contains mathematical formulas that can be translated into JavaScript. These formulas describe the agent's mood and how it affects their behavior:\n\n**Equation (1): Mood Change**\n\n```javascript\nfunction calculateMoodChange(stimuli, weights) {\n  let moodChange = 0;\n  for (let i = 0; i < stimuli.length; i++) {\n    moodChange += stimuli[i] * weights[i];\n  }\n  return moodChange;\n}\n```\n\n* **Explanation:** This function calculates how much the agent's mood changes in a given time step. It takes an array of `stimuli` (e.g., hunger, injury, seeing others punished) and an array of corresponding `weights` (representing the dispositional influence of each stimulus) as input. It iterates through the stimuli, multiplying each stimulus by its weight and adding the result to the total `moodChange`.\n\n**Equation (2): Mood Update**\n\n```javascript\nfunction updateMood(currentMood, moodDecayRate, moodChange, alpha, beta) {\n  const newMood = (currentMood * moodDecayRate + moodChange* alpha) * beta ;\n  return newMood;\n}\n```\n\n* **Explanation:**  This function updates the agent's mood from one time step to the next. It takes the `currentMood`, the `moodDecayRate` (how quickly the mood returns to a baseline), the `moodChange` calculated in the previous function, and parameters `alpha` (how much stimuli affect disposition) and `beta` as input. The formula models the decay of the current mood and the incorporation of the mood change. It calculates the new mood using a decay factor and a scaling factor determined by `alpha` and `beta`.\n\n**Equation (3): Behavior Modulation**\n\n```javascript\nfunction modulateBehavior(baseBehavior, mood, weight) {\n  const modulatedBehavior = baseBehavior + (mood * weight);\n  return modulatedBehavior;\n}\n```\n\n* **Explanation:**  This function modulates an agent's base behavior (e.g., how much resource to consume, how likely to punish) based on its current mood. It takes the `baseBehavior`, the current `mood`, and a `weight` (representing the dispositional influence of mood on that behavior) as input. It calculates the `modulatedBehavior` by adding the mood scaled by a weight to the base behavior.\n\n\nThese JavaScript functions provide a direct implementation of the formulas presented in the paper, allowing developers to experiment with and simulate the mood and behavior dynamics of agents in a multi-agent system. They form the core of the agent's affective mechanism and its influence on actions within the simulated environment.  Note that variables such as the stimuli array values, weights, alpha, beta, mood decay rate, and the initial mood value will need to be initialized or obtained from the simulation environment based on the specifications in the research paper.",
