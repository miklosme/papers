  "title": "Toward Super Agent System with Hybrid AI Routers",
  "abstract": "AI Agents powered by Large Language Models are transforming the world through enormous applications. A super agent has the potential to fulfill diverse user needs, such as summarization, coding, and research, by accurately understanding user intent and leveraging the appropriate tools to solve tasks. However, to make such an agent viable for real-world deployment and accessible at scale, significant optimizations are required to ensure high efficiency and low cost. This paper presents a design of the Super Agent System. Upon receiving a user prompt, the system first detects the intent of the user, then routes the request to specialized task agents with the necessary tools or automatically generates agentic workflows. In practice, most applications directly serve as AI assistants on edge devices such as phones and robots. As different language models vary in capability and cloud-based models often entail high computational costs, latency, and privacy concerns, we then explore the hybrid mode where the router dynamically selects between local and cloud models based on task complexity. Finally, we introduce the blueprint of an on-device super agent enhanced with cloud. With advances in multi-modality models and edge hardware, we envision that most computations can be handled locally, with cloud collaboration only as needed. Such architecture paves the way for super agents to be seamlessly integrated into everyday life in the near future.",
  "summary": "This paper proposes a \"Super Agent System\" architecture designed to improve the efficiency and scalability of AI agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).  The system breaks down complex user requests into smaller tasks handled by specialized agents, which utilize tools, memory, and external resources.  A key aspect is a hybrid approach that uses both on-device Small Language Models (SLMs) for quick, privacy-preserving responses and cloud-based LLMs for more complex tasks. The system dynamically routes tasks and selects appropriate LLMs based on task complexity and cost considerations using \"intent routing\" and \"model routing\".  Automated agentic workflows allow multiple agents to collaborate on complex tasks.  The authors propose this architecture as a blueprint for integrating super agents into everyday devices like phones and robots.",
  "takeaways": "This paper outlines a sophisticated architecture for a Super Agent System, and while it doesn't provide explicit JavaScript code, its core concepts can be translated into practical implementations for web developers working with LLMs and multi-agent systems. Here are some examples:\n\n**1. Intent Router Implementation using LangChain and a Lightweight LLM:**\n\n```javascript\n// Using LangChain (adapt for other LLM libraries)\nimport { LLMChain } from \"langchain\";\nimport { ChatOpenAI } from \"langchain/chat_models/openai\";\nimport { PromptTemplate } from \"langchain/prompts\";\n\nconst availableAgents = [\n  { name: \"chatAgent\", description: \"Handles general conversation.\" },\n  { name: \"financeAgent\", description: \"Performs financial calculations.\" },\n  { name: \"codeAgent\", description: \"Generates code snippets.\" },\n];\n\nconst template = `You are an intent router. Given a user prompt and a list of available agents, select the most appropriate agent.\nRespond with a JSON object containing the 'name' of the chosen agent.\nUser Prompt: {userPrompt}\nAvailable Agents: {availableAgents}\n`;\n\nconst prompt = new PromptTemplate({\n  template,\n  inputVariables: [\"userPrompt\", \"availableAgents\"],\n});\n\nconst model = new ChatOpenAI({ temperature: 0, modelName: \"gpt-3.5-turbo\" }); // Use a lightweight LLM\nconst chain = new LLMChain({ llm: model, prompt });\n\nconst userPrompt = \"Calculate compound interest for $1000 over 5 years at 5%.\";\n\nchain.call({ userPrompt, availableAgents: JSON.stringify(availableAgents) }).then((res) => {\n  const selectedAgent = JSON.parse(res.text).name;\n  console.log(\"Selected Agent:\", selectedAgent); // Expected: financeAgent\n  // Now call the appropriate agent based on 'selectedAgent'\n});\n\n```\nThis example demonstrates intent routing using function calls.  It utilizes LangChain for managing the LLM interaction, showcasing how a developer could integrate a lightweight LLM like GPT-3.5-turbo for efficient intent detection.  The `availableAgents` array provides a structured way to define agent capabilities.\n\n\n**2.  Agentic Workflow with LangChain:**\n\n```javascript\nimport { SerpAPI } from \"langchain/tools\";\nimport { Calculator } from \"langchain/tools/calculator\";\nimport { ChatOpenAI } from \"langchain/chat_models/openai\";\nimport { initializeAgentExecutorWithOptions } from \"langchain/agents\";\n\nconst tools = [new SerpAPI(), new Calculator()];\nconst model = new ChatOpenAI({ temperature: 0 });\nconst executor = initializeAgentExecutorWithOptions(tools, model, { agentType: \"zero-shot-react-description\" });\n\nconst userPrompt = \"What is the weather in London today, and multiply that temperature by 2?\";\n\nexecutor.call({ input: userPrompt }).then((res) => {\n  console.log(res);\n});\n```\nLeveraging LangChain, this snippet illustrates a basic agentic workflow integrating tools like a search engine (SerpAPI) and a calculator.  The `zero-shot-react-description` agent allows chaining tool usage based on the LLM's understanding of the prompt, showcasing a simple multi-step task execution.\n\n\n**3.  Dynamic Model Routing based on Task Complexity (Conceptual):**\n\n```javascript\n// Conceptual Example â€“ Requires implementation with your LLM provider\nasync function routeTask(userPrompt) {\n  const complexityScore = await assessComplexity(userPrompt); // Function to estimate complexity\n  let selectedModel;\n\n  if (complexityScore > 0.8) {\n    selectedModel = \"gpt-4\"; // High complexity, use powerful model\n  } else if (complexityScore > 0.5) {\n    selectedModel = \"gpt-3.5-turbo\"; // Medium complexity\n  } else {\n    selectedModel = \"onDeviceModel\"; // Low complexity, use local model\n  }\n\n  // Use the selectedModel for the task\n  return await executeTask(userPrompt, selectedModel);\n}\n\n// Placeholder functions\nasync function assessComplexity(prompt) {\n    // Implement logic to estimate prompt complexity.  Could involve prompt length, keyword analysis, etc.\n    return Math.random(); // Replace with actual complexity assessment\n}\n\nasync function executeTask(prompt, model){\n    // Implement logic to execute the task using the selected model.\n    return \"Task executed with \" + model;\n}\n\n\nrouteTask(\"What is the meaning of life?\").then(console.log); // Might use gpt-4\nrouteTask(\"Summarize this short text\").then(console.log);  // Might use gpt-3.5-turbo or onDeviceModel\n```\nThis conceptual example demonstrates how to implement dynamic model selection based on estimated complexity. You'd need to replace placeholders with functions that assess complexity (e.g., using prompt length, keyword analysis) and execute tasks using different LLMs.\n\n\n**4.  Edge/Cloud Routing with Local Models (Conceptual):**\n\nThis would involve integrating a local, lightweight LLM into the browser (e.g., using WebAssembly).  The JavaScript code would first attempt to execute the task locally.  If the local model's confidence is below a threshold or the task requires external resources, route it to a cloud-based LLM.\n\nThese examples provide a starting point for JavaScript developers to experiment with the Super Agent System concepts.  Remember to adapt the code to your chosen LLM provider, frameworks, and specific project requirements. Key libraries like LangChain are invaluable for managing these complex multi-agent systems.  The paper's emphasis on efficiency and cost should be a primary consideration when making implementation decisions.",
