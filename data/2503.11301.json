  "title": "GNNs as Predictors of Agentic Workflow Performances",
  "abstract": "Agentic workflows invoked by Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in handling complex tasks. However, optimizing such workflows is costly and inefficient in real-world applications due to extensive invocations of LLMs. To fill this gap, this position paper formulates agentic workflows as computational graphs and advocates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as efficient predictors of agentic workflow performances, avoiding repeated LLM invocations for evaluation. To empirically ground this position, we construct FLORA-Bench, a unified platform for benchmarking GNNs for predicting agentic workflow performances. With extensive experiments, we arrive at the following conclusion: GNNs are simple yet effective predictors. This conclusion supports new applications of GNNs and a novel direction towards automating agentic workflow optimization. All codes, models, and data are available at this URL.",
  "summary": "This paper proposes using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to predict the performance of workflows in multi-agent AI systems.  This avoids the cost of repeatedly running the workflow with LLMs for evaluation during optimization.  A new benchmark, FLORA-Bench, is introduced to evaluate this approach.  Experiments demonstrate that GNNs can effectively predict workflow performance, are robust to changes in the driving LLM, and significantly speed up workflow optimization, although generalization across different task domains needs improvement.  The key point for LLM-based multi-agent systems is that GNNs offer a faster, more efficient way to optimize complex agent workflows compared to relying solely on LLM evaluations.",
  "takeaways": "This research paper proposes using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to predict the performance of LLM-based multi-agent workflows, eliminating the need for costly and time-consuming LLM calls during optimization.  Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights:\n\n**Scenario:** Imagine building a multi-agent web application for collaborative document editing. Each agent has a specific role (e.g., grammar checker, style editor, fact-checker) and interacts with the document based on its role and the actions of other agents.  Optimizing this workflow for speed and accuracy is crucial.\n\n**Applying the Research:**\n\n1. **Representing the Workflow:**  Model the agentic workflow as a graph using a JavaScript library like `vis-network` or `sigma.js`. Each agent becomes a node, and edges represent dependencies between agents.  Node attributes can store the agent's role and system prompt.  \n\n   ```javascript\n   // Example using vis-network\n   const nodes = new vis.DataSet([\n       { id: 1, label: 'Grammar Checker', prompt: 'Check grammar and spelling' },\n       { id: 2, label: 'Style Editor', prompt: 'Ensure consistent style' },\n       { id: 3, label: 'Fact Checker', prompt: 'Verify facts and citations' },\n   ]);\n\n   const edges = new vis.DataSet([\n       { from: 1, to: 2 }, // Grammar check before style edit\n       { from: 2, to: 3 }, // Style edit before fact check\n   ]);\n\n   const data = { nodes, edges };\n   const network = new vis.Network(container, data, options);\n   ```\n\n2. **Generating Features:**  Use a JavaScript implementation of a sentence transformer library like `transformers.js` or a similar library to convert the agent prompts into numerical vectors.  These vectors serve as node features for the GNN.\n\n   ```javascript\n   // Example using a hypothetical transformers.js API\n   async function generateFeatures(prompt) {\n       const model = await transformers.load('sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2');\n       const embeddings = await model.embed(prompt);\n       return embeddings;\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Implementing the GNN:** Use a JavaScript GNN library like `deeplearn.js` (now TensorFlow.js), `webdnn`, or a dedicated GNN library if one emerges.  Train the GNN on a dataset of workflows and their corresponding performance metrics (accuracy, speed). This data would need to be gathered initially by running the actual LLM-based agents, as described in the paper.\n\n   ```javascript\n   // Example using a hypothetical GNN library\n   const gnn = new GNN({ layers: 2, hiddenUnits: 64 });\n   gnn.train(workflowGraphs, performanceMetrics);\n   const predictedPerformance = gnn.predict(newWorkflowGraph);\n   ```\n\n4. **Integrating with a Frontend Framework:** Integrate the visualization and prediction components into your web application using React, Vue, or Angular.  Provide a user interface to modify the workflow graph and see the GNN's predicted performance in real-time.\n\n5. **Optimization Loop:**  Use a genetic algorithm or other optimization method in JavaScript to evolve the workflow graph (add/remove agents, change connections, refine prompts).  Use the GNN as a fitness function â€“ higher predicted performance equals better fitness. This avoids calling the LLMs for every iteration of the optimization process.\n\n**Benefits for Web Developers:**\n\n* **Reduced LLM Costs:** Significantly cut down on the costs and latency associated with calling LLMs during workflow optimization.\n* **Faster Iteration:**  Quickly experiment with different workflow designs and get immediate feedback on their potential performance.\n* **Improved User Experience:** Optimize workflows for better performance, resulting in faster and more accurate multi-agent applications.\n\n**Challenges:**\n\n* **Dataset Creation:** Initially, you need a labeled dataset of workflows and their actual performance, which requires running the LLM-based agents.\n* **GNN in JavaScript:**  While JavaScript libraries for GNNs exist, they may not be as mature as those in Python.  This might require more effort in implementation and fine-tuning.\n\nThis paper opens up exciting possibilities for building efficient and complex multi-agent web applications.  By leveraging GNNs, JavaScript developers can create more intelligent and interactive user experiences.",
  "pseudocode": "Here are the JavaScript versions of the pseudocode-like algorithms described in the paper, along with explanations of their purpose:\n\n**1. Agent Output Calculation (Equation 1 & 2):**\n\n```javascript\nclass Agent {\n  constructor(llm, prompt) {\n    this.llm = llm; // The LLM instance (e.g., a wrapper around an LLM API)\n    this.prompt = prompt;\n  }\n\n  getOutput(taskInstruction, predecessorOutputs) {\n    const input = [taskInstruction, ...predecessorOutputs]; // Concatenate inputs\n    const output = this.llm.query(input.join('\\n'), this.prompt); // Query the LLM\n    return output;\n  }\n}\n\n\nfunction executeWorkflow(workflow, taskInstruction) {\n  const agentOutputs = {};\n  // Topological sort not explicitly implemented here, but is crucial in real implementations.\n  // Assumed workflow.agents is already topologically sorted.\n  for (const agent of workflow.agents) {\n    const predecessorOutputs = workflow.predecessors(agent.id).map(predId => agentOutputs[predId]);\n    agentOutputs[agent.id] = agent.getOutput(taskInstruction, predecessorOutputs);\n  }\n  return agentOutputs[workflow.finalAgentId]; // Return the output of the last agent.\n}\n\n\n// Example usage (simplified):\nconst workflow = {\n  agents: [\n    new Agent(mockLLM, \"Prompt 1\"),\n    new Agent(mockLLM, \"Prompt 2\"),\n    // ...more agents\n  ],\n  predecessors: (agentId) => { /* Return an array of predecessor agent IDs */ },\n  finalAgentId: /* ID of the last agent in the workflow */\n};\nconst task = \"Some task instruction\";\nconst result = executeWorkflow(workflow, task);\n\n// Mock LLM for demonstration (replace with actual LLM interface):\nconst mockLLM = {\n  query: (input, prompt) => `LLM response to: ${input} with prompt: ${prompt}`\n};\n\nconsole.log(result);\n```\n\n* **Purpose:** This code demonstrates how an agentic workflow can be executed.  It defines an `Agent` class that uses an LLM to generate outputs based on inputs and prompts.  The `executeWorkflow` function orchestrates the agent interaction by passing outputs between agents based on the workflow's defined structure (represented by the `predecessors` and `finalAgentId` properties in this simplified example). It is crucial to ensure that the agents are processed in the correct topological order based on their dependencies within the DAG, which isn't explicitly included in the example for simplicity.\n\n**2. GNN Prediction (Equations 6, 7, 8 & 9):**\n\n```javascript\n// Highly simplified conceptual illustration; no specific GNN library used\nfunction predictWorkflowPerformance(gnn, workflow, taskInstruction) {\n  const nodeFeatures = workflow.agents.map(agent => sentenceTransformer(agent.prompt));\n\n  const graphEmbedding = gnn(workflow.adjMatrix, nodeFeatures); // Simplified GNN call\n\n  const taskEmbedding = mlpProjector(sentenceTransformer(taskInstruction));\n\n  const combinedEmbedding = [...graphEmbedding, ...taskEmbedding]; // Concatenation\n\n  const predictedPerformance = mlp(combinedEmbedding); // Prediction\n  return predictedPerformance;\n}\n\n\n// Placeholder functions (replace with actual library implementations)\nconst sentenceTransformer = (text) => [/* Numerical embeddings of the text */];\nconst mlpProjector = (embedding) => [/* Projected embedding */];\nconst mlp = (embedding) => /* Predicted Performance (e.g. probability of success) */;\n\n// Very simplified GNN (for illustration; replace with actual GNN architecture)\nconst gnn = (adjMatrix, nodeFeatures) => {\n  // Message passing and aggregation highly simplified for illustration\n  let updatedNodeFeatures = nodeFeatures;\n  for (let l = 0; l < numLayers; l++) {\n    const nextNodeFeatures = [];\n    for (let i = 0; i < nodeFeatures.length; i++) {\n      const neighbors = adjMatrix[i].filter(val => val === 1); // Find neighbors based on adjacency matrix\n      const aggregatedFeatures = neighbors.reduce((acc, j) => addVectors(acc, updatedNodeFeatures[j]), [0,0,0]); // Simple aggregation\n      nextNodeFeatures.push(updateFeatures(updatedNodeFeatures[i], aggregatedFeatures)); // Simplified update function\n    }\n    updatedNodeFeatures = nextNodeFeatures;\n  }\n\n  return pool(updatedNodeFeatures); // Simplified graph-level pooling\n};\n\nconst addVectors = (a,b) => a.map((val, i) => val+b[i]);\nconst updateFeatures = (features, aggregated) => features.map((val, i) => val * aggregated[i]);\nconst pool = (nodeFeatures) => nodeFeatures.reduce((acc, val) => addVectors(acc,val), [0,0,0]);\nconst numLayers = 2;\n\n// Mock workflow data (replace with actual workflow data)\nconst mockWorkflow = {\n  agents: [\n    { prompt: \"Agent 1 prompt\" },\n    { prompt: \"Agent 2 prompt\" },\n  ],\n  adjMatrix: [[0,1], [1,0]],\n};\nconst mockTask = \"Some task instruction\";\n\nconst prediction = predictWorkflowPerformance(gnn, mockWorkflow, mockTask);\nconsole.log(prediction);\n```\n\n* **Purpose:** This code illustrates the core logic of using a GNN to predict the performance of an agentic workflow.  It uses placeholder functions for components like the sentence transformer, MLP projector, GNN, and final MLP. In practice, you would use a suitable graph neural network library (e.g., TensorFlow.js, PyTorch Geometric for JavaScript) to implement the GNN model and its associated operations. The provided GNN implementation is highly simplified for illustrative purposes and wouldn't be effective in a real-world scenario. The core idea is to encode the workflow's graph structure and the task into numerical embeddings, combine them, and then use an MLP to predict performance.\n\n\nThese JavaScript implementations help clarify the concepts discussed in the paper and provide a starting point for developers interested in experimenting with GNNs for predicting agentic workflow performance. Remember that these are simplified examples.  A real-world implementation would involve more complex GNN architectures, data preprocessing, and integration with LLM APIs.",
