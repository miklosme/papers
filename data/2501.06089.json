  "title": "Towards Developing Socially Compliant Automated Vehicles: State of the Art, Experts Expectations, and A Conceptual Framework",
  "abstract": "Automated Vehicles (AVs) hold promise for revolutionizing transportation by improving road safety, traffic efficiency, and overall mobility. Despite the steady advancement in high-level AVs in recent years, the transition to full automation entails a period of mixed traffic, where AVs of varying automation levels coexist with human-driven vehicles (HDVs). Making AVs socially compliant and understood by human drivers is expected to improve the safety and efficiency of mixed traffic. Thus, ensuring AVs compatibility with HDVs and social acceptance is crucial for their successful and seamless integration into mixed traffic. However, research in this critical area of developing Socially Compliant AVs (SCAVs) remains sparse. This study carries out the first comprehensive scoping review to assess the current state of the art in developing SCAVs, identifying key concepts, methodological approaches, and research gaps. An expert interview was also conducted to identify critical research gaps and expectations towards SCAVs. Based on the scoping review and expert interview input, a conceptual framework is proposed for the development of SCAVs. The conceptual framework is evaluated using an online survey targeting researchers, technicians, policymakers, and other relevant professionals worldwide. The survey results provide valuable validation and insights, affirming the significance of the proposed conceptual framework in tackling the challenges of integrating AVs into mixed-traffic environments. Additionally, future research perspectives and suggestions are discussed, contributing to the research and development agenda of SCAVs.",
  "summary": "This paper explores creating \"socially compliant\" autonomous vehicles (SCAVs) that can interact smoothly and safely with human drivers.  It proposes a conceptual framework encompassing perception, decision-making (incorporating social cues and driving styles), planning, control, and a bidirectional behavioral adaptation module to enable mutual learning between human drivers and AVs.\n\nKey points for LLM-based multi-agent systems:\n\n* **Implicit Communication Interpretation:**  SCAVs need to understand subtle human cues (e.g., waving, deceleration) like LLMs interpreting natural language nuances.\n* **Behavioral Adaptation:** The proposed bidirectional adaptation module mirrors the need for agents in LLM-based systems to dynamically adapt to each other and human users.\n* **Multi-Objective Optimization:**  Balancing safety, efficiency, and comfort resonates with optimizing various factors in LLM-agent interactions, like response quality, speed, and user satisfaction.\n* **Multi-Agent Modeling:**  The paper's emphasis on interactions between AVs and human drivers mirrors the complexity of LLM-based multi-agent systems, where agents may need to cooperate or compete.\n* **Sensing and Perception:**  The focus on robust perception for AVs translates to the need for LLMs to accurately process complex information and extract relevant features for decision-making.\n* **Social and Cultural Alignment:**  The paper highlights the challenge of adapting to cultural driving norms, which parallels the need for LLMs and agents to be sensitive to diverse cultural contexts in communication.\n* **eHMI Communication:**  The use of external human-machine interfaces (eHMI) in SCAVs suggests the potential for designing explicit communication channels between agents and humans in LLM-based systems, going beyond natural language.",
  "takeaways": "This research paper provides several key insights applicable to JavaScript developers working on LLM-based multi-agent applications for the web. Here are some practical examples leveraging JavaScript frameworks and libraries:\n\n**1. Socially Compliant Decision Making:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Building a multi-agent chatbot system for customer service where each bot handles a specific aspect of a customer's request (order status, technical support, returns, etc.).\n* **Implementation:** Use LangChain.js to connect LLMs (like OpenAI's GPT models) to act as individual agents.  Implement the \"Socially Compliant Decision Making\" module using a rule-based system or a smaller LLM.  This module receives the agents' proposed actions and evaluates them against social context (defined through prompt engineering, user profiles, or conversational history). For example, if the order status bot sees the return bot is already interacting with the customer regarding a late delivery, it won't send another notification about the delay.  This mimics the \"implicit communication\" discussed in the paper.\n* **Framework/Library:** LangChain.js, Node.js\n\n**2. Bidirectional Behavioral Adaptation:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Developing a collaborative web-based writing tool where multiple users (and potentially AI agents) can simultaneously edit a document.\n* **Implementation:** Each user (and AI) is an agent. Track user edits in real-time. Train a small LLM on a dataset of collaborative writing behaviors to predict user responses to different editing styles. If an AI agent detects a user frequently reverting its edits, it can adjust its behavior (e.g., propose less drastic changes, provide explanations for edits via a chat interface, or request clarification from the user).  This \"bidirectional adaptation\" improves collaboration.\n* **Framework/Library:** Socket.IO, TensorFlow.js (for training the adaptation model)\n\n**3. Spatial-Temporal Memory:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Creating an interactive game where AI agents navigate a virtual world and interact with players and other agents.\n* **Implementation:** Store past agent interactions (location, actions, player responses) in a database (e.g., MongoDB). Use this data to train a recurrent neural network (RNN) or transformer model (using TensorFlow.js or Brain.js) to inform future agent actions. For example, if players frequently avoid a certain area, AI agents can learn to avoid it as well or investigate the cause.  This utilizes the \"Spatial-Temporal Memory\" concept to learn and adapt over time.\n* **Framework/Library:** Node.js, MongoDB, TensorFlow.js/Brain.js\n\n**4. eHMI Communication:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Building a virtual meeting assistant that helps facilitate discussions and track action items.\n* **Implementation:** When an AI agent suggests an action item, it doesn't just add it to a list. It also displays a visual cue on the screen and generates a short, natural language explanation using the LLM. If another agent has a conflicting suggestion, it can highlight the conflict visually and propose a resolution via a chat interface, mirroring the paper's emphasis on explicit communication.\n* **Framework/Library:** React.js, LangChain.js\n\n\n**5. Experimentation Sandbox:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Creating a simple JavaScript-based multi-agent simulation environment (e.g., using a canvas element) to experiment with various social compliance strategies.\n* **Implementation:** Create agents as JavaScript objects with simple behaviors. Implement different social compliance rules (e.g., collision avoidance, following social norms represented by constraints in the virtual environment, adapting to other agents' behavior). Visualize the agents' interactions on the canvas. This allows developers to quickly test and visualize the impact of different strategies without complex LLM integration initially.\n* **Framework/Library:** Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas, Chart.js (for data visualization).\n\n\nThese examples demonstrate how the theoretical concepts in the paper can be translated into practical web applications. By using readily available JavaScript libraries and frameworks, developers can start exploring and experimenting with socially compliant LLM-based multi-agent systems, leading to more engaging and collaborative user experiences. Remember to focus on responsible development, data privacy, and minimizing biases during the training process.",
