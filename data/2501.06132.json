  "title": "CoDriveVLM: VLM-Enhanced Urban Cooperative Dispatching and Motion Planning for Future Autonomous Mobility on Demand Systems",
  "abstract": "Abstract-The increasing demand for flexible and efficient urban transportation solutions has spotlighted the limitations of traditional Demand Responsive Transport (DRT) systems, particularly in accommodating diverse passenger needs and dynamic urban environments. Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (AMoD) systems have emerged as a promising alternative, leveraging connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to provide responsive and adaptable services. However, existing methods primarily focus on either vehicle scheduling or path planning, which often simplify complex urban layouts and neglect the necessity for simultaneous coordination and mutual avoidance among CAVs. This oversimplification poses significant challenges to the deployment of AMoD systems in real-world scenarios. To address these gaps, we propose CoDriveVLM, a novel framework that integrates high-fidelity simultaneous dispatching and cooperative motion planning for future AMoD systems. Our method harnesses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enhance multi-modality information processing, and this enables comprehensive dispatching and collision risk evaluation. The VLM-enhanced CAV dispatching coordinator is introduced to effectively manage complex and unforeseen AMoD conditions, thus supporting efficient scheduling decision-making. Furthermore, we propose a scalable decentralized cooperative motion planning method via consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) focusing on collision risk evaluation and decentralized trajectory optimization. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of CoDriveVLM in various traffic conditions, showcasing its potential to significantly improve the fidelity and effectiveness of AMoD systems in future urban transportation networks. The code is available at https://github.com/henryhcliu/CoDriveVLM.git.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces CoDriveVLM, a framework for managing fleets of autonomous vehicles (CAVs) in a Mobility-on-Demand (AMoD) system.  It addresses the challenges of dynamic passenger requests, route planning, and collision avoidance in complex urban environments.\n\nCoDriveVLM uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enhance decision-making. VLMs process information from BEV images (bird's-eye view maps) annotated with vehicle and passenger locations and textual descriptions of the scenario. This multi-modal input enables the VLM to assign CAVs to passengers (dispatching) and assess collision risks. A hybrid system combining VLM dispatching with an optimization-based approach using ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers) allows for efficient, decentralized control of the CAVs, enabling them to navigate complex scenarios while avoiding collisions and minimizing travel times.  A memory module storing past VLM interactions allows for few-shot learning and improved performance over time.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents valuable insights for JavaScript developers working with LLM-based multi-agent applications, especially in web development contexts like simulating complex environments or coordinating multiple AI agents within a browser-based application. Here are some practical examples leveraging the core concepts from CoDriveVLM:\n\n**1. VLM-Enhanced Dispatching in a Browser-Based Strategy Game:**\n\nImagine a browser-based strategy game where multiple AI-controlled units need to be coordinated. You could use a VLM (accessed through a JavaScript API like LangChain) for dynamic task assignment.  \n\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** Use a library like TensorFlow.js or a dedicated LLM integration library to process the game state (represented as a canvas image or a data structure) and generate natural language descriptions. This becomes the VLM's input along with a prompt defining the dispatching task.  The VLM output (unit-task assignments) is then parsed in JavaScript and used to update the game state.\n\n* **Example:**  The VLM receives a BEV-like representation of the game map and a prompt: \"Assign units 1, 2, and 3 to attack enemy bases A, B, or C, considering unit type and base vulnerability.  Prioritize minimizing travel distance.\"  The VLM might output:  `[[Unit 1, Base B], [Unit 2, Base A], [Unit 3, Base C]]`, which your JavaScript code then uses to direct the units.\n\n**2. Collaborative Motion Planning for UI Elements:**\n\nConsider a complex web application with many dynamic UI elements that need to move around smoothly without overlapping. The concept of decentralized cooperative motion planning using ADMM, as described in the paper, can be applied here.\n\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** Represent each UI element as an agent with a desired position.  Implement a simplified version of ADMM in JavaScript using a numerical optimization library like numeric.js.  Each agent iteratively updates its position based on its own objective (reaching its target) and constraints to avoid overlapping with neighbors. The distributed nature of ADMM minimizes communication overhead, making it suitable for the browser environment.\n\n* **Example:**  Imagine animating several floating information boxes on a webpage. Instead of pre-calculated animations, you could use this approach to have them dynamically reposition themselves as the user interacts with the page, avoiding collisions and maintaining a visually appealing layout.\n\n**3. Simulating Multi-Agent Systems with Three.js and a VLM:**\n\nIf you're developing a web-based simulation of a multi-agent system (e.g., traffic simulation, swarm robotics), you can use Three.js for 3D rendering and a VLM for higher-level reasoning and coordination.\n\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**  Three.js handles the visualization of the agents and their environment. A VLM, similar to the dispatching example, receives a simplified representation of the simulation state (agent positions, environment features) and provides high-level instructions, like assigning goals or defining group behavior. Your JavaScript code parses these instructions and updates the simulation state accordingly.\n\n* **Example:**  In a traffic simulation, the VLM could receive a BEV representation of a traffic intersection (created from the Three.js scene) and provide instructions on how to manage traffic flow based on congestion levels.  \"Route vehicles from north to east, prioritizing emergency vehicles. Minimize waiting time.\"\n\n**4. Few-Shot Learning for Adaptable Agent Behavior:**\n\nImplement the memory module and retrieval concepts using local storage or a small server-side database. Store past interactions (user actions, agent responses, environment states) along with the LLM's output.\n\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** When the LLM encounters a new situation, retrieve relevant past interactions using similarity measures (cosine similarity on embeddings) to provide context. This allows for more adaptable and personalized behavior based on prior experience.\n\n* **Example:**  In a chatbot application, using past conversations as context can help the LLM provide more relevant and personalized responses.  \"User expressed frustration in previous interaction about X.  Provide more empathetic and detailed explanation this time.\"\n\n\nThese examples demonstrate how a JavaScript developer can apply the core ideas of multi-agent coordination, VLM integration, and optimized planning to create more intelligent and dynamic web applications. Remember to adapt the complexity of ADMM and the VLM's role based on your specific application's needs and the computational resources available in a browser environment. Libraries like LangChain, TensorFlow.js, numeric.js, and Three.js provide the building blocks for putting these concepts into practice.",

It integrates dispatching, routing, and cooperative motion planning using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM).\n\n**Key Steps:**\n\n1. **Dispatching (Line 2):**  The `vlmDispatchingAgent` function uses the VLM to assign target destinations for each Connected Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) based on passenger requests and current traffic conditions.\n2. **Routing (Lines 3-4):** A* search finds initial routes, and a Savitzky-Golay filter smooths them for better trajectory tracking.\n3. **Adaptive Frequency Dispatching (Lines 8-10):** An adaptive system calls the VLM dispatching agent when there are pending passenger requests and available CAVs. This optimization reduces unnecessary calls to the VLM.\n4. **Graph Evolution (Line 6):** The `vlmGuidedGraphEvolution` groups CAVs into subgraphs based on the VLM's assessment of potential collision risks. This enables localized and efficient cooperative planning. \n5. **Cooperative Motion Planning (Lines 8-38):** Within each subgraph, ADMM is used to optimize the trajectories of the CAVs collaboratively.  This involves finding nearest waypoints from the initial path, initializing ADMM variables, iteratively solving the local LQR problems, and updating the state and control of each vehicle until a safe and efficient trajectory is found. This process includes dual updates for consistency constraints and primal updates for individual vehicle optimization.\n6. **Motion Execution and Feedback (Lines 40-42):** The system executes the planned trajectories for a short horizon (`Tp`), receives feedback about the updated system state, and relays the CAV states for further processing.\n\n**Purpose:**\n\nThe algorithm's goal is to manage a fleet of CAVs effectively in a dynamic urban environment to serve passenger requests efficiently and safely. The use of VLMs allows the system to handle complex situations and adapt to changing conditions, while ADMM enables efficient and scalable cooperative planning for multiple CAVs.\n\n**No other pseudocode blocks found.**",
