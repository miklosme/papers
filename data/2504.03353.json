  "title": "Decentralized Collective World Model for Emergent Communication and Coordination",
  "abstract": "Abstract—We propose a fully decentralized multi-agent world model that enables both symbol emergence for communication and coordinated behavior through temporal extension of collective predictive coding. Unlike previous research that focuses on either communication or coordination separately, our approach achieves both simultaneously. Our method integrates world models with communication channels, enabling agents to predict environmental dynamics, estimate states from partial observations, and share critical information through bidirectional message exchange with contrastive learning for message alignment. Using a two-agent trajectory drawing task, we demonstrate that our communication-based approach outperforms non-communicative models when agents have divergent perceptual capabilities, achieving the second-best coordination after centralized models. Importantly, our distributed approach with constraints preventing direct access to other agents’ internal states facilitates the emergence of more meaningful symbol systems that accurately reflect environmental states. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of decentralized communication for supporting coordination while developing shared representations of the environment.",
  "summary": "This paper proposes a decentralized approach for multi-agent systems to develop a shared language and coordinate actions in dynamic, partially observable environments.  It uses world models integrated with communication channels, enabling agents to predict, share information, and learn coordinated behaviors via message exchange.  The system employs contrastive learning to align messages between agents, fostering a common symbolic language without centralized control.\n\n\nKey points for LLM-based multi-agent systems:\n\n* **Decentralized Communication:** Agents develop a shared symbolic language through bidirectional message exchange, crucial for LLMs to interact and coordinate.\n* **World Models:** Agents use world models to predict and understand their environment, analogous to how LLMs use internal representations to understand text.\n* **Contrastive Learning:** Aligns messages for consistent interpretation across agents, essential for LLMs to understand each other's generated text.\n* **Partial Observability:** Addresses scenarios where agents have limited information, mirroring real-world LLM applications where complete knowledge is unavailable.\n* **Emergent Communication:** The system organically develops a shared language, opening possibilities for LLMs to develop novel communication protocols.\n* **Coordination in Dynamic Environments:** Focuses on coordination in changing situations, directly applicable to dynamic LLM-based interactions.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents exciting possibilities for JavaScript developers working with LLMs in multi-agent web applications. Here are some practical examples illustrating how its insights can be applied:\n\n**1. Collaborative Content Creation:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine building a collaborative writing platform where multiple users, aided by LLMs, contribute to a single document.  Each user might focus on a different section or aspect, with partial knowledge of the overall document.\n* **Application:**  Using the decentralized collective world model approach, each LLM agent (representing a user) can maintain its own internal representation of its section. They can then communicate with other agents through message exchange (implemented via a server-side message queue like Redis or a peer-to-peer library like PeerJS). This communication, facilitated by the shared symbolic system (emergent vocabulary learned via InfoNCE), allows agents to align their contributions and maintain consistency without direct access to each other’s internal states. The shared vocabulary can be represented using embeddings generated by the LLMs, aligned through contrastive learning techniques.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** Server-side Node.js can handle communication and coordination between agents, utilizing libraries like Langchain.js for LLM integration and TensorFlow.js for implementing the contrastive loss function. Client-side JavaScript frameworks like React or Vue.js can manage user interfaces and interactions.\n\n**2. Decentralized Chatbots for Customer Service:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  A network of specialized chatbots handles different aspects of customer service (e.g., technical support, billing, order tracking).  Each chatbot has limited knowledge, but collectively they cover the full range of customer needs.\n* **Application:** The paper’s decentralized approach allows these chatbots (represented as agents) to coordinate without a central controller.  When a chatbot encounters a query outside its domain, it can communicate with other chatbots using the learned symbolic system (again, emergent vocabulary and embeddings) to find the appropriate specialist. This reduces response time and improves customer experience.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**  Each chatbot could be a separate Node.js service.  Inter-chatbot communication can be implemented using a message bus like Kafka or RabbitMQ.  Client-side JavaScript would manage the user interface, routing messages to the appropriate chatbot.\n\n**3. Collaborative Game Development with LLMs:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  Multiple users collaborate to create a game world, each focusing on a specific aspect (e.g., narrative, level design, character development). LLMs assist each user, generating content based on their input and collaborating to ensure a cohesive game experience.\n* **Application:**  Each user-LLM pair acts as an agent, maintaining its own world model (representing their aspect of the game). These agents can communicate to share information and ensure consistency, using the emergent symbolic system to represent game elements, character attributes, and story elements.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** Similar to collaborative writing, server-side Node.js manages agent interaction and data synchronization. Client-side JavaScript frameworks (e.g., Phaser, Babylon.js) handle game rendering and user input.\n\n**Key JavaScript Considerations:**\n\n* **Embeddings and Vector Databases:** Use libraries like TensorFlow.js or libraries for vector databases like Pinecone or Weaviate to manage and compare the emergent vocabulary represented as embeddings.\n* **Communication Libraries:** Utilize Socket.io, PeerJS, or server-side message queues (Redis, Kafka, RabbitMQ) for agent communication.\n* **LLM Integration:** Leverage libraries like Langchain.js or Hugging Face's JavaScript library to integrate and manage LLMs.\n* **Frontend Frameworks:** Use React, Vue.js, or similar frameworks for building user interfaces and handling user interactions.\n\nBy understanding and applying the concepts of decentralized communication and emergent symbolic systems presented in the paper, JavaScript developers can build more robust, scalable, and intelligent multi-agent web applications powered by LLMs. Remember that experimenting with different configurations, loss functions, and architectures is crucial for achieving optimal results in your specific project.",
  "pseudocode": "The paper includes pseudocode for Algorithm 1, which describes the action determination process. Here's the JavaScript equivalent:\n\n```javascript\nfunction actionDetermination(observationsA, observationsB, actionsA, actionsB, messagesA, messagesB) {\n  // 1. Inference of Internal Representations and Messages\n  const inferredStatesA = [];\n  const inferredMessagesA = [];\n  for (let t = 0; t < observationsA.length; t++) {\n    // Assuming q* is a function that infers state and message\n    // based on current and past observations and actions (using world model)\n    const { state, message } = qStar(observationsA, actionsA, inferredStatesA, inferredMessagesA, t); \n    inferredStatesA.push(state);\n    inferredMessagesA.push(message);\n  }\n\n  // Similar inference for agent B (omitted for brevity, replace A with B)\n  // ...\n\n  // 2. Message Exchange\n  const exchangedMessagesA = inferredMessagesA; // Shallow copy - effectively exchanges references\n  const exchangedMessagesB = inferredMessagesB; // Similar exchange for B\n\n  // 3. Selection of Messages and Internal Representations\n  let selectedMessagesA = null;\n  let minVFEA = Infinity;\n  for (const messages of [inferredMessagesA, exchangedMessagesB]) { // Check self-generated vs received\n      const reconstructedObservations = reconstructObservations(observationsA, messages); // Uses world model to reconstruct\n      const vfeA = calculateVFE(reconstructedObservations, observationsA, actionsA, messages);\n      if (vfeA < minVFEA) {\n        minVFEA = vfeA;\n        selectedMessagesA = messages;\n      }\n  }\n\n  // Similar selection for agent B (omitted for brevity)\n // ...\n\n\n  // 4. Action Determination\n  const actionA = policyA(inferredStatesA[inferredStatesA.length - 1], selectedMessagesA[selectedMessagesA.length-1]); \n  actionsA.push(actionA); // Add to action history\n\n  // Similar action determination for B (omitted for brevity)\n  // ...\n\n  return {actionA, actionB};\n}\n\n\n// Helper functions (placeholders, actual implementations would be more complex)\nfunction qStar(observations, actions, states, messages, t) {\n  // ... (World model inference logic to estimate state and message)\n  return { state: {}, message: {} }; \n}\n\nfunction reconstructObservations(observations, messages) {\n    // ... (World model reconstruction logic)\n    return [];\n}\n\nfunction calculateVFE(reconstructedObservations, observations, actions, messages) {\n  // ... (VFE calculation)\n  return 0;\n}\n\nfunction policyA(state, message) {\n    // ... (Policy logic to choose an action)\n    return {};\n}\n\n// Similar policyB and helper functions for B would be defined.\n\n```\n\n**Explanation and Purpose:**\n\nThis algorithm governs how agents choose actions in a partially observable, decentralized environment.  It's based on the Collective Predictive Coding (CPC) framework and uses world models for state and message inference.\n\n1. **Inference:** Each agent uses its own world model (`qStar` function, representing  `q*(s|...)` in the paper) to infer its hidden state and a message based on its past and current observations and actions.  This step captures the agent's understanding of the environment and its attempt to communicate relevant information.\n\n2. **Message Exchange:** Agents exchange their inferred message sequences. This allows them to access information beyond their own limited perspective.\n\n3. **Selection:** Agents choose between their self-inferred messages and the messages received from the other agent. The selection is based on which message sequence leads to a lower Variational Free Energy (VFE) when used to reconstruct observations. This effectively chooses the message that best explains the agent's sensory inputs.\n\n4. **Action Determination:** Finally, each agent chooses an action based on its last inferred state and the selected message. The chosen action is then added to the agent's history.\n\nThe core idea is to enable agents to coordinate by building a shared understanding of the environment through emergent communication, even when their individual perceptions are limited.  The use of world models and VFE minimization provides a principled way to achieve this coordination in a decentralized setting.",
