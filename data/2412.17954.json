  "title": "Asynchronous Training of Mixed-Role Human Actors in a Partially-Observable Environment",
  "abstract": "In cooperative training, humans within a team coordinate on complex tasks, building mental models of their teammates and learning to adapt to teammates' actions in real-time. To reduce the often prohibitive scheduling constraints associated with cooperative training, this article introduces a paradigm for cooperative asynchronous training of human teams in which trainees practice coordination with autonomous teammates rather than humans. We introduce a novel experimental design for evaluating autonomous teammates for use as training partners in cooperative training. We apply the design to a human-subjects experiment where humans are trained with either another human or an autonomous teammate and are evaluated with a new human subject in a new, partially observable, cooperative game developed for this study. Importantly, we employ a method to cluster teammate trajectories from demonstrations performed in the experiment to form a smaller number of training conditions. This results in a simpler experiment design that enabled us to conduct a complex cooperative training human-subjects study in a reasonable amount of time. Through a demonstration of the proposed experimental design, we provide takeaways and design recommendations for future research in the development of cooperative asynchronous training systems utilizing robot surrogates for human teammates.",
  "summary": "This paper explores asynchronous training for multi-agent teams, where trainees practice with AI teammates instead of humans to alleviate scheduling constraints.  It introduces Overcooked-AI: Have You Been Served? (HYBS), a partially observable game with distinct roles, as a testbed. Key points for LLM-based multi-agent systems include: using unsupervised clustering of behavior trajectories to categorize training partners, combining imitation learning and heuristic approaches for AI teammate design, and focusing evaluation on generalization to unseen teammate strategies.  While initial results show no significant improvement in evaluation performance due to the asynchronous training, the paper offers valuable design recommendations for future research, such as better integration between training and evaluation setups and developing more human-like AI teammate behaviors to enhance training experience and outcomes.",
  "takeaways": "This research paper, while focusing on a specific game (HYBS, a variant of Overcooked-AI), offers valuable insights for JavaScript developers working with LLM-based multi-agent systems in web applications. Here are practical examples applying the paper's key takeaways:\n\n**1. Behavior Clustering for Personalized Agent Interactions:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine building a multi-agent customer support chatbot system.  Different customers have different support needs and communication styles.\n* **Application:** Use a clustering algorithm (e.g., k-means implemented in TensorFlow.js or a dedicated library like ML5.js) on past conversation logs. Cluster customers based on factors like conversation length, sentiment, and specific keywords used.  This allows you to develop specialized LLM prompts and responses tailored to each cluster.  For example, a cluster of concise, technical users could receive direct, information-rich responses, while a cluster of users expressing frustration might receive more empathetic and reassuring responses.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** Use a Node.js backend to preprocess and cluster the conversation data.  Then, in your frontend JavaScript (using React, Vue, or Angular), use the identified cluster to select the appropriate LLM prompt and handle the chatbot's responses.\n\n**2. Asynchronous Training and Evaluation for Chatbots:**\n\n* **Scenario:** You're developing a multi-agent chatbot system for a collaborative writing platform. Each chatbot specializes in different writing aspects (grammar, style, tone, etc.).\n* **Application:** Train each chatbot LLM asynchronously using relevant datasets (e.g., grammar datasets for the grammar bot, style guides for the style bot). Evaluate the chatbot's individual performance using metrics relevant to their specialization. Then, evaluate the system's overall performance in asynchronous simulated collaborative writing scenarios. You can simulate these by feeding each bot a part of a document and then combining their outputs.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** Use LangChain.js or a similar framework to manage the training and evaluation pipeline.  For simulated collaboration, you can use a Node.js server to orchestrate the interaction between different bots and combine their outputs.\n\n**3. User Feedback and Subjective Metrics for LLM Agent Evaluation:**\n\n* **Scenario:** You have a multi-agent system for personalized recommendations in an e-commerce web app. Each agent focuses on a different product category.\n* **Application:** Collect user feedback on the perceived helpfulness, relevance, and trustworthiness of each agent's recommendations. Use this subjective data alongside objective metrics like click-through rates and conversion rates to gain a more holistic understanding of agent performance.  This helps identify areas where LLM performance might be high, but user perception is low, and vice-versa.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** Integrate feedback forms within your frontend JavaScript framework.  Store the feedback data in a database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) accessible via your Node.js backend. Analyze this data alongside objective metrics to refine LLM prompts and improve user experience.\n\n**4. Address Full vs. Partial Observability During Training:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Developing a multi-agent system for real-time strategy game AI. Each agent controls a different unit type. During training, agents have full information. During gameplay, they only see their immediate surroundings.\n* **Application:**  Train LLMs with both full and partial information scenarios.  Introduce \"fog of war\" mechanics during training to simulate partial observability.  This better prepares agents for the constraints of actual gameplay and helps them develop strategies that don't rely on perfect information.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** Use a JavaScript game engine like Phaser or Babylon.js to create training environments with and without the \"fog of war.\"  Manage and orchestrate the different training environments with a Node.js backend.\n\n\n**Key Libraries and Frameworks:**\n\n* **TensorFlow.js/ML5.js:** For implementing clustering algorithms in the browser.\n* **LangChain.js:** For managing LLM training and interaction workflows.\n* **React/Vue/Angular:** For building interactive frontends.\n* **Node.js:** For backend logic, data processing, and orchestration of multi-agent systems.\n* **Phaser/Babylon.js:** For developing game-like environments for training and evaluation.\n\nBy incorporating these insights and leveraging relevant JavaScript tools, developers can build more robust, personalized, and user-centric multi-agent web applications.  The focus on asynchronous training, subjective metrics, and addressing observability mismatches is particularly valuable for creating LLM-powered agents that truly collaborate and adapt in dynamic web environments.",
