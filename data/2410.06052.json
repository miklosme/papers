  "title": "Concurrent-Learning Based Relative Localization in Shape Formation of Robot Swarms",
  "abstract": "Abstract-In this paper, we address the shape formation problem for massive robot swarms in environments where external localization systems are unavailable. Achieving this task effectively with solely onboard measurements is still scarcely explored and faces some practical challenges. To solve this challenging problem, we propose the following novel results. Firstly, to estimate the relative positions among neighboring robots, a concurrent-learning based estimator is proposed. It relaxes the persistent excitation condition required in the classical ones such as least-square estimator. Secondly, we introduce a finite-time agreement protocol to determine the shape location. This is achieved by estimating the relative position between each robot and a randomly assigned seed robot. The initial position of the seed one marks the shape location. Thirdly, based on the theoretical results of the relative localization, a novel behavior-based control strategy is devised. This strategy not only enables adaptive shape formation of large group of robots but also enhances the observability of inter-robot relative localization. Numerical simulation results are provided to verify the performance of our proposed strategy compared to the state-of-the-art ones. Additionally, outdoor experiments on real robots further demonstrate the practical effectiveness and robustness of our methods.",
  "summary": "- This paper proposes a novel method for large-scale robot swarm formation control relying solely on local sensing and communication, eliminating the need for external localization systems like GPS.\n- A key element relevant to LLM-based multi-agent systems is the use of a \"concurrent-learning based estimator\", which incorporates both current and historical data to estimate relative positions between agents. This approach allows for smoother movement and removes the need for artificial persistent excitation signals, which are commonly used in traditional estimators but negatively impact performance in large-scale systems.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents a novel approach for shape formation in robot swarms using only local measurements, which has exciting implications for LLM-based multi-agent AI development, particularly in web development. Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights:\n\n**1. Decentralized Coordination in Web Applications**\n\n* Imagine building a collaborative web application like Figma or Google Docs, but with much larger scale and complexity. This paper's relative localization algorithm (Section IV) can be adapted to coordinate numerous AI agents (represented as nodes in a network) interacting within a web application, even with limited information about each other's states. This allows for:\n    * **Scalability:**  Handle massive numbers of users and AI agents working concurrently.\n    * **Offline Collaboration:** Potentially enable collaboration in scenarios with intermittent or no internet connection.\n\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * Utilize libraries like `Vis.js` or `Cytoscape.js` for visualizing and managing the network of AI agents within the web app.\n    * Implement the relative localization algorithm using JavaScript's mathematical capabilities. Each agent can update its understanding of its relative position within the network based on communication with nearby agents.\n\n**2.  LLM-powered Chatbots in Virtual Environments**\n\n*  Consider creating a virtual world (e.g., for gaming or simulations) populated by many LLM-powered chatbots.  The shape formation strategies (Section V) can be used to:\n    * **Dynamically Position Chatbots:**  Guide chatbots to form specific patterns or arrangements within the virtual environment, creating more realistic crowd behaviors or strategic formations. \n    * **Emergent Behavior:** Potentially lead to complex, emergent behavior among the chatbots as they interact within the defined shape, leading to richer user experiences.\n\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * Frameworks like `Three.js` or `Babylon.js` can be used to build the 3D virtual environment within a web browser.\n    * Each chatbot can be an independent AI agent running an LLM and using the shape formation control laws to determine its movement and interactions within the virtual world.\n\n**3.  Content Generation and Layout in Web Design**\n\n* Imagine a web design tool where AI assists in content placement and layout. This paper's techniques can be applied to:\n    * **AI-Driven Design:**  LLMs generate content blocks, and the relative localization and shape formation algorithms are used to dynamically arrange these blocks on a webpage, optimizing for aesthetics and user experience.\n    * **Responsive Design:** As the screen size changes, the content blocks can fluidly rearrange themselves, maintaining an optimal layout based on the principles of the algorithm.\n\n*  **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * Leverage existing layout libraries like `React Grid Layout` or `Gridster.js`.\n    * Develop custom logic in JavaScript that uses the relative positioning information from the algorithm to update the positions of content blocks within the chosen layout framework.\n\n**Additional Considerations**\n\n* **Communication:** WebSockets can be used for real-time, bidirectional communication between the web app's backend (where the AI agents/LLMs are running) and the frontend (the user interface).\n* **Data Structures:** JavaScript objects and arrays can effectively represent the agents, their relative positions, and the desired shape formation.\n\nThis research provides a solid theoretical foundation for building robust, decentralized, and scalable multi-agent systems within web applications. With some creative adaptation and the power of JavaScript and LLMs, exciting possibilities await!",

It consists of two main algorithms:\n\n1. **`shapeLocalizationAgreement(lambda, delta, n)`:** This algorithm enables each robot to reach a consensus on the desired shape's position based on local measurements. It utilizes a finite-time consensus-based estimator and a hop-count mechanism to ensure convergence and agreement among robots.\n\n2. **`distributedShapeFormationControl(ĝi,0, lambda, RLi, RDi)`:** This algorithm implements the behavior-based control strategy for shape formation. It utilizes four velocity commands: shape-entering, shape-exploring, neighbor-interacting, and localization-enhancing, to guide robots to form the desired shape. The algorithm also includes a relative localization update step for localized neighboring robots.\n\n**Purpose:**\n\nThe overall goal of this code is to enable a swarm of robots to autonomously form a desired shape without relying on external localization infrastructures. Each robot uses only local distance and displacement measurements to estimate its relative position to neighbors, agree on the shape's position, and navigate to its designated location within the formation.\n\nThis implementation demonstrates the application of multi-agent AI concepts in JavaScript for distributed control and coordination of robot swarms, highlighting the potential of these techniques in advancing robotics and web technologies.",
