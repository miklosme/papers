  "title": "Nash equilibrium seeking for a class of quadratic-bilinear Wasserstein distributionally robust games",
  "abstract": "Abstract We consider a class of Wasserstein distributionally robust Nash equilibrium problems, where agents construct heterogeneous data-driven Wasserstein ambiguity sets using private samples and radii, in line with their individual risk-averse behaviour. By leveraging relevant properties of this class of games, we show that equilibria of the original seemingly infinite-dimensional problem can be obtained as a solution to a finite-dimensional Nash equilibrium problem. We then reformulate the problem as a finite-dimensional variational inequality and establish the connection between the corresponding solution sets. Our reformulation has scalable behaviour with respect to the data size and maintains a fixed number of constraints, independently of the number of samples. To compute a solution, we leverage two algorithms, based on the golden ratio algorithm. The efficiency of both algorithmic schemes is corroborated through extensive simulation studies on an illustrative example and a stochastic portfolio allocation game, where behavioural coupling among investors is modeled.",
  "summary": "This paper addresses decision-making in multi-agent systems under uncertainty, where each agent has private data and differing levels of risk aversion. It focuses on a specific class of games with quadratic-bilinear cost functions affected by uncertainty and uses Wasserstein ambiguity sets to model the uncertainty in each agent's private data.  The core contribution is a reformulation of this complex distributionally robust game into a more computationally tractable variational inequality problem, making it easier to find stable solutions (Nash equilibria) where no agent can improve their outcome by unilaterally changing their strategy.\n\nFor LLM-based multi-agent systems, this research offers a way to model agents with different \"personalities\" regarding risk and data interpretation. The reformulation provides a scalable approach for finding stable solutions in such systems, even with large datasets and complex interactions between agents. The paper's focus on individual, data-driven uncertainty sets is particularly relevant to personalized LLMs and their integration into multi-agent environments.  The data-driven nature of the approach aligns well with the data-centric paradigm of LLMs.  The focus on finding equilibrium solutions could impact LLM multi-agent system design, shifting from simply generating responses to strategically optimizing actions within a group of diverse agents.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents a valuable theoretical framework for handling uncertainty in multi-agent systems, which is directly applicable to LLM-based multi-agent web applications. Let's break down practical examples for JavaScript developers:\n\n**Scenario:** Building a collaborative writing web app where multiple LLMs contribute to a single document.  Uncertainty arises from the LLMs' inherent probabilistic nature and potential conflicting suggestions.\n\n**Applying the Research:**\n\n1. **Individual Ambiguity Sets (JavaScript Implementation):** Each LLM (agent) maintains its own ambiguity set.  In JavaScript, this could be represented as an array of possible text continuations or edits generated by the LLM, along with associated probabilities or confidence scores. Libraries like TensorFlow.js or ConvNetJS could be used to manage and manipulate these probability distributions.\n\n   ```javascript\n   // Example for LLM1's ambiguity set for the next sentence\n   const llm1AmbiguitySet = [\n     { text: \"The quick brown fox jumps.\", probability: 0.7 },\n     { text: \"The fox jumped quickly.\", probability: 0.2 },\n     { text: \"A brown fox jumped.\", probability: 0.1 }\n   ];\n   ```\n\n2. **Wasserstein Distance (JavaScript Implementation):**  The paper leverages the Wasserstein distance to measure the difference between probability distributions.  In our writing app, this could measure how different two LLMs' suggestions are.  While a full Wasserstein distance implementation might be complex, approximations using libraries like NumJs or simple distance metrics (e.g., cosine similarity between probability vectors) could provide a practical approach.\n\n   ```javascript\n   // Simplified distance calculation (example)\n   function simpleDistance(set1, set2) {\n     // Calculate a distance metric between the probability distributions\n     // ... (implementation using NumJs or other libraries)\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Robust Nash Equilibrium (JavaScript Application):** The goal is to find a stable solution (a robust Nash equilibrium) where no LLM can improve its contribution given the others.  This could be achieved by iteratively having each LLM generate suggestions, calculating distances between them, and adjusting the LLMs' parameters or prompting strategies based on the overall \"distance\" to a consensus.  This iterative process can be managed using asynchronous JavaScript and libraries like Socket.IO for real-time communication between the LLMs (if distributed).\n\n   ```javascript\n   // Iterative refinement of LLM contributions\n   async function findEquilibrium() {\n     while (!converged) {\n       const suggestions = await Promise.all(llms.map(llm => llm.generateText()));\n       const distances = calculateDistances(suggestions);\n       if (distancesBelowThreshold(distances)) {\n         converged = true;\n       } else {\n         adjustLlmParameters(llms, distances); //  Prompt engineering, temperature, etc.\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **Data-Driven Approach:**  The paper's emphasis on a data-driven approach is naturally aligned with how LLMs work. The ambiguity sets themselves are derived from the LLM outputs (data).  By analyzing the patterns in these ambiguity sets over time, we can refine the LLMs' behavior (e.g., through prompt engineering) to reduce uncertainty and improve convergence speed in future collaborations.\n\n**Other Web Development Examples:**\n\n* **Multi-agent Chatbots:**  Use the concepts to design a system of chatbots that can negotiate or collaborate to fulfill user requests, each with their own \"personality\" (ambiguity set) reflecting their expertise.\n* **Decentralized Content Moderation:**  Employ multiple LLMs to moderate user-generated content, with individual ambiguity sets capturing different moderation policies and converging towards a consensus decision.\n\n**Key Benefits for JavaScript Developers:**\n\n* **Managing Uncertainty:** The paper provides tools and concepts to handle inherent uncertainty in LLM-based systems.\n* **Improved Collaboration:** It facilitates the development of LLM-based systems that can effectively collaborate and achieve consensus.\n* **Scalability:**  The reformulation as a variational inequality problem offers scalability for larger numbers of agents (LLMs).\n\n\nBy combining these concepts with existing JavaScript frameworks and libraries, developers can create more robust and sophisticated multi-agent AI applications for the web. Remember that these are simplified examples. The complexity of a full implementation would depend on the specifics of the project. However, the core ideas from the paper provide a strong theoretical foundation for practical web development with multi-agent LLM systems.",

The key innovation of Hybrid-Alg over the standard aGRAAL algorithm lies in its adaptive momentum parameter (`theta`).  aGRAAL uses a fixed momentum, while Hybrid-Alg dynamically adjusts it based on the progress of the algorithm (through the `sum` and `sum_phi` calculations which track certain convergence properties, see [41] for details).  This adaptability is crucial for effectively handling potentially non-monotone VI mappings that arise in the game context. \n\n\nThe algorithm proceeds iteratively, adjusting the step size (`t`), updating the solution estimate (`x`), and refining the momentum parameter (`theta`). The proximal operator (`prox_g`) ensures that the updates remain within the feasible set. The core of the algorithm involves evaluating the VI mapping (`F(x)`), which embodies the structure of the game and the agents' cost functions (see Lemma 2.3 in the paper for details on the structure of `F(x)`). The specific update rules for `theta`, `sum`, and `sum_phi`  (which are not fully given here)  must be derived from equations 16 and 17 in reference [41] within the provided paper, based on the details of the game being modeled.\n\n\n**Purpose:**\n\nThe algorithm's purpose is to compute a DRNE, which represents a stable state in the game where no agent can improve their outcome by unilaterally changing their strategy, even considering the worst-case distribution within their ambiguity set. This is a robust solution concept that accounts for both strategic interactions and distributional uncertainty.  The paper shows how a distributionally robust game can be transformed into a VI problem, which is then tackled by this algorithm.",
