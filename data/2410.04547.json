  "title": "Distributed Detection of Adversarial Attacks for Resilient Cooperation of Multi-Robot Systems with Intermittent Communication",
  "abstract": "Abstract-This paper concerns the consensus and formation of a network of mobile autonomous agents in adversarial settings where a group of malicious (compromised) agents are subject to deception attacks. In addition, the communication network is arbitrarily time-varying and subject to intermittent connections, possibly imposed by denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. We provide explicit bounds for network connectivity in an integral sense, enabling the characterization of the system's resilience to specific classes of adversarial attacks. We also show that under the condition of connectivity in an integral sense uniformly in time, the system is finite-gain Lp stable and uniformly exponentially fast consensus and formation are achievable, provided malicious agents are detected and isolated from the network. We present a distributed and reconfigurable framework with theoretical guarantees for detecting malicious agents, allowing for the resilient cooperation of the remaining cooperative agents. Simulation studies are provided to illustrate the theoretical findings.",
  "summary": "This paper investigates how to make a group of robots work together reliably even when some robots are hacked (malicious) and communication is unreliable (intermittent). It focuses on detecting these hacked robots and enabling the good robots to still achieve their goal, like moving in formation, despite the disruptions. \n\nRelevant to LLM-based multi-agent systems, the paper emphasizes using local information available to each agent (like a robot or an LLM agent) for attack detection. It proposes a method for detecting malicious agents even when communication is intermittent, which is common in real-world scenarios. This localized approach could be relevant for developing more robust and secure LLM-based multi-agent systems.",
  "takeaways": "This paper provides valuable insights for JavaScript developers working with LLM-based multi-agent systems, especially in scenarios where communication reliability is a concern. Here are some practical examples:\n\n**1. Building Resilient Chatbots for Customer Service:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine building a system with multiple LLM-powered chatbots that collaborate to handle customer queries. Network disruptions or malicious bots posing as agents can disrupt the system.\n* **Application:**  This paper's concept of \"(μ,T)-PE connectivity\" can be implemented using a JavaScript library like Socket.IO to manage communication between chatbots. By tracking message delivery over time (the \"integral\" aspect), developers can identify persistently unreliable connections, potentially indicating DoS attacks or faulty bots.\n* **Implementation:** A heartbeat mechanism can be built in Socket.IO where chatbots periodically send \"alive\" signals. The system can then use a sliding window to track the \"integral\" of successful heartbeats over a time window (T). If this integral falls below a threshold (μ), the connection is flagged as potentially unreliable.\n\n**2. Collaborative LLM-powered Content Creation:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Multiple LLMs collaborate to generate content for a website, but some LLMs might be compromised, producing low-quality or malicious outputs.\n* **Application:** The \"r-robustness\" concept can be applied to the network of LLMs. Using Node.js and a graph library like Cytoscape.js, developers can model the network and analyze its robustness. This analysis can inform how to structure the network so that a limited number of malicious LLMs (less than \"r\") cannot significantly impact overall content quality.\n* **Implementation:** Define a quality metric for LLM outputs (e.g., plagiarism score, sentiment analysis). Track each LLM's performance over time. If an LLM consistently scores below a threshold, it can be temporarily removed from the network, similar to how malicious agents are isolated in the paper.\n\n**3. LLM-based Decentralized Marketplaces:**\n\n* **Scenario:** LLMs act as autonomous agents in a decentralized marketplace, negotiating trades. Malicious agents could attempt to manipulate prices or steal information.\n* **Application:**  Implement a \"local observer\" for each LLM agent using a JavaScript framework like TensorFlow.js. This observer, trained on past interactions, can detect deviations from expected behavior (e.g., unusually high bids, suspicious communication patterns). \n* **Implementation:** Each LLM agent's observer would analyze the messages received from other agents. Anomalies would trigger a local \"attack\" signal, prompting the agent to temporarily suspend interactions with the suspected malicious agent.\n\n**Libraries and Frameworks:**\n\n* **Socket.IO:** For real-time, bidirectional communication.\n* **Cytoscape.js:** For network visualization and analysis.\n* **TensorFlow.js:** For building and deploying machine learning models in the browser.\n* **LangChain.js:** For building applications with large language models.\n\n**General Considerations:**\n\n* **Performance:**  The computational complexity of the algorithms proposed in the paper should be carefully considered in web development, especially for real-time applications. \n* **Thresholds:** Setting appropriate thresholds for connectivity, robustness, and anomaly detection is crucial and will likely require experimentation and fine-tuning.\n\nThis paper encourages JavaScript developers to think critically about the vulnerabilities of LLM-based multi-agent systems in web development and provides practical tools and concepts for building more robust and secure applications.",
  "pseudocode": "```javascript\n// Algorithm 1: Resilient Consensus & Cooperation over Unreliable Networks\n\nfunction resilientCooperation(phi, sigma, epsilon) {\n  // Input: \n  //   phi(t): 2-hop information available to agent i (Equation 9)\n  //   sigma(t): Local attack detector module (Equation 30)\n  //   epsilon: Threshold for attack detection (Equation 33)\n  \n  for (let i = 0; i < cooperativeAgents.length; i++) {\n    // Assume the agent is initially not under attack\n    let isUnderAttack = false; \n    let maliciousNeighbors = [];\n\n    // Procedure 1: DISTRIBUTED DETECTION & ISOLATION\n    \n    // (Re)initialize local attack detector using most recent information\n    sigma.reinitialize(phi(t));\n    \n    // Compute residual and corresponding thresholds\n    let residual = sigma.computeResidual();\n    let thresholds = sigma.computeThresholds(); \n\n    // Check 1-hop neighbors for potential attacks\n    for (let j = 0; j < oneHopNeighbors[i].length; j++) {\n      if (Math.abs(residual[j]) > thresholds[j]) {\n        // Attack detected!\n        isUnderAttack = true; \n        maliciousNeighbors.push(oneHopNeighbors[i][j]);\n      }\n    }\n\n    if (isUnderAttack) {\n      // Stop communication with detected malicious neighbors\n      for (let k = 0; k < maliciousNeighbors.length; k++) {\n        disconnect(i, maliciousNeighbors[k]); \n      }\n      // Update 2-hop information to reflect changes\n      phi.update(i);\n    }\n\n    // Procedure 2: RESILIENT COOPERATION \n\n    // Run control protocol with updated neighbor information\n    runControlProtocol(i, oneHopNeighbors[i], maliciousNeighbors); \n  }\n}\n\n// Helper functions \n\nfunction disconnect(agent1, agent2) {\n  // Removes connection between agent1 and agent2\n  // ...\n}\n\nfunction runControlProtocol(agent, neighbors, maliciousNeighbors) {\n  // Implements control protocol (Equation 5)\n  // using information from neighbors and excluding malicious neighbors \n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThis JavaScript code implements Algorithm 1 for achieving resilient consensus and cooperation in a multi-agent system subject to deception and DoS attacks. The function `resilientCooperation` iterates through each cooperative agent, performing two main procedures:\n\n**1. DISTRIBUTED DETECTION & ISOLATION:**\n    * Each agent initializes its local attack detector module (`sigma`) using 2-hop information (`phi`).\n    * It computes residuals and dynamic thresholds based on observed data.\n    * If a residual for a neighbor exceeds its threshold, an attack is detected, and that neighbor is marked as malicious.\n    * Communication is stopped with detected malicious neighbors.\n\n**2. RESILIENT COOPERATION:**\n    * Each agent runs a control protocol (e.g., Equation 5) to achieve consensus or formation, excluding malicious neighbors from communication.\n\nThe code utilizes helper functions `disconnect` and `runControlProtocol` to handle communication disruptions and execute the control protocol, respectively. These functions would need to be implemented based on the specific communication protocols and control algorithms used in the multi-agent system. \n\n**Purpose:**\n\nThe algorithm aims to enable a group of agents to reach a common goal (consensus or formation) despite the presence of malicious agents and unreliable communication. It emphasizes distributed detection and adaptation, relying on local information and reconfiguration to achieve resilient cooperation.",
