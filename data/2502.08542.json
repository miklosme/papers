  "title": "Beyond Predictions: A Participatory Framework for Multi-Stakeholder Decision-Making",
  "abstract": "Conventional decision-support systems, primarily based on supervised learning, focus on outcome prediction models to recommend actions. However, they often fail to account for the complexities of multi-actor environments, where diverse and potentially conflicting stakeholder preferences must be balanced. In this paper, we propose a novel participatory framework that redefines decision-making as a multi-stakeholder optimization problem, capturing each actor's preferences through context-dependent reward functions. Our framework leverages k-fold cross-validation to fine-tune user-provided outcome prediction models and evaluate decision strategies, including compromise functions mediating stakeholder trade-offs. We introduce a synthetic scoring mechanism that exploits user-defined preferences across multiple metrics to rank decision-making strategies and identify the optimal decision-maker. The selected decision-maker can then be used to generate actionable recommendations for new data. We validate our framework using two real-world use cases, demonstrating its ability to deliver recommendations that effectively balance multiple metrics, achieving results that are often beyond the scope of purely prediction-based methods. Ablation studies demonstrate that our framework, with its modular, model-agnostic, and inherently transparent design, integrates seamlessly with various predictive models, reward structures, evaluation metrics, and sample sizes, making it particularly suited for complex, high-stakes decision-making contexts.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces a framework for multi-stakeholder decision-making that goes beyond simply predicting outcomes. It considers the preferences of multiple actors (e.g., bank, applicant, regulator in a loan scenario) by using reward functions for each actor, then combines these with outcome predictions to recommend actions that balance everyone's interests.  It uses compromise functions (e.g., maximizing total reward, ensuring equal reward distribution) to mediate between competing preferences.\n\nKey points for LLM-based multi-agent systems:\n\n* **Reward Modeling:** LLMs can be used to generate synthetic rewards representing different actor preferences, enabling experimentation with diverse stakeholder perspectives even without real-world data.  This also makes it easier to tailor reward functions to highly specific actor profiles.\n* **Compromise Functions:** The framework's concept of compromise functions allows for flexible integration of different LLM-driven agents, each potentially representing a different stakeholder or optimization strategy.  These agents can collaborate through the framework to arrive at a balanced decision.\n* **Explainability:** The framework's transparent design can be enhanced by LLMs to generate natural language explanations for the suggested actions, highlighting how different stakeholder interests are being considered and balanced.  This is crucial for building trust and understanding in multi-agent systems.\n* **Scalability:** The linear scalability of the framework, coupled with the ability of LLMs to handle complex relationships and model nuance, makes it promising for real-world applications with multiple agents and actions.\n* **Dynamic Interactions:**  The framework currently assumes non-adversarial interactions, but future work with LLMs could explore incorporating strategic behavior and adaptation within the decision-making process.",
  "takeaways": "This research paper presents a framework for incorporating stakeholder perspectives into AI decision-making, moving beyond single-objective optimization. Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights when building LLM-based multi-agent applications for the web:\n\n**1. Modeling Stakeholder Rewards:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine building a multi-agent chat application for collaborative writing. Stakeholders are authors, editors, and readers.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * Use JavaScript objects to define reward functions for each stakeholder. For instance, an author's reward function could prioritize creativity and originality (measurable via LLM-based metrics), while an editor's prioritizes clarity and conciseness.\n    ```javascript\n    const authorReward = (text) => {\n      const creativityScore = await llm.evaluateCreativity(text);\n      const originalityScore = await llm.evaluateOriginality(text);\n      return 0.6 * creativityScore + 0.4 * originalityScore;\n    };\n\n    const editorReward = (text) => {\n      const clarityScore = await llm.evaluateClarity(text);\n      const concisenessScore = await llm.evaluateConciseness(text);\n      return 0.7 * clarityScore + 0.3 * concisenessScore;\n    };\n    ```\n    * These `llm` functions would be wrappers around API calls to your chosen LLM service.  LangChain or similar tools could help streamline this.\n* **Framework Integration:** Incorporate these reward functions within the agent's decision-making logic using a JavaScript agent framework like Agent.js.\n\n**2. Implementing Compromise Functions:**\n\n* **Scenario:** In the collaborative writing app, different agents representing different stakeholders propose changes to the text.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * Implement compromise functions (e.g., Nash Bargaining Solution, Maximin) to aggregate stakeholder rewards.\n    ```javascript\n    const nashBargaining = (rewards) => {\n      // Calculate Nash Bargaining Solution based on rewards array\n      // ... (Implementation details using Nash bargaining logic)\n      return selectedAction;\n    };\n    ```\n* **Framework Integration:** Use a library like `nashjs` (if one exists; you may need to implement the algorithm yourself) to calculate solutions. Integrate the chosen compromise function within the agent's negotiation protocol in Agent.js.\n\n**3. Building an Interactive Interface:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  Allow users to adjust stakeholder weights and view the resulting changes in the text proposed by the agents.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * Use a front-end framework like React or Vue.js to build an interactive interface.\n    * Allow users to adjust slider controls representing stakeholder weights (e.g., importance of author vs. editor).\n    *  Display different versions of the text generated by different decision strategies in separate panels.\n\n**4. Evaluating and Refining the System:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Evaluate how different compromise functions affect the quality and fairness of the generated text.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** Collect user feedback on different text versions via A/B testing. Use LLM-based evaluation metrics (for fluency, coherence, etc.) to assess text quality.  Analyze logged data of agent interactions to understand the system's dynamics.\n\n\n**Example using a simplified scenario in a web app using React and a hypothetical LLM API:**\n\n```javascript\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\n// Mock LLM API calls (replace with actual API calls)\nconst llm = {\n  evaluateConciseness: async (text) => Math.random(),  // Example: replace with actual LLM call\n  evaluateClarity: async (text) => Math.random(),        // Example: replace with actual LLM call\n  generateText: async (prompt) => \"LLM generated text\" // Example: replace with actual LLM call\n};\n\nfunction App() {\n  const [text, setText] = useState(\"\");\n  const [editorWeight, setEditorWeight] = useState(0.5);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const generateTextWithWeights = async () => {\n      const concisenessScore = await llm.evaluateConciseness(text);\n      const clarityScore = await llm.evaluateClarity(text);\n\n      const weightedScore = (1 - editorWeight) * concisenessScore + editorWeight * clarityScore;\n      \n      const newText = await llm.generateText(`Improve this text based on the provided score: ${weightedScore}: ${text}`);\n      setText(newText);\n    }\n\n    generateTextWithWeights();\n\n  }, [text, editorWeight]);\n\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <textarea value={text} onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)} />\n      <label>Editor Weight:</label>\n      <input \n        type=\"range\" \n        min=\"0\" \n        max=\"1\" \n        step=\"0.1\" \n        value={editorWeight} \n        onChange={(e) => setEditorWeight(parseFloat(e.target.value))} \n      />\n      <p>Generated Text: {text}</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nexport default App;\n\n```\n\nBy incorporating these concepts, JavaScript developers can build LLM-powered multi-agent web applications that are not only effective but also consider the diverse needs and preferences of their users, fostering more equitable and participatory online experiences.  This field is rapidly evolving, so exploring existing libraries, contributing to new ones, and adopting a creative approach are crucial.",
