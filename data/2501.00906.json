  "title": "Large Language Model Based Multi-Agent System Augmented Complex Event Processing Pipeline for Internet of Multimedia Things",
  "abstract": "This paper presents the development and evaluation of a Large Language Model (LLM), also known as foundation models, based multi-agent system framework for complex event processing (CEP) with a focus on video query processing use cases. The primary goal is to create a proof-of-concept (POC) that integrates state-of-the-art LLM orchestration frameworks with publish/subscribe (pub/sub) tools to address the integration of LLMs with current CEP systems. Utilizing the Autogen framework in conjunction with Kafka message brokers, the system demonstrates an autonomous CEP pipeline capable of handling complex workflows. Extensive experiments evaluate the system's performance across varying configurations, complexities, and video resolutions, revealing the trade-offs between functionality and latency. The results show that while higher agent count and video complexities increase latency, the system maintains high consistency in narrative coherence. This research builds upon and contributes to, existing novel approaches to distributed AI systems, offering detailed insights into integrating such systems into existing infrastructures.",
  "summary": "This paper explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) within a multi-agent system to improve complex event processing (CEP), specifically for video analysis.  It presents a proof-of-concept using the Autogen framework and Kafka message broker.\n\nKey LLM-MAS points include: different agent types (conversable, assistant, user proxy) within Autogen facilitate complex workflows; integrating external tools and functions enhances agent capabilities and system robustness; increasing agent numbers improves functionality but also increases latency due to communication overhead; video complexity impacts processing time and accuracy, with lower resolutions improving speed but reducing detail; and dynamic speaker selection within the multi-agent conversation is crucial for efficiency.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents a compelling case for using LLM-powered multi-agent systems (MAS) in complex event processing (CEP), particularly relevant for modern web applications dealing with real-time data streams like video analysis. Let's translate the insights into practical examples for JavaScript developers.\n\n**Scenario: Real-time Collaborative Video Annotation Web App**\n\nImagine building a web app where multiple users can collaboratively annotate a live video stream.  LLM-powered agents can assist with object recognition, generating descriptions, suggesting tags, and even moderating content.\n\n**Example Implementation using JavaScript and Related Technologies:**\n\n1. **LLM Integration:** Use a JavaScript library like `langchain.js` to interact with an LLM API (e.g., OpenAI, Cohere). This will be the \"brain\" of your agents.\n\n2. **Agent Framework:** Implement a lightweight agent framework in JavaScript. Each agent can be an object with properties like:\n    * `role`:  (e.g., \"objectRecognizer,\" \"descriptionGenerator,\" \"moderator\")\n    * `llm`: An instance of the LLM wrapper.\n    * `state`:  Current context or memory.\n    * `actions`: Functions to perform actions based on LLM outputs.\n\n3. **Publish/Subscribe Mechanism:** Use a library like `socket.io` or a message broker like `kafka.js` to handle real-time communication.\n    * Video frames or metadata can be published to a topic.\n    * Agents subscribe to relevant topics (e.g., \"newFrame,\" \"annotationRequest\").\n\n4. **Agent Interaction:**\n    * The \"objectRecognizer\" agent subscribes to \"newFrame,\" processes it using the LLM to identify objects, and publishes the results to a \"recognizedObjects\" topic.\n    * The \"descriptionGenerator\" agent subscribes to \"recognizedObjects\" and generates descriptions for the recognized objects, publishing them to an \"annotations\" topic.\n    * The \"moderator\" agent subscribes to \"annotations,\" uses the LLM to check for inappropriate content, and can flag or remove annotations if necessary.\n\n5. **Frontend Integration:** Use a JavaScript frontend framework like React or Vue to display the video stream and annotations in real-time.\n\n**Code Example (Conceptual):**\n\n```javascript\n// Object Recognizer Agent\nconst objectRecognizer = {\n  role: \"objectRecognizer\",\n  llm: new LangChain(...), // LLM instance\n  actions: {\n    recognize: async (frameData) => {\n      const prompt = `Identify objects in this frame:\\n${frameData}`;\n      const response = await this.llm.call(prompt);\n      socket.emit(\"recognizedObjects\", response); // Publish results\n    },\n  },\n};\n\nsocket.on(\"newFrame\", (frameData) => {\n  objectRecognizer.actions.recognize(frameData);\n});\n```\n\n\n**Addressing Paper-Specific Insights:**\n\n* **Agent Overhead:** This example demonstrates task distribution amongst agents, which reduces individual agent complexity, akin to the paper's observation on improving performance with more specialized agents. Monitor and optimize agent communication overhead as highlighted in the paper.\n* **Video Complexity:**  Implement a pre-processing stage on the edge (client-side JavaScript) to reduce video complexity before sending it to the LLM. For example, reduce resolution or frame rate, or extract regions of interest, similar to how the paper discussed the impact of video resolution.\n* **External Tools:** Integrate external libraries for computer vision tasks directly into your JavaScript agents using `node.js` on the server or WebAssembly on the client. This mirrors the paper's emphasis on using tools within the agent framework.\n\n\n**Other Web Development Applications:**\n\n* **Real-time chatbots with specialized roles:** Agents can handle different aspects of a conversation, like customer service, technical support, or sales.\n* **Collaborative document editing:** Agents can assist with grammar, style, fact-checking, and generating content.\n* **Personalized news feeds:** Agents can filter and summarize news articles based on user preferences.\n\n\nBy combining the power of LLMs, the flexibility of multi-agent systems, and the real-time capabilities of web technologies, JavaScript developers can build truly innovative and intelligent web applications.  This paper provides a blueprint for getting started and highlights key considerations for building effective and efficient LLM-based multi-agent applications.",
