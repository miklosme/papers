  "title": "Transformer Guided Coevolution: Improved Team Formation in Multiagent Adversarial Games",
  "abstract": "We consider the problem of team formation within multiagent adversarial games. We propose BERTeam, a novel algorithm that uses a transformer-based deep neural network with Masked Language Model training to select the best team of players from a trained population. We integrate this with coevolutionary deep reinforcement learning, which trains a diverse set of individual players to choose teams from. We test our algorithm in the multiagent adversarial game Marine Capture-The-Flag, and we find that BERTeam learns non-trivial team compositions that perform well against unseen opponents. For this game, we find that BERTeam outperforms MCAA, an algorithm that similarly optimizes team formation.",
  "summary": "This paper proposes BERTeam, a novel algorithm using a transformer-based neural network to improve team formation in multi-agent adversarial games.  \n\nKey points for LLM-based multi-agent systems:\n\n* **Sequence generation for team selection:**  BERTeam treats team selection as a sequence completion task, using a transformer to predict optimal agent combinations.\n* **Trained alongside coevolution:** BERTeam learns concurrently with individual agent policy training, leveraging game outcomes to refine its understanding of successful teams. \n* **Learns agent similarities:**  Similar to word embeddings in NLP, BERTeam learns vector representations of agents, encoding their behavior and enabling it to infer missing information about potential team compositions.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents a fascinating approach to team formation in multi-agent AI, particularly relevant for JavaScript developers looking to incorporate LLMs into their projects. Here are some practical takeaways and examples:\n\n**1. LLM-powered Team Selection:**\n\n* **Concept:** Instead of hard-coding team compositions, use an LLM to learn and predict effective teams based on agent skills and past performance. \n* **JavaScript Implementation:**  \n    * **Training Data:**  Collect gameplay data, representing agent skills as vectors (e.g., communication effectiveness, task completion rate).\n    * **LLM Fine-tuning:**  Fine-tune a pre-trained LLM (like GPT-2 or Jurassic-1 Jumbo) in JavaScript using a library like `transformers.js` or `node-tensorflow`. Feed the LLM historical gameplay data, masking team compositions and having it predict the missing agents.\n    * **Team Prediction:** During gameplay, provide the LLM with the current agent pool. It will output a probability distribution over possible team combinations, allowing you to select the most promising team. \n\n**2. Agent Behavior Embeddings:**\n\n* **Concept:** Represent agent behavior as numerical vectors (embeddings) that capture their playing style. Similar agents will have similar embeddings, allowing the LLM to generalize better.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * **Behavior Tracking:**  Log agent actions during gameplay (e.g., \"moved to location X,\" \"sent message Y,\" \"completed task Z\").\n    * **Embedding Generation:** Use a JavaScript machine learning library like `TensorFlow.js` or `brain.js` to train a model (e.g., Word2Vec, autoencoder) that maps action sequences to embeddings.\n    * **LLM Integration:**  When querying the LLM for team suggestions, include these agent embeddings as input.  \n\n**Web Development Scenarios:**\n\n* **Cooperative Game Development:** In multiplayer games using Node.js and Socket.IO, dynamically form teams based on player skills, fostering balanced and engaging gameplay.\n* **Collaborative Project Management Tools:** Imagine a project management app using React where tasks are automatically assigned to teams of users based on their expertise and past collaboration success (tracked as embeddings).\n* **AI-powered Chatbots:** In a customer support system built with Dialogflow or Rasa, create teams of specialized chatbots (each with its own LLM) that can seamlessly collaborate to address complex user requests.\n\n**JavaScript Frameworks/Libraries:**\n\n* **TensorFlow.js/brain.js:**  For training and using machine learning models in the browser or on a Node.js server.\n* **transformers.js:** For loading and running pre-trained LLMs directly in JavaScript.\n* **Socket.IO:**  For real-time communication in multiplayer games and collaborative web applications.\n\n**Key Takeaway:** This research empowers JavaScript developers to build more intelligent and adaptive multi-agent applications. By leveraging the power of LLMs and agent embeddings, we can create systems that learn effective collaboration strategies, leading to more dynamic and engaging user experiences.",

It aims to train a population of agents to play a multi-agent adversarial game (like the Capture the Flag game used in the paper). \n\n**Key Components:**\n\n1. **`trainPopulationCoevolution(population, teamSize)`:** This is the main function that orchestrates the training process. It iterates through epochs, plays games, updates agent policies and fitness, and evolves the population.\n2. **`sampleTeams(population, teamSize)`:** This helper function is responsible for randomly selecting two teams of agents from the population for each game.\n3. **`selectCaptains(team1, team2)`:**  This function selects captain agents for each team. Captains could have special roles or be used for fitness evaluation.\n4. **`playGame(team1, team2)`:** This function executes the actual game logic using the chosen teams and returns the game's outcomes and the experience trajectories for each agent (states, actions, rewards).\n5. **`updateFitness(captain1, captain2, outcomes)`:** This function updates the fitness value of captain agents based on the game's outcome, likely using an Elo rating system.\n6. **`updatePopulation(population, fitnessValues)`:** This function implements the evolutionary aspect of the algorithm. Based on the fitness values, it decides which agents to clone (reproduce) and which to remove to maintain population diversity and improve overall performance.\n\n**Purpose:**\n\nThe overall purpose of this algorithm is to find a population of diverse and well-performing agents that can successfully play the specified multi-agent adversarial game. The coevolutionary approach ensures that agents are constantly adapting to each other's strategies, leading to robust policies.\n\nThis code is a high-level implementation and requires further development of the helper functions and integration with a game environment and specific reinforcement learning algorithms (like PPO) to be fully functional.",
