  "title": "STACKFEED: STRUCTURED TEXTUAL ACTOR-CRITIC KNOWLEDGE BASE EDITING WITH FEEDBACK",
  "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate incorrect or outdated information, especially in low-resource settings or when dealing with private data. To address this, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) uses external knowledge bases (KBs), but these can also suffer from inaccuracies. We introduce STACKFEED, a novel Structured Textual Actor-Critic Knowledge base editing with FEEDback approach that iteratively refines the KB based on expert feedback using a multi-actor, centralized critic reinforcement learning framework. Each document is assigned to an actor, modeled as a ReACT agent, which performs structured edits based on document-specific targeted instructions from a centralized critic. Experimental results show that STACKFEED significantly improves KB quality and RAG system performance, enhancing accuracy by up to 8% over baselines.",
  "summary": "- **Main Topic:** This paper proposes STACKFEED, a system for improving the accuracy of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by automatically refining knowledge bases (KB) using expert feedback. \n\n- **Key Points for LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems:**\n    - STACKFEED employs a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework with a central critic (for global feedback analysis) and document-specific actors (to execute edits).\n    -  Emphasizes structured editing of KB documents, making edits targeted and manageable even for large documents.\n    -  Proposes metrics to evaluate the quality of KB edits in terms of completeness, generalizability, and coherence.\n    - Could be useful for LLM applications requiring dynamic KB updates without full model retraining, like chatbots or code generation tools.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents STACKFEED as a way to improve the accuracy of information in LLMs, especially for Javascript developers working with RAG systems. Here's how a Javascript developer could put those ideas into practice:\n\n**Scenario:** Imagine building a chatbot for a web app that helps users with Javascript coding problems. The chatbot uses an LLM and a knowledge base of Javascript documentation.\n\n**Problem:** The LLM sometimes generates incorrect or outdated code snippets because the documentation in the knowledge base is not perfect. \n\n**Solution: Implement STACKFEED using JavaScript and available tools:**\n\n1. **Multi-Agent System Setup:**\n\n   * **Centralized Critic (Node.js server):**\n     * Use Node.js to create a central server that receives feedback (e.g., user reports of incorrect code, compiler errors) and the generated code. \n     * **Reflection Generation:** Implement the \"reflection\" generation using a powerful LLM like GPT-4 (API integration). The reflection should analyze why the generated code was wrong in relation to the retrieved documentation.\n     * **Document Selection:** Use a similarity algorithm (like cosine similarity from a library like `ml-similarity`) to identify which documentation files are most relevant to the error.\n     * **Document-Wise Reflection:**  Split the overall reflection into smaller, document-specific reflections.\n   * **Actors (Individual Node.js processes or serverless functions):**\n     * Create separate actors (Node.js processes/serverless functions) for each document in your knowledge base. \n     * Each actor receives its document-specific reflection from the critic.\n     * **ReACT Agent:** Implement a simplified version of the ReACT agent logic using JavaScript. This agent will propose specific edits to the document based on the received reflection (e.g., add a missing explanation, correct outdated information). Libraries like `jsdiff` can help with comparing and generating text diffs.\n\n2. **JavaScript Libraries and Tools:**\n\n   * **LLM Integration:** Use JavaScript libraries like `langchainjs` to integrate with LLMs for reflection generation.\n   * **Text Similarity:** Employ libraries like `ml-similarity` or `natural` to calculate text similarity for document selection.\n   * **Diffing and Patching:** Use libraries like `jsdiff` or `diff-match-patch` to calculate text differences and apply edits to documents.\n   * **Communication:** Leverage WebSockets or a message queue (like Redis) for real-time communication between the critic and actors.\n\n**Practical Implementation:**\n\n```javascript\n// Example (simplified) actor logic in JavaScript\nconst jsdiff = require('jsdiff'); \n\nasync function updateDocument(documentId, reflection) {\n  // 1. Load the document from your knowledge base\n  const document = await loadDocument(documentId); \n\n  // 2.  Implement ReACT agent logic (simplified)\n  const proposedEdits = await generateEdits(document, reflection); // Use LLM for suggestions\n\n  // 3.  Calculate and apply the edits (diff and patch)\n  const diff = jsdiff.diffWords(document.content, proposedEdits);\n  const updatedDocument = applyPatch(document.content, diff);\n\n  // 4. Save the updated document\n  await saveDocument(documentId, updatedDocument);\n}\n```\n\n**Benefits for JavaScript Developers:**\n\n* **Improved Code Generation:** The chatbot will generate more accurate and up-to-date code, improving the user experience.\n* **Dynamic Knowledge Base:** The knowledge base stays current without manual intervention.\n* **Modular Design:** The multi-agent architecture allows for scalable updates and maintenance of your knowledge base.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* STACKFEED offers a practical way to address inaccuracies in LLMs by refining their knowledge bases.\n* JavaScript developers can readily implement these concepts using existing libraries and tools.\n* Multi-agent AI has the potential to significantly enhance web application development, particularly in areas like chatbots, code assistants, and personalized content delivery.",
