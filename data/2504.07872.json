  "title": "DUAL ENGINES OF THOUGHTS: A DEPTH-BREADTH INTEGRATION FRAMEWORK FOR OPEN-ENDED ANALYSIS",
  "abstract": "We propose the Dual Engines of Thoughts (DEoT), an analytical framework for comprehensive open-ended reasoning. While traditional reasoning frameworks primarily focus on finding \"the best answer\" or \"the correct answer\" for single-answer problems, DEoT is specifically designed for \"open-ended questions,” enabling both broader and deeper analytical exploration. The framework centers on three key components: a Base Prompter for refining user queries, a Solver Agent that orchestrates task decomposition, execution, and validation, and a Dual-Engine System consisting of a Breadth Engine (to explore diverse impact factors) and a Depth Engine (to perform deep investigations). This integrated design allows DEoT to balance wide-ranging coverage with in-depth analysis, and it is highly customizable, enabling users to adjust analytical parameters and tool configurations based on specific requirements. Experimental results show that DEoT excels in addressing complex, multi-faceted questions, achieving a total win rate of 77-86% compared to existing reasoning models, thus highlighting its effectiveness in real-world applications.",
  "summary": "The paper introduces DEoT (Dual Engines of Thoughts), a framework for answering complex, open-ended questions more effectively than current models by combining breadth-first and depth-first analysis.\n\nKey points:\n\n* **Dual-Engine System:** DEoT uses a breadth-first engine to explore diverse impact factors broadly, followed by a depth-first engine to perform targeted deep dives, mimicking human brainstorming.  An \"engine controller\" manages which engine is active.\n* **Multi-agent Architecture:** DEoT leverages specialized agents (news searcher, event extractor, history analyzer, etc.) within a modular framework.  These agents function similarly to tools used in LLM-based multi-agent systems.\n* **Relevance to LLMs:** DEoT uses LLMs (specifically GPT-4 and PerplexityAI's Llama) for various tasks, showcasing potential integration with LLM-based multi-agent systems.  The paper emphasizes the limitations of existing LLMs in handling complex open-ended reasoning.\n* **Focus on Open-Ended Questions:**  Addresses the gap in LLM benchmarks focused on single-answer tasks, proposing a dataset (N2Q) based on open-ended follow-up questions to news articles. This is relevant to multi-agent systems that need to tackle complex, multifaceted problems.\n* **Evaluation using LLMs:**  Employs GPT-4 as an evaluation agent, assessing performance based on multiple criteria (analytical depth, specific arguments, innovation, practicality, logical coherence), which is a valuable approach for evaluating multi-agent system outputs.",
  "takeaways": "This paper introduces DEoT (Dual Engines of Thoughts), a framework for multi-agent, open-ended analytical tasks.  Let's translate its key concepts into actionable JavaScript examples for LLM-powered multi-agent web apps.\n\n**Core Concepts & JavaScript Implementation**\n\n1. **Base Prompter (Query Refinement):**\n\n   * **Concept:**  Optimizes user queries for clarity and context.\n   * **JavaScript Example:** Imagine a user asks, \"What's happening with Tesla?\"  A JavaScript function using a library like `compromise` for Natural Language Processing (NLP) could refine this into \"What is Tesla's stock performance and recent news in the last month?\"\n\n     ```javascript\n     import nlp from 'compromise';\n\n     function refineQuery(query) {\n       const doc = nlp(query);\n       if (doc.has('tesla')) { // Entity recognition\n         return `What is Tesla's stock performance and recent news in the last month?`;\n       }\n       // ... other refinement logic\n     }\n     ```\n\n2. **Solver Agent (Task Orchestration):**\n\n   * **Concept:** Breaks down complex queries into sub-tasks for specialized agents.\n   * **JavaScript Example:**  The refined query above could be split into tasks for news retrieval, sentiment analysis, and financial data retrieval.  You can use a task queue like `Bull` or a message broker like `Redis` to manage these tasks:\n\n     ```javascript\n     import Bull from 'bull';\n\n     const newsQueue = new Bull('news-retrieval');\n     newsQueue.add({ query: 'Tesla stock news', lastMonth: true });\n\n     const sentimentQueue = new Bull('sentiment-analysis');\n     // ... and so on.\n     ```\n\n3. **Dual-Engine System (Breadth & Depth):**\n\n   * **Concept:** Balances broad exploration (Breadth Engine) with deep dives (Depth Engine) into specific areas.\n   * **JavaScript Example:**  A news analysis app could use the Breadth Engine to gather news from diverse sources (using APIs for Reuters, NYT, etc.) and the Depth Engine to perform detailed sentiment analysis on articles related to a specific event (e.g., a product launch).  Langchain can be leveraged for building chains that would use LLMs to execute those tasks.\n\n     ```javascript\n     // Breadth Engine (Simplified Example)\n     const newsSources = ['Reuters', 'NYT', 'Bloomberg'];\n     const newsPromises = newsSources.map(source => fetchNewsFromSource(source, 'Tesla'));\n     Promise.all(newsPromises).then(analyzeNews);\n\n\n     // Depth Engine - Triggered by interesting news\n     function analyzeNews(news) {\n        // ...if sentiment is strongly negative and relevant to stock...\n       depthEngine.add({ article: articleContent, type: 'sentiment-deep-dive' });\n     }\n     ```\n\n4. **Analysis Toolbox (Specialized Agents):**\n\n   * **Concept:** Collection of tools for news search, event extraction, historical analysis, etc.\n   * **JavaScript Example:**  Langchain enables developers to integrate external tools in chains including news APIs, financial data APIs (e.g., `Alpha Vantage`), sentiment analysis libraries (e.g., `Sentiment`), or LLMs themselves.\n5. **Multi-Criteria Evaluation (Using GPT-4):**\n\n   * **Concept:**  Evaluate responses based on depth, argumentation, innovation, etc. using GPT-4 as a judge.\n   * **JavaScript Example:** Integrate a GPT-4 API call into your workflow, sending both user queries and the multi-agent system's response for evaluation based on the criteria defined in the paper.\n\n     ```javascript\n     async function evaluateResponse(query, response) {\n       const gpt4Response = await callGPT4({\n         prompt: `Evaluate this response to the query: \\n Query: ${query} \\n Response: ${response} \\n Criteria: [Analytical Depth, Specific Arguments, Innovation, Practicality, Logical Coherence]`,\n       });\n       // ... Parse and use the GPT-4 evaluation data\n     }\n     ```\n\n**Web Development Scenarios**\n\n* **Financial Analysis Dashboard:**  Provide multi-faceted insights into market trends.\n* **Automated News Summarization:**  Summarize news with different levels of detail, allowing users to \"zoom in\" for deeper analysis.\n* **Customer Support Bots:** Intelligent bots that can explore different avenues of support, adapting to user needs dynamically.\n\nBy implementing these concepts, JavaScript developers can create sophisticated, intelligent web apps leveraging the power of LLMs and multi-agent systems for enhanced user experiences and complex problem-solving.  The DEoT framework provides a conceptual roadmap for building these kinds of applications, emphasizing the crucial balance between broad exploration and focused, in-depth analysis.",
  "pseudocode": "No pseudocode block found.  The paper describes the architecture and functionality of DEoT, a multi-agent system for open-ended analysis, but doesn't provide pseudocode implementations of its components. The prompts themselves, while detailed, act as instructions for the LLMs and don't represent algorithmic pseudocode. They define the desired behavior and format of the LLMs' outputs but don't specify the underlying computational steps.  Therefore, there is nothing to translate into JavaScript.",
