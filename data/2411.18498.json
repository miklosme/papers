  "title": "COLLECTIVE DECISION MAKING BY EMBODIED NEURAL AGENTS",
  "abstract": "Collective decision making using simple social interactions has been studied in many types of multi-agent systems, including robot swarms and human social networks. However, existing multi-agent studies have rarely modeled the neural dynamics that underlie sensorimotor coordination in embodied biological agents. In this study, we investigated collective decisions that resulted from sensorimotor coordination among agents with simple neural dynamics. We equipped our agents with a model of minimal neural dynamics based on the coordination dynamics framework, and embedded them in an environment with a stimulus gradient. In our single-agent setup, the decision between two stimulus sources depends solely on the coordination of the agent's neural dynamics with its environment. In our multi-agent setup, that same decision also depends on the sensorimotor coordination between agents, via their simple social interactions. Our results show that the success of collective decisions depended on a balance of intra-agent, inter-agent, and agent-environment coupling, and we use these results to identify the influences of environmental factors on decision difficulty. More generally, our results demonstrate the impact of intra- and inter-brain coordination dynamics on collective behavior, can contribute to existing knowledge on the functional role of inter-agent synchrony, and are relevant to ongoing developments in neuro-AI and self-organized multi-agent systems.",
  "summary": "This research explores how simple, embodied agents with internal neural dynamics, modeled using coupled oscillators, can make collective decisions.  The agents interact with each other and the environment, influencing their internal dynamics and their movement towards stimulus sources.  The study finds that a balance between internal dynamics, environmental sensitivity, and social influence is crucial for effective collective decision-making.\n\nFor LLM-based multi-agent systems, this work highlights the importance of:\n\n* **Embodiment:** Grounding agent behavior in a simulated environment, even a simple one, significantly affects how the agents interact and make decisions.\n* **Internal Dynamics:** Giving agents internal states, even simple oscillatory ones, allows them to be more than just reactive components, providing a mechanism for balancing external influences and achieving nuanced collective behaviors.\n* **Balancing Influences:** The right balance of environmental perception, inter-agent communication, and internally driven processes is essential for effective collective outcomes, suggesting that similar considerations might be relevant for designing LLM-based multi-agent systems.\n* **Emergent Behavior:** The simple interactions between the agents' internal dynamics, the environment, and each other can lead to complex and sometimes unexpected collective behaviors, suggesting that focusing on these low-level interactions can be a powerful approach in multi-agent system design.",
  "takeaways": "This research paper explores how simple embodied agents with oscillatory neural dynamics can achieve collective decision-making.  Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights to LLM-based multi-agent AI projects, focusing on web development:\n\n**Conceptual Translation to JavaScript/Web Development:**\n\n* **Agents as JavaScript Objects:** Each agent from the paper can be represented as a JavaScript object with properties like `internalCoupling`, `stimulusSensitivity`, `socialInfluence`, `phase`, and `position`.\n* **Environment as a Data Structure:** The stimulus landscape can be a 2D array or a more complex object representing the web application's state or data.  For example, in a collaborative writing app, the environment could represent the document itself.\n* **Neural Dynamics as Functions:** The oscillatory dynamics (HKB equations) can be implemented as JavaScript functions updating the `phase` of each agent based on its internal state and perceived stimuli.\n* **Sensorimotor Loop with Event Handlers:** The interaction with the environment can be modeled using event handlers.  For example, in a collaborative design tool, an agent's \"sensor\" could be triggered when another agent modifies the canvas.  The \"motor\" response would then be an update to the agent's own actions, mediated by the neural dynamics function.\n* **Social Interaction via WebSockets:** Real-time communication between agents can be implemented using WebSockets or similar technologies, allowing agents to broadcast their state and influence each other's `phase`.\n\n**Practical Examples:**\n\n1. **Collaborative Writing Application:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Multiple users (agents) collaborate on a single document. Each agent's writing style is influenced by others and by the content itself.\n* **Implementation:**  Each agent (user) is a JavaScript object.  The document is the environment. The HKB equations simulate an agent's writing process, influenced by other agents' contributions (via WebSockets) and the existing document content.  A JavaScript framework like React could manage the UI and data flow. Libraries like TensorFlow.js could handle the more complex aspects of the neural dynamics if the HKB equations are extended with LLMs.\n\n2. **Multi-Agent Chatbot for Customer Service:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  A team of specialized chatbots (agents) collaborates to answer customer queries. Each bot focuses on a specific area (e.g., billing, technical support), and they can consult each other when needed.\n* **Implementation:** Each chatbot is a JavaScript object.  The conversation history and customer query form the environment.  The internal coupling reflects a bot's confidence in its own knowledge. Social influence is the degree to which a bot considers other bots' suggestions. WebSockets enable communication and information exchange between bots.  A framework like Node.js and a library like LangChain for integrating LLMs into agents could be beneficial here.\n\n3. **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) Visualization:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Visualize the decision-making process within a DAO, where agents (members) vote on proposals.\n* **Implementation:**  Each DAO member is a JavaScript object.  The proposals and voting status form the environment. The neural dynamics simulate the members' opinion formation, influenced by other members' votes and the proposal content. A library like D3.js can be used for visualizing the evolving dynamics and consensus formation.\n\n**Key Considerations for JavaScript Developers:**\n\n* **Balance of Influences:**  Carefully tune the parameters (`internalCoupling`, `stimulusSensitivity`, `socialInfluence`) to achieve the desired behavior.  Too much social influence can lead to groupthink, while too much internal coupling can make agents unresponsive to the environment.\n* **Scalability:**  For large numbers of agents, optimize the implementation of the neural dynamics and communication to avoid performance bottlenecks.\n* **Visualization:**  Use JavaScript visualization libraries like D3.js or Chart.js to monitor the system's dynamics and understand the emergent behavior.\n\n\nBy translating the core principles of this research into JavaScript and leveraging the power of LLMs, developers can create innovative and engaging web applications with multi-agent AI systems.  The research offers a starting point for exploring more complex scenarios, integrating advanced LLM capabilities, and ultimately building more intelligent and adaptive web experiences.",
  "pseudocode": "No pseudocode block found. However, the paper describes mathematical equations related to the HKB model and agent behavior. These can be converted into JavaScript functions.  Here are a few key examples:\n\n**1. HKB Equation for N Oscillators (Equation 1 & S6):**\n\n```javascript\nfunction updateOscillatorPhase(phi_i, omega_i, I_i, c, a, b) {\n  let sum = 0;\n  for (let j = 0; j < N; j++) { // N is the total number of oscillators\n    if (i !== j) {  // An oscillator doesn't interact with itself\n      const phi_diff = phi_i - phi[j]; // phi[] stores the phases of all oscillators\n      sum += a[i][j] * Math.sin(phi_diff) + 2 * b[i][j] * Math.sin(2 * phi_diff);\n    }\n  }\n  return omega_i + c * I_i - sum; \n}\n\n// Example Usage (for oscillator 0):\nlet phi = [0, 0, 0, 0]; // Initial phases\nlet omega = [5, 5, 5, 5]; // Intrinsic frequencies (5Hz as in the paper)\nlet I = [0.5, 0.2, 0, 0]; // Sensory input (only for sensory oscillators)\nlet c = [3, 3, 0, 0]; // Stimulus sensitivity (only for sensory oscillators)\nlet a = [[0, 0, 0.5, 0.5], [0, 0, 0.5, 0.5], [0.5, 0.5, 0, 0.8], [0.5, 0.5, 0.8, 0]]; // Coupling matrix 'a'\nlet b = [[0, 0, 0.25, 0.25], [0, 0, 0.25, 0.25], [0.25, 0.25, 0, 0.4], [0.25, 0.25, 0.4, 0]]; // Coupling matrix 'b'\nlet N = 4;\n\nlet newPhi_0 = updateOscillatorPhase(phi[0], omega[0], I[0], c[0], a[0], b[0]);\n\nphi[0] = newPhi_0; // Update the phase\n```\n\n* **Explanation:** This function calculates the change in phase for a given oscillator (`phi_i`) based on its intrinsic frequency (`omega_i`), sensory input (`I_i`), stimulus sensitivity (`c`), and coupling with other oscillators (defined by the `a` and `b` matrices). The function would be called in a loop for each oscillator in the system, and the `phi` array updated accordingly.\n\n**2. Agent Orientation (Equation 2 & S8):**\n\n```javascript\nfunction getAgentOrientation(phi_3, phi_4, eta) {\n  return eta * (phi_3 - phi_4);\n}\n\n// Example usage\nlet theta = getAgentOrientation(phi[2], phi[3], 0.1); // eta is a scaling factor\n```\n\n* **Explanation:** This function calculates the agent's orientation (`theta`) based on the phase difference between its two motor oscillators (`phi_3`, `phi_4`) and a scaling factor (`eta`).\n\n\n**3. Stimulus from Environment and Other Agents (Equation 3 & 6):**\n\n```javascript\nfunction getStimulus(x, y, r, agentPositions, S, lambda_d, lambda_s) {\n  let stimulus = Math.exp(-lambda_d * distanceToSource1(x, y)) +  // Stimulus from source 1\n                r * Math.exp(-lambda_d * distanceToSource2(x, y)); // Stimulus from source 2\n\n  for (let j = 0; j < agentPositions.length; j++) {\n      if (agentPositions[j].id !== agentId) { // Agent doesn't sense itself\n          const dist = distance(x, y, agentPositions[j].x, agentPositions[j].y);\n          stimulus += S * Math.exp(-lambda_s * dist); // Social Stimulus\n      }\n  }\n  return stimulus;\n}\n\nfunction distance(x1, y1, x2, y2) {\n  return Math.sqrt(Math.pow(x1 - x2, 2) + Math.pow(y1 - y2, 2));\n}\n\n\n// Example source positions (you'll need to define these based on your environment)\nfunction distanceToSource1(x, y) {\n    return distance(x, y, -100, 0);\n}\n\nfunction distanceToSource2(x, y) {\n    return distance(x, y, 100, 0);\n}\n```\n\n* **Explanation:** This function calculates the total stimulus perceived by an agent at position (x, y).  It includes stimulus from two sources in the environment and stimulus emitted by other agents (`agentPositions`). The `r` parameter controls the relative strength of the second stimulus source, `S` is the strength of social influence, and `lambda_d` and `lambda_s` are the decay rates of environmental and social stimuli respectively.  The agent's own ID would need to be maintained to prevent self-sensing.\n\nThese JavaScript snippets demonstrate how the core mathematical concepts from the paper can be translated into a form suitable for implementation in a JavaScript-based multi-agent simulation.  Remember that a full simulation would require additional code for agent movement, environment representation, and visualization. These functions provide the basis for the agents' neural dynamics and interaction with the environment and each other.",
