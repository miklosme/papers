  "title": "Heterogeneous Decision Making in Mixed Traffic: Uncertainty-aware Planning and Bounded Rationality",
  "abstract": "The past few years have witnessed a rapid growth of the deployment of automated vehicles (AVs). Clearly, AVs and human-driven vehicles (HVs) will co-exist for many years, and AVs will have to operate around HVs, pedestrians, cyclists, and more, calling for fundamental breakthroughs in AI designed for mixed traffic to achieve mixed autonomy. Thus motivated, we study heterogeneous decision making by AVs and HVs in a mixed traffic environment, aiming to capture the interactions between human and machine decision-making and develop an AI foundation that enables vehicles to operate safely and efficiently. There are a number of challenges to achieve mixed autonomy, including 1) humans drivers make driving decisions with bounded rationality, and it remains open to develop accurate models for HVs' decision making; and 2) uncertainty-aware planning plays a critical role for AVs to take safety maneuvers in response to the human behavior. In this paper, we introduce a formulation of AV-HV interaction, where the HV makes decisions with bounded rationality and the AV employs uncertainty-aware planning based on the prediction on HV's future actions. We conduct a comprehensive analysis on AV and HV's learning regret to answer the questions: 1) How does the learning performance depend on HV's bounded rationality and AV's planning; 2) How do different decision making strategies impact the overall learning performance? Our findings reveal some intriguing phenomena, such as Goodhart's Law in AV's learning performance and compounding effects in HV's decision making process. By examining the dynamics of the regrets, we gain insights into the interplay between human and machine decision making.",
  "summary": "This paper studies how automated vehicles (AVs) and human-driven vehicles (HVs) can make decisions in mixed traffic.  It focuses on how an AV's planning algorithm and the HV's bounded rationality (simplified, sub-optimal decision-making) impact overall system efficiency.\n\nFor LLM-based multi-agent systems, the key takeaways are:  (1) Modeling bounded rationality of other agents is crucial, especially when dealing with \"noisy\" human-like behavior. (2)  The \"lookahead\" planning horizon of an agent (like the AV) needs to be carefully tuned, as excessively long horizons can worsen performance due to compounding prediction errors (Goodhart's Law).  (3) This research provides a theoretical framework for analyzing regret (performance loss compared to optimal) in multi-agent settings, which could be adapted for other LLM-agent interactions.  (4)  Prioritizing improvements in predicting other agents' actions provides larger performance gains compared to improvements in individual agent decision-making models.",
  "takeaways": "This research paper provides valuable insights for JavaScript developers working with LLM-based multi-agent systems in web applications. Here are some practical examples illustrating how its concepts can be applied:\n\n**1. Modeling Bounded Rationality in HVs (Human-like Agents):**\n\n* **Scenario:** Building a multi-agent simulation for a traffic management system where some agents represent human drivers.\n* **Application:**  Instead of assuming perfect rationality, developers can use the paper's insights to model human-like limitations.  This could be implemented by introducing stochasticity (randomness) and limitations to the agent's decision-making process. For example, a human driver agent might randomly choose a suboptimal route or have a delayed reaction time.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n```javascript\n// Example using a simple probability for suboptimal decision\nfunction humanDriverAgent(currentState) {\n  const optimalRoute = calculateOptimalRoute(currentState);\n  if (Math.random() < 0.2) { // 20% chance of suboptimal decision\n    return chooseSuboptimalRoute(currentState);\n  } else {\n    return optimalRoute;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**2. Implementing Uncertainty-Aware Planning in AVs (Autonomous Vehicle Agents):**\n\n* **Scenario:** Developing a collaborative web app where LLM-powered autonomous agents interact in a shared environment.\n* **Application:** AV agents should anticipate and adapt to uncertainties arising from other agents' bounded rationality. Developers can implement this by incorporating lookahead planning (as described in the paper) using libraries like TensorFlow.js or Web Workers for efficient parallel computations.\n* **JavaScript Implementation (Conceptual):**\n```javascript\n// Simplified example with a 2-step lookahead\nfunction autonomousAgent(currentState, otherAgents) {\n  let bestAction = null;\n  let bestValue = -Infinity;\n\n  for (const action of possibleActions) {\n    let expectedValue = 0;\n    for (const otherAgent of otherAgents) {\n      const predictedAction = predictOtherAgentAction(otherAgent, currentState, action); // Predict other agent's action considering uncertainty\n      const nextState = calculateNextState(currentState, action, predictedAction);\n      expectedValue += estimateValue(nextState);\n    }\n    if (expectedValue > bestValue) {\n      bestValue = expectedValue;\n      bestAction = action;\n    }\n  }\n  return bestAction;\n}\n```\n\n**3. Addressing the Goodhart's Law in Lookahead Planning:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  A multi-agent online game where LLM agents compete for resources.\n* **Application:** Developers need to be mindful of the trade-off between the length of the lookahead horizon and the accuracy of predictions.  Excessively long lookahead may lead to compounding errors, as described by Goodhart's Law. Experimentation and fine-tuning the lookahead horizon are crucial.\n* **JavaScript Implementation (Conceptual):**\n```javascript\n// Experiment with different lookahead horizons\nlet lookaheadHorizon = 3; // Initial value\n\nfunction adjustLookahead(performanceMetric) {\n  if (performanceMetric < threshold) {\n    lookaheadHorizon = Math.max(1, lookaheadHorizon - 1); // Decrease if performance drops\n  } else {\n    lookaheadHorizon += 1; // Increase if performance is good\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**4. Visualizing Regret Dynamics:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  A simulation environment built with Three.js or Babylon.js, visualizing the interaction of multiple LLM agents.\n* **Application:** Track and visualize the regret of each agent over time.  This allows developers to understand the learning dynamics and identify areas for improvement in agent design.  A JavaScript charting library like Chart.js or D3.js can be used for visualization.\n\n**5. Utilizing JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries:**\n\n* **Langchain.js:**  Can be used to manage prompts and responses from LLMs, integrating them into agent decision-making.\n* **TensorFlow.js:** Useful for implementing more sophisticated prediction models within the agents.\n* **Web Workers:** Allow offloading computationally intensive tasks like lookahead planning to separate threads, improving the responsiveness of the web application.\n\n\n\nBy considering these practical examples and using the capabilities of JavaScript frameworks and libraries, developers can translate the insights of the research paper into real-world web applications featuring LLM-based multi-agent systems.  The key takeaways are to incorporate bounded rationality, implement uncertainty-aware planning, manage lookahead horizons, and monitor performance metrics like regret.",
