  "title": "Self-Resource Allocation in Multi-Agent LLM Systems",
  "abstract": "With the development of LLMs as agents, there is a growing interest in connecting multiple agents into multi-agent systems to solve tasks concurrently, focusing on their role in task assignment and coordination. This paper explores how LLMs can effectively allocate computational tasks among multiple agents, considering factors such as cost, efficiency, and performance. In this work, we address key questions, including the effectiveness of LLMs as orchestrators and planners, comparing their effectiveness in task assignment and coordination. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs can achieve high validity and accuracy in resource allocation tasks. We find that the planner method outperforms the orchestrator method in handling concurrent actions, resulting in improved efficiency and better utilization of agents. Additionally, we show that providing explicit information about worker capabilities enhances the allocation strategies of planners, particularly when dealing with suboptimal workers.",
  "summary": "This paper investigates how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used to manage and optimize task allocation in multi-agent systems, similar to a project manager distributing tasks among team members.  It explores different approaches, including a centralized \"orchestrator\" LLM that directs all agents, and a \"planner\" LLM that creates a plan for agents to execute independently.\n\nKey findings for LLM-based multi-agent systems include:\n\n* **LLMs can effectively allocate tasks, with larger models performing better but at a higher cost.**\n* **A \"planner\" LLM is more efficient than a centralized \"orchestrator\" for concurrent tasks.**\n* **Providing explicit information about agent capabilities improves planning, particularly when dealing with less capable agents.**\n* **The overall system performance is heavily influenced by the individual agent capabilities and how they are combined.**  A smaller team of more capable LLMs can outperform a larger team of mixed capabilities.",
  "takeaways": "This paper offers several valuable insights for JavaScript developers working with LLM-based multi-agent systems in web applications. Here's how developers can translate the research findings into practical implementations:\n\n**1. Planner vs. Orchestrator:**\n\nThe paper demonstrates that a \"Planner\" model, which generates a plan for multiple agent executors, is more efficient than an \"Orchestrator\" that directly controls each agent's actions.  JavaScript developers can implement this using libraries like LangChain.\n\n* **Orchestrator:**  This approach would involve calling the LLM for *every single agent action*. The main application logic would reside in the JavaScript code, with the LLM just providing actions.\n```javascript\n// Simplified example using LangChain (orchestrator)\nimport { OpenAI } from \"langchain/llms/openai\";\n\nconst llm = new OpenAI({ temperature: 0 }); \nconst agents = [/* Agent objects */];\n\nasync function runSimulation() {\n  for (const agent of agents) {\n    const observation = getAgentObservation(agent);\n    const action = await llm.call(`Agent ${agent.id}: ${observation}, What action should you take?`);\n    performAction(agent, action); \n  }\n}\n```\n\n* **Planner:** The LLM is initially called to generate a high-level plan. Individual agents then use smaller, faster LLMs or even rule-based systems to execute their part of the plan. This reduces LLM calls significantly. Replanning only happens on specific events (task completion, new task arrival, etc.).\n\n```javascript\n// Simplified example using LangChain (planner)\nimport { OpenAI } from \"langchain/llms/openai\";\n\nconst plannerLlm = new OpenAI({ temperature: 0.7 }); // For more creative planning\nconst executorLlms = [/* Smaller, faster LLMs or even rule-based systems for each agent*/];\n\n\nasync function generatePlan(game_state) {\n  const plan = await plannerLlm.call(`Given this game state: ${game_state}. Generate a plan for all agents.`);\n  return parsePlan(plan); // Parse the plan into individual agent instructions\n}\n\n\nasync function runSimulation() {\n  let plan = await generatePlan(initialGameState);\n  \n  while (gameNotOver) {\n    for (const agent of agents) {\n       const agentInstruction = plan[agent.id];\n       const action = await executorLlms[agent.id].call(agentInstruction);\n       const new_state = performAction(agent, action);\n       if (isReplanningEvent(new_state)) {\n         plan = await generatePlan(new_state);\n       }\n     }\n\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**2. Agent Capabilities and Task Allocation:**\n\nThe paper highlights the importance of considering agent capabilities when assigning tasks. This can be implemented by:\n\n* **Explicit Capability Representation:** Create profiles for each agent representing their strengths/weaknesses.  Store these profiles as JavaScript objects.  When calling the planner LLM (like GPT-4), include these profiles in the prompt to enable effective allocation.\n\n```javascript\nconst agentCapabilities = {\n  agent1: { speed: \"high\", cookingSkill: \"low\", communication: \"high\" },\n  agent2: { speed: \"low\", cookingSkill: \"high\", communication: \"low\" }\n};\n\nconst prompt = `Allocate tasks to agents considering their capabilities: ${JSON.stringify(agentCapabilities)}. ...`; \n```\n\n* **Dynamic Capability Estimation (Advanced):** Implement a system to estimate agent capabilities based on past performance.  This involves logging agent actions and outcomes and using this data to update the capability profiles. Libraries like TensorFlow.js can be used for more sophisticated performance prediction models within the browser.\n\n**3. Web Development Scenarios:**\n\n* **Collaborative document editing:**  Multiple agents can work together to edit a document (like Google Docs), each specializing in different tasks (grammar, style, fact-checking). The planner LLM would define the editing plan, and agent executors would use smaller LLMs to make specific changes.\n\n* **Automated customer service:** A group of LLM agents can handle customer inquiries, with agents specialized in different product categories. The planner LLM would route queries to the appropriate agents.\n\n* **Real-time game AI:**  Multi-agent systems can power complex game AI, with each agent controlling a character or unit.  The planner would define the overall strategy, and executors would handle individual actions.\n\n**4. Relevant JavaScript Libraries/Frameworks:**\n\n* **LangChain.js:**  Simplifies interaction with LLMs, managing prompts and responses effectively.\n* **TensorFlow.js:**  Useful for building more advanced models for dynamic capability estimation.\n* **Any frontend framework (React, Vue, Angular):**  Can be used to build the user interface for visualizing the multi-agent system's behavior.\n\n\nBy following these examples and utilizing suitable libraries, JavaScript developers can implement sophisticated LLM-based multi-agent systems, optimizing task allocation and improving the efficiency and performance of their web applications. This brings the theoretical advancements in multi-agent AI directly to the web development domain.",

It checks if the agent is capable of executing the subtask, and if so, it returns the quality of the outcome minus the cost of execution. Otherwise, it returns negative infinity (or a large negative number) to represent that the agent cannot do the task.\n\n2. **`assignSubtask()`:**  This determines whether a subtask should be assigned to an agent based on its utility.  It calls `calculateSubtaskUtility()` and assigns the task if the utility is above a certain threshold (here, greater than negative infinity, which means the agent *can* perform the task).\n\n3. **`hungarianAlgorithm()`:** This function is a placeholder for a proper implementation of the Hungarian algorithm. This algorithm solves the assignment problem, finding the optimal assignment of agents to tasks to minimize the total cost (or maximize the total utility). The example uses a hypothetical `hungarian-algorithm` library â€“ you would need to replace this with an actual implementation.\n\n4. **`capabilityAwareAllocation()`:** This is an illustrative (incomplete) function for Experiment 3's scenario.  It demonstrates a simplified approach to capability-aware allocation. A \"planner\" model generates a high-level plan consisting of subtasks. Then, each subtask is iteratively assigned to the \"worker\" model with the highest estimated efficiency for that subtask. This code doesn't handle more complex planning scenarios like task dependencies or re-planning. It's meant to show how capability information can be integrated into the allocation process.\n\n\nThese JavaScript snippets illustrate the core concepts of task allocation, resource optimization, and capability-aware assignment presented in the paper.  They are not fully fleshed-out applications, but they provide a starting point for JavaScript developers looking to experiment with these multi-agent AI ideas.  Real-world implementations would involve integrating with LLM APIs, designing robust planning mechanisms, and handling more complex environment interactions.",
