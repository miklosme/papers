  "title": "QA-Expand: Multi-Question Answer Generation for Enhanced Query Expansion in Information Retrieval",
  "abstract": "Query expansion is widely used in Information Retrieval (IR) to improve search outcomes by enriching queries with additional contextual information. Although recent Large Language Model (LLM) based methods generate pseudo-relevant content and expanded terms via multiple prompts, they often yield repetitive, narrow expansions that lack the diverse context needed to retrieve all relevant information. In this paper, we introduce QA-Expand, a novel and effective framework for query expansion. It first generates multiple relevant questions from the initial query and subsequently produces corresponding pseudo-answers as surrogate documents. A feedback model further rewrites and filters these answers to ensure only the most informative augmentations are incorporated. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as BEIR and TREC demonstrate that QA-Expand enhances retrieval performance by up to 13% over state-of-the-art methods, offering a robust solution for modern retrieval challenges.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces QA-Expand, a new technique for improving search results by expanding the initial search query. Instead of directly adding related terms, QA-Expand uses an LLM to generate relevant questions from the initial query and then generates \"pseudo-answers\" to those questions, treating them like extra information. A feedback loop refines these answers, keeping only the most relevant parts. Finally, these refined answers are combined with the original query to create a more comprehensive search query.\n\nKey points for LLM-based multi-agent systems:\n\n* **Multi-agent analogy:** The question generation and answer generation steps can be seen as separate agents collaborating to enrich the query's understanding.\n* **Feedback loop refinement:** The feedback mechanism acts as a coordinating agent, evaluating and refining the contributions of other agents (question/answer generators).\n* **Decentralized information gathering:** Each generated question explores a different facet of the original query, similar to how multiple agents might gather information from different sources.\n* **Emergent behavior:** The combined, refined search query represents a more nuanced understanding than any individual question or answer, an example of emergent behavior from multi-agent interaction.\n* **Potential for complex coordination:** This framework opens possibilities for more complex multi-agent coordination in web development, with agents specializing in different aspects of information processing and retrieval.",
  "takeaways": "This paper introduces QA-Expand, a method for enhancing query expansion using LLMs by generating question-answer pairs and then filtering them for relevance. Here's how JavaScript developers can apply these insights to LLM-based multi-agent web applications:\n\n**Practical Examples for JavaScript Developers:**\n\n1. **Enhanced Search in E-commerce:** Imagine building a multi-agent system for an e-commerce site. One agent handles user interaction, another manages product information, and a third specializes in search.  Using QA-Expand, the search agent can improve its results:\n\n    ```javascript\n    // User query: \"red running shoes size 10\"\n\n    // Question Generation (using an LLM API like OpenAI or Cohere):\n    const questions = await llm.generateQuestions(\"red running shoes size 10\");\n    // Example questions: \n    // [\"Are there any red running shoes available in size 10?\", \"What are the best red running shoes for men in size 10?\", \"Show me red running shoes in size 10 under $100.\"]\n\n    // Answer Generation (using the LLM API):\n    const answers = await llm.generateAnswers(questions);\n\n    // Feedback and Filtering (using the LLM API - or a simpler heuristic):\n    const filteredAnswers = await llm.filterAnswers(answers, \"red running shoes size 10\");\n\n    // Expanded Query (combining original query and filtered answers):\n    const expandedQuery = `red running shoes size 10 ${filteredAnswers.join(' ')}`;\n\n    // Use expandedQuery with your search index (e.g., Elasticsearch, Algolia).\n    searchIndex.search(expandedQuery);\n    ```\n\n    This allows the search agent to understand nuances like \"best\" or specific price ranges, leading to better search results.  You could use Langchain.js for easier orchestration of LLM calls.\n\n2. **Interactive Chatbots with Deeper Understanding:** In a multi-agent chatbot application, one agent could focus on generating diverse questions related to the user's initial request, while another uses those questions to retrieve more detailed information.  This creates a more engaging and informative dialogue:\n\n    ```javascript\n    // User input: \"I want to learn about climate change.\"\n\n    // Question Generation Agent:\n    const questions = await llm.generateQuestions(\"learn about climate change\");\n    // Example questions:\n    // [\"What are the main causes of climate change?\", \"What are the effects of climate change?\", \"What can I do to help with climate change?\"]\n\n    // Information Retrieval Agent:\n    questions.forEach(async (question) => {\n      const answer = await retrieveInformation(question); // Using a knowledge base or search engine\n      displayAnswer(answer); // Display the answer in the chat interface\n    });\n    ```\n\n    Frameworks like Botpress or Rasa can be extended with this multi-agent architecture.\n\n3. **Collaborative Content Creation:** Multiple agents could collaborate on writing articles or generating creative content. One agent generates initial ideas, another asks clarifying questions using QA-Expand, and a third agent synthesizes the information into a cohesive piece.\n\n**JavaScript Libraries and Frameworks:**\n\n* **Langchain.js:** Simplifies interaction with LLM APIs and chains multiple calls together.\n* **TensorFlow.js, WebDNN:** For potential client-side processing of smaller LLMs or embeddings.\n* **Botpress, Rasa:** For building conversational AI applications that can be extended with multi-agent logic.\n* **Elasticsearch, Algolia:**  For implementing robust search functionality with expanded queries.\n\n\n**Key Takeaways for JavaScript Developers:**\n\n* QA-Expand provides a practical way to improve the quality of information retrieval and understanding in LLM-based applications.\n* The question-generation and filtering steps are crucial for capturing nuanced user intent and avoiding redundant information.\n* JavaScript developers can easily integrate this technique using existing LLM APIs and frameworks.\n* This approach has significant potential for improving search, chatbots, and other web applications that rely on LLMs.\n\n\nBy understanding and applying these concepts, JavaScript developers can build more intelligent and interactive web applications using the power of multi-agent AI and LLMs.  Experimenting with different question generation prompts, answer filtering strategies, and aggregation methods will be key to achieving optimal performance in specific web application contexts.",

It performs the following steps:\n\n1. **Multiple Question Generation:** Generates multiple relevant questions from the initial query using a question-generating LLM (`questionGenerator`).\n\n2. **Pseudo-Answer Generation:** Generates pseudo-answers (surrogate documents) for each generated question using an answer-generating LLM (`answerGenerator`).\n\n3. **Feedback-Driven Rewriting and Selection:**  Rewrites and filters the generated pseudo-answers using a feedback LLM (`feedbackFilter`). This step ensures only the most informative and relevant answers are retained.\n\nThe examples provided demonstrates how to utilize this `qaExpand` function for different retrieval methodologies: sparse, dense and reciprocal rank fusion (RRF). Note that some functions such as `combineEmbeddings` and `reciprocalRankFusion` are placeholders and will require actual code based on the specific framework/tools used.  They highlight the integration points for specific logic related to embedding combination and rank fusion.  The remaining functions highlight the core logic of applying `qaExpand` to augment queries in different retrieval contexts.",
