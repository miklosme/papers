  "title": "From Natural Language to Extensive-Form Game Representations",
  "abstract": "We introduce a framework for translating game descriptions in natural language into game-theoretic extensive-form representations, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and in-context learning. We find that a naive application of in-context learning struggles on this problem, in particular with imperfect information. To address this, we introduce GameInterpreter, a two-stage framework with specialized modules to enhance in-context learning, enabling it to divide and conquer the problem effectively. In the first stage, we tackle the challenge of imperfect information by developing a module that identifies information sets and the corresponding partial tree structure. With this information, the second stage leverages in-context learning alongside a self-debugging module to produce a complete extensive-form game tree represented using pygambit, the Python API of a recognized game-theoretic analysis tool called Gambit. Using this python representation enables the automation of tasks such as computing Nash equilibria directly from natural language descriptions. We evaluate the performance of the full framework, as well as its individual components, using various LLMs on games with different levels of strategic complexity. Our experimental results show that the framework significantly outperforms baseline approaches in generating accurate extensive-form games, with each module playing a critical role in its success.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces GameInterpreter, a framework using LLMs to translate natural language game descriptions into extensive-form game representations (EFGs) for game-theoretic analysis.  It addresses the challenge of representing imperfect information games, where players may not know all previous moves, by using a two-stage approach: first identifying information sets (groups of indistinguishable player decision nodes) and the partial tree structure, then generating the full EFG using pygambit, a Python interface for the game theory analysis tool Gambit.  A self-debugging module improves the generated code.  Experiments across various LLMs demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on games of varying complexity, showing improved performance with each module, particularly for imperfect information scenarios.  The framework enables automated analysis, such as computing Nash equilibria, directly from natural language game descriptions, showcasing the potential of LLMs for multi-agent systems development.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents GameInterpreter, a framework for translating natural language game descriptions into a format understandable by game solvers. This has direct implications for JavaScript developers working with LLMs in multi-agent web applications. Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights:\n\n**1. Building Multi-Agent Simulation Environments:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine building a browser-based simulation of a market with multiple AI-driven trading agents.  The market rules, agent behaviors, and winning conditions can be described in natural language.\n* **Application:** Use a JavaScript implementation of GameInterpreter (or a similar concept) to translate these natural language rules into an EFG representation. Libraries like `petri-net.js` could help visualize and manage the game tree, while LangChain could facilitate the interaction with LLMs for interpretation and code generation.\n* **Benefit:** This simplifies the process of creating and modifying complex simulations, as developers can focus on high-level descriptions rather than low-level implementation details.\n\n**2. Creating Dynamic Game Interfaces:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Develop a web-based game where users interact with multiple LLM-powered agents. The game's rules might evolve based on player choices or external factors.\n* **Application:** Integrate GameInterpreter-like functionality to dynamically update the game's EFG representation as the rules change.  Frameworks like React or Vue.js can manage the UI updates, and libraries like TensorFlow.js can be used if numerical computation related to the game tree or payoffs is needed.\n* **Benefit:** Enables the creation of highly dynamic and adaptive games, where rules can change in real time, creating novel and unpredictable gameplay experiences.\n\n**3. Developing Collaborative LLM Applications:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Build a web application for collaborative writing, where multiple LLM agents contribute to a single document, negotiating tone, style, and content.\n* **Application:** Represent the collaborative writing process as a game, with agents making strategic choices about their contributions. GameInterpreter can translate natural language objectives (e.g., \"maintain a formal tone\") into game rules.  Serverless functions and websockets can handle the real-time interaction between the agents.\n* **Benefit:** Allows for the development of more sophisticated collaborative tools that can handle complex interactions and negotiations between multiple LLM agents.\n\n**4. Implementing Self-Debugging for LLM Agents:**\n\n* **Scenario:** An LLM agent controls a character in a web-based interactive narrative. The agent might generate actions that violate the narrative's logic or lead to unexpected outcomes.\n* **Application:** Implement a self-debugging mechanism similar to the one described in the paper. When the agent's generated code (representing an action) causes an error, feed the error message back to the LLM, along with instructions for correcting the error.\n* **Benefit:** Increases the robustness and reliability of LLM agents in complex web environments, by allowing them to learn from their mistakes and adapt to unexpected situations.\n\n**5. Experimenting with Imperfect Information in Web Games:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Develop a web-based card game where some information is hidden from players, similar to poker.\n* **Application:** Use the insights from GameInterpreter's handling of imperfect information sets to manage and update the game state.  Represent hidden information within the EFG structure and provide only relevant information to each player's client-side JavaScript code. Libraries like Boardgame.io could be adapted to handle the EFG representation.\n* **Benefit:** Enables the creation of more strategically complex web-based games that leverage the power of LLMs while incorporating realistic elements of imperfect information.\n\n\n**Key JavaScript Technologies and Libraries:**\n\n* **LLM Interaction:** LangChain, LlamaIndex.\n* **Game State Management:** Boardgame.io, Redux, Vuex.\n* **Visualization:** `petri-net.js`, D3.js.\n* **Numerical Computation:** TensorFlow.js, NumJs.\n* **UI Frameworks:** React, Vue.js, Angular.\n* **Real-time Communication:** Websockets, Serverless functions.\n\n\nBy combining the insights from GameInterpreter with these JavaScript technologies, developers can unlock the potential of LLMs for building a new generation of interactive, intelligent, and multi-agent web applications.  The core concept of translating high-level game descriptions into a computable format opens exciting possibilities for game development, simulation, collaborative tools, and other innovative web experiences.",

The buyer chooses to trust or not trust. If they trust, the seller can honor or abuse that trust.  The code defines the game tree, players, actions, and payoffs for each outcome.\n\n* **Code Example 2 (One card poker game):** This example is more complex and includes a chance node (dealing cards), imperfect information (Bob doesn't see Alice's card), and betting. The code defines the game tree structure, including the chance node, player actions (Raise, Fold, Meet, Pass), and information sets to represent Bob's lack of knowledge about Alice's card.  It also sets the payoffs for each possible outcome.\n\n**Purpose of the Algorithms/Code:**\n\nThe primary purpose of these code examples is to demonstrate how to represent game-theoretic scenarios programmatically using a library like `pygambit` (or a JavaScript equivalent).  This allows for automated analysis of the games, such as finding Nash equilibria, which is a core concept in game theory.  By translating natural language game descriptions into this code, LLMs can bridge the gap between human-readable game descriptions and computational analysis.",
