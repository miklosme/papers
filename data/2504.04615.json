  "title": "Conformal Data-driven Control of Stochastic Multi-Agent Systems under Collaborative Signal Temporal Logic Specifications",
  "abstract": "Abstract-We study the control of stochastic discrete-time linear multi-agent systems (MAS) subject to additive stochastic noise and collaborative signal temporal logic (STL) specifications to be satisfied with a desired probability. Given available disturbance datasets, we leverage conformal prediction (CP) to address the underlying chance-constrained multi-agent STL synthesis problem in a distribution-free manner. By introducing nonconformity scores as functions of prediction regions (PRs) of error trajectories, we develop an iterative PR-scaling and disturbance-feedback synthesis approach to bound training error trajectory samples. These bounds are then calibrated using a separate dataset, providing probabilistic guarantees via CP. Subsequently, we relax the underlying stochastic optimal control problem by tightening the robustness functions of collaborative tasks based on their Lipschitz constants and the computed error bounds. To address scalability, we exploit the compositional structure of the multi-agent STL formula and propose a model-predictive-control-like algorithm, where agent-level problems are solved in a distributed fashion. Lastly, we showcase the benefits of the proposed method in comparison with [1] via an illustrative example.",
  "summary": "This paper proposes a new method for controlling a group of AI agents (multi-agent system) in uncertain environments, ensuring they achieve collaborative goals expressed in formal logic (Signal Temporal Logic or STL).  It utilizes a data-driven approach called Conformal Prediction (CP) to handle uncertainties without needing to know their exact distribution.  This is done by learning \"prediction regions\" for possible errors in the agents' actions based on historical data, and then adjusting the agents' plans to stay within these safe regions.\n\nRelevant to LLM-based multi-agent systems, CP offers a distribution-free way to manage uncertainty stemming from the stochastic nature of LLMs. The proposed distributed control synthesis approach allows agents to coordinate locally within subgroups (cliques), which could improve scalability in complex LLM-based multi-agent applications.  This allows for tighter control of LLM behavior within a multi-agent setting, even when the exact probabilities of LLM outputs are unknown.",
  "takeaways": "This research paper presents a complex control synthesis method for stochastic multi-agent systems under STL specifications, which, while theoretically sound, requires significant adaptation for practical LLM-based multi-agent applications in web development. Here's how a JavaScript developer can glean practical insights and apply simplified versions of these concepts:\n\n**1. Uncertainty Management with LLMs:**\n\n* **Simplified Conformal Prediction:** While full conformal prediction as described in the paper is complex, the core idea of estimating prediction regions for LLM outputs is crucial.  Instead of strict mathematical bounds, developers can utilize simpler heuristics and calibration datasets to assess the confidence of LLM-generated actions or predictions. For example, log probabilities from LLMs can serve as a proxy for nonconformity scores. This allows for filtering or modifying LLM actions based on confidence levels.\n* **Example:** In a multi-agent chat application, an LLM generates responses for each agent. Using a calibration dataset of past conversations, you can establish confidence thresholds.  If the LLM's confidence in a generated response is below the threshold, the system could either ask for clarification, generate alternative responses, or defer to a rule-based system.  This can be implemented using libraries like TensorFlow.js for probability calculations.\n\n**2. Distributed Agent Coordination:**\n\n* **Message Passing & Coordination Logic:**  The paper’s concept of distributed control through message passing translates well to web applications.  JavaScript frameworks like Node.js and libraries like Socket.IO provide the tools to implement communication between agents.  The complex optimization in the paper can be replaced with simpler coordination logic.\n* **Example:** Consider a collaborative writing application with multiple LLM-powered agents.  Each agent could be responsible for a specific part of the document.  They can communicate their progress and proposed changes to other agents via message passing.  Simple coordination rules could be used to resolve conflicts, ensure consistency, and maintain overall document structure.\n\n**3. Task Decomposition and Robustness:**\n\n* **Simplified STL Analogs:** Full STL specification is likely too formal for most web applications.  However, the principle of decomposing complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks and ensuring robustness remains relevant.  Developers can define higher-level \"robustness\" metrics specific to their application and use them to guide agent actions.\n* **Example:** In an e-commerce platform with multiple LLM-powered agents (e.g., recommendation agent, pricing agent, customer service agent), each agent's task can be broken down.  A \"robustness\" metric for the recommendation agent could be click-through rate.  The agents can monitor their individual robustness metrics and adjust their actions (e.g., recommending different products) if they fall below a desired threshold.\n\n**4. Iterative Design and Experimentation:**\n\n* **Simulation and Feedback Loops:**  The paper’s iterative approach to control design is vital. In web development, this translates to rigorous testing and experimentation.  Simulate the multi-agent system with mock LLMs or simplified versions of the actual LLMs.  Use the results to refine agent behavior, coordination logic, and robustness metrics.\n* **Example:**  Before deploying a complex LLM-based multi-agent system, create a simplified simulation environment using JavaScript and a headless browser.  Run numerous simulations to test different scenarios and identify potential issues.  This will allow you to refine the system before deployment, reducing the risk of unexpected behavior.\n\n\n**Key JavaScript Tools and Libraries:**\n\n* **TensorFlow.js:** For probability calculations, handling LLM output probabilities, and implementing simpler versions of conformal prediction.\n* **Node.js & Socket.IO:**  For building the backend infrastructure and implementing agent communication.\n* **React, Vue, or Angular:** For building the front-end interface and visualizing the multi-agent system.\n* **LangChain:** For facilitating LLM interactions, managing prompts, and handling chain-of-thought prompting.\n\n\nIt is important to note that applying the full mathematical rigor of the paper directly to web development is challenging. However, by adapting and simplifying the core concepts, JavaScript developers can build more robust and efficient LLM-based multi-agent systems for web applications.  Focus on the practical takeaways – uncertainty management, distributed coordination, robust task decomposition, and iterative design – and use appropriate JavaScript tools and libraries to implement these ideas.",
  "pseudocode": "The paper includes two algorithms presented in pseudocode blocks. Here's their JavaScript conversion along with explanations:\n\n**Algorithm 1: Iterative procedure for solving (20)**\n\nThis algorithm aims to find optimal disturbance feedback gains (Γ) and scaling parameters (C) for prediction regions of error trajectories in a multi-agent system. It uses an iterative approach, optimizing C and Γ sequentially.  The problem is formulated as a Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) minimization.\n\n```javascript\nfunction solveIterativeCVaR(C_initial, Tmax, k, k1, theta) {\n  // 1: Set C⁰\n  let C = C_initial;\n\n  // 2: Iterate Tmax times\n  for (let tau = 1; tau <= Tmax; tau++) {\n    // 3: Solve P(C) (Implementation omitted - requires a convex optimization solver)\n    const Gamma = solveP_C(C, k, k1, theta);\n\n    // 4: Solve P(Γ) (Implementation omitted - requires a convex optimization solver)\n    C = solveP_Gamma(Gamma, k, k1, theta);\n  }\n\n  // 5: Return C* and Γ*\n  return { C: C, Gamma: Gamma };\n}\n\n// Helper functions (placeholders – require convex optimization solver integration)\nfunction solveP_C(C, k, k1, theta) { /* ...

Each agent iteratively computes its control input based on local information and communication with its neighbors in the interaction graph.\n\n```javascript\n\nfunction distributedSTLControl(agent_i, N, agents) {\n  let v = /* ... initial input sequence for agent i ... */;\n  let z = /* ... initial nominal trajectory ... */;\n  for (let t = 1; t <= N; t++) {\n    // 1: Compute r (robustness)\n    let r = Infinity;\n    for (const clique of agent_i.cliques) {\n      r = Math.min(r, robustness(clique, z)); \n    }\n    \n\n    // 2: Measure state & disturbance (Assuming these are accessible through agent_i)\n    const x_i_t = agent_i.getState(t);\n    const w_i_t_minus_1 = agent_i.getDisturbance(t-1);\n\n    // 3: Construct z\n    const z_new = constructTrajectory(x_i_t, v); // See (35)\n\n    // 4-6: Communication (Implementation varies based on communication framework)\n    const neighborInfo = communicateWithNeighbors(agent_i, r, z_new, agents);\n\n\n    // 7-11: Conditional solve and apply control\n    let shouldSolve = true;\n    for (const j of agent_i.clique) {\n      if (r > neighborInfo.get(j).robustness){\n        shouldSolve = false;\n        break;\n      }\n    }\n    if (shouldSolve) {\n      const solution = solveP_t(agent_i, t, x_i_t, neighborInfo); // Implementation omitted – requires STL solver integration\n      v = solution.v;\n      z = solution.z;\n    } else{\n      z = constructTrajectory(x_i_t, v);\n    }\n    \n\n    // Apply control input (Assuming a method to apply control to the agent)\n    const u_i_t = calculateControlInput(agent_i, v, w_i_t_minus_1);\n    agent_i.applyControl(u_i_t) ;\n\n\n  }\n}\n\n//Helper Functions (Placeholders)\n\nfunction robustness(clique, z) { /* ... calculate robustness based on z ... */ return /* ... robustness value ... */ }\nfunction constructTrajectory(x_i_t,v){ /* ... construct based on (35)...*/ return /* trajectory object */ }\nfunction communicateWithNeighbors(agent_i, r, z_new, agents) { /* ... implement communication logic ... */ return /* ... map of neighbor information ... */ }\nfunction solveP_t(agent_i, t, x_i_t, neighborInfo) { /* ... solve agent-level problem Pt ... */ return /* ... solution containing v and z ... */ }\nfunction calculateControlInput(agent_i, v, w_i_t_minus_1) {/* calculate control input based on equation (12) */ return /* control input value */ }\n\n\n```\n\n\nThese JavaScript implementations provide a starting point for implementing the algorithms presented in the paper. Note that integration with specific convex optimization and STL solvers is necessary to complete the code.  The communication aspects in Algorithm 2 also require adaptation to the chosen communication framework in the multi-agent system.",
