  "title": "Aligning Compound AI Systems via System-level DPO",
  "abstract": "Compound AI systems, comprising multiple interacting components such as LLM agents and external tools, demonstrate state-of-the-art results across diverse tasks. It is hence crucial to align components within the system to produce consistent results that match human expectations. However, conventional alignment methods, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), are not directly applicable to compound AI systems. These challenges include the non-differentiable interactions between components, making end-to-end gradient optimization infeasible. Additionally, system-level preferences cannot be directly translated into component-level preferences, further complicating alignment. We address the issues by formulating compound AI systems as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), capturing the connections between agents and the data generation processes. We propose a system-level DPO (SysDPO) to jointly align compound systems by adapting the DPO to operate on these DAGs. We study the joint alignment of an LLM and a diffusion model to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our exploration provides insights into the alignment of compound AI systems and lays a foundation for future advancements.",
  "summary": "This paper proposes a new method called System-level Direct Preference Optimization (SysDPO) to better align the output of multi-agent AI systems with human preferences.  It addresses the challenge of aligning systems where components (like LLMs and image generators) interact in non-differentiable ways, making standard alignment techniques like DPO difficult to apply directly.\n\nSysDPO models the multi-agent system as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) representing the flow of information between components. This allows the system's output probability to be broken down and optimized with a modified DPO loss function, enabling end-to-end training and better alignment of all components with system-level preferences.  The researchers demonstrate SysDPO's effectiveness by aligning an LLM and a diffusion model for a multi-image generation task, showing improved coherence and adherence to user instructions.  The key takeaway for LLM-based multi-agent systems is that SysDPO offers a way to directly optimize for desired system behavior even when component interactions are non-differentiable.",
  "takeaways": "This paper introduces SysDPO, a method for aligning multiple AI agents within a compound system, ensuring they work together effectively towards a shared goal based on user preferences. Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights to LLM-based multi-agent web applications:\n\n**1. Representing the Multi-Agent System as a DAG:**\n\n* **Conceptualization:**  Visualize your application's agents (LLMs, other models, and tools) and their interactions as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).  For example, an agent specializing in summarizing text feeds into another agent responsible for generating tweets.\n* **Implementation in JavaScript:**  Represent this DAG using JavaScript objects. Each node can be an object representing an agent, containing its functionality (e.g., calling an LLM API) and connections to other agents.\n    ```javascript\n    const summarizerAgent = {\n      name: \"summarizer\",\n      function: async (text) => { /* LLM API call for summarization */ },\n      output: null,\n      next: tweetGeneratorAgent\n    };\n\n    const tweetGeneratorAgent = {\n      name: \"tweetGenerator\",\n      function: async (summary) => { /* LLM API call for tweet generation */ },\n      input: summarizerAgent,\n      output: null\n    };\n    ```\n* **Libraries:** Libraries like `dagre-d3` or `vis-network` can be used for visualizing and managing the DAG in a web interface.\n\n**2. Implementing SysDPO in JavaScript:**\n\n* **Preference Collection:** Create a user interface (using React, Vue, or similar) to collect user preferences on the output of the multi-agent system. Present different outputs generated by the system for a given input and let users choose their preferred one.\n* **SysDPO Loss Function:** Translate the SysDPO loss function (equation 2 and 4 in the paper) into JavaScript. This function will calculate the difference between the system's output and the user's preferred output. Libraries like `TensorFlow.js` or `math.js` can be helpful for numerical computations.\n* **Optimization:** Use a JavaScript optimization library (e.g., a simple gradient descent implementation or more advanced optimizers from `ml5.js`) to minimize the SysDPO loss.  This will adjust the parameters of your agents (e.g., prompts, temperature settings for LLMs) to better align with user preferences.\n* **Example (Simplified):**\n    ```javascript\n    async function optimizeAgents(agentDAG, preferenceData) {\n      // ... (Implementation of SysDPO loss function using preferenceData and agentDAG)\n\n      let loss = calculateSysDPOloss(agentDAG, preferenceData);\n\n      // ... (Implementation of gradient descent or other optimization algorithm)\n      while (loss > threshold) {\n          // ... (Update agent parameters based on gradients)\n          loss = calculateSysDPOloss(agentDAG, preferenceData);\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n**3. Web Development Scenarios:**\n\n* **Content Creation:** Imagine a multi-agent system where one agent generates article outlines, another writes content sections based on the outline, and a third optimizes for SEO. SysDPO can be used to align these agents to produce content that matches user preferences for style, tone, and SEO effectiveness.\n* **Chatbots:** In a multi-agent chatbot, one agent might handle user queries, another might access external databases, and a third might generate personalized responses. SysDPO can ensure consistent and helpful responses aligned with user expectations.\n* **E-commerce:**  One agent might recommend products based on user browsing history, another might generate product descriptions, and a third might personalize pricing offers. SysDPO can optimize the system for increased sales and customer satisfaction based on user preferences.\n\n\n**4. Key Considerations for JavaScript Developers:**\n\n* **Asynchronous Operations:** Multi-agent systems often involve asynchronous operations. Use Promises and async/await in JavaScript to manage the flow of data between agents efficiently.\n* **Scalability:** For complex systems, consider using a distributed task queue (e.g., Bull, Redis) to manage the execution of agent functions and data flow.\n* **Debugging and Monitoring:** Implement robust logging and monitoring to track agent performance, identify bottlenecks, and debug issues.\n\nBy applying these principles and using the right JavaScript tools and frameworks, developers can leverage the insights of the SysDPO paper to build more user-centric and effective LLM-based multi-agent web applications.  Remember that this is a simplified overview, and further research and experimentation are essential for successful implementation.",
  "pseudocode": "The paper doesn't contain explicit pseudocode blocks defining algorithms. However, the core contribution, the SysDPO algorithm, is described mathematically through equations.  Here's a conceptual JavaScript representation of the key components, focusing on the LLM + Diffusion model example:\n\n```javascript\n// Conceptual representation of SysDPO for LLM + Diffusion Model\n\nasync function sysDPO(llm, diffusionModel, dataset, beta, referenceModels) {\n\n  // Iterate over the dataset of preference pairs (x, sw, sl)\n  for (const {x, sw, sl} of dataset) {\n\n      // LLM generates captions (intermediate outputs)\n      const yw = await llm.generateCaptions(x);\n      const yl = await llm.generateCaptions(x);\n\n\n      let loss = 0;\n\n      // Calculate loss for LLM component \n      const llmLoss = -Math.log(sigmoid(beta * (\n          Math.log(llm.likelihood(yw, x)) -  Math.log(llm.likelihood(yl, x))\n      )));\n\n      loss+= llmLoss\n\n      //Calculate loss for Diffusion Model component, iterating over generated captions\n      for (let i = 0; i < yw.length; i++) {\n\n          //  Diffusion model generates images based on captions \n          const zw = await diffusionModel.generateImages(yw[i]);\n          const zl = await diffusionModel.generateImages(yl[i]);\n\n\n          // Calculate loss for diffusion model using denoiser approach (see paper for details)\n          const diffusionLoss = calculateDiffusionLoss(diffusionModel, zw, zl, yw[i], yl[i]);\n          loss += diffusionLoss;\n\n      }\n\n      // Update model parameters based on the calculated loss using gradient descent or similar optimization method\n      updateModelParameters(llm, diffusionModel, loss);\n\n    }\n}\n\nfunction sigmoid(z) {\n    return 1 / (1 + Math.exp(-z));\n}\n\n// Placeholder for calculating diffusion model loss using denoising approach (details in paper's Appendix A)\nasync function calculateDiffusionLoss(diffusionModel, zw, zl, yw, yl) {\n\n    let denoiseLoss = 0\n    // simplified logic \n    // In reality this involves iterating through timesteps in diffusion process\n    // and calculating denoiser loss at each step\n    denoiseLoss +=  diffusionModel.denoiseLoss(zw, yw) - diffusionModel.denoiseLoss(zl, yl)\n    return denoiseLoss\n}\n\n\n\n// Placeholder for model parameter updates (using an optimizer like Adam)\nfunction updateModelParameters(llm, diffusionModel, loss) {\n // Update parameters here...\n}\n\n```\n\n**Explanation and Purpose:**\n\nThe SysDPO algorithm aims to align components of a compound AI system (like an LLM paired with a Diffusion model) based on user preferences. It uses a dataset where each entry consists of an input prompt (`x`) and two sets of system outputs (`sw` - preferred, `sl` - not preferred).\n\n1. **System Representation:** The system is structured as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). In the LLM+Diffusion model case, the LLM generates captions, and the diffusion model generates images based on those captions.\n\n2. **Probability Factorization:** The likelihood of generating the outputs is decomposed based on the DAG.  This allows handling non-differentiable interactions between components.\n\n3. **Preference Dataset:** The dataset of preferred and not-preferred outputs drives the learning process.\n\n4. **Loss Function:** The core of SysDPO is its loss function (equation 4 in the paper and conceptually implemented in the Javascript). It incorporates the likelihoods from individual components (LLM and Diffusion Model).  Crucially, the Diffusion Model's likelihood is approximated using a denoiser approach (details in Appendix A of the paper).\n\n5. **Optimization:** The algorithm uses gradient descent (or a similar optimization method) to minimize the loss function, updating the parameters of both the LLM and Diffusion Model simultaneously. This ensures that the components learn to work together to produce outputs aligned with human preferences.\n\n\nThis JavaScript code provides a high-level structural understanding of SysDPO.  The paper's mathematical descriptions, particularly concerning the denoiser approach for diffusion models and the optimization process, would need more detailed implementation using a specific deep learning library (e.g., TensorFlow.js, PyTorch).",
