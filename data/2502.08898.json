  "title": "Learning in Strategic Queuing Systems with Small Buffers",
  "abstract": "Routers in networking use simple learning algorithms to find the best way to deliver packets to their desired destination. This simple, myopic and distributed decision system makes large queuing systems simple to operate, but at the same time, the system needs more capacity than would be required if all traffic were centrally coordinated. In a recent paper, Gaitonde and Tardos (EC 2020 and JACM 2023) initiate the study of such systems, modeling them as an infinitely repeated game in which routers compete for servers and the system maintains a state (number of packets held by each queue) that results from outcomes of previous rounds. Queues get to send a packet at each step to one of the servers, and servers attempt to process only one of the arriving packets, modeling routers. However, their model assumes that servers have no buffers at all, so queues have to resend all packets that were not served successfully. They show that, even with hugely increased server capacity relative to what is needed in the centrally-coordinated case, ensuring that the system is stable requires the use of timestamps and priority for older packets. We consider a system with two important changes, which make the model more realistic: first we add a very small buffer to each server, allowing the server to hold on to a single packet to be served later (even if it fails to serve it); and second, we do not require timestamps or priority for older packets. Our main result is to show that when queues are learning, a small constant factor increase in server capacity, compared to what would be needed if centrally coordinating, suffices to keep the system stable, even if servers select randomly among packets arriving simultaneously. This work contributes to the growing literature on the impact of selfish learning in systems with carryover effects between rounds: when outcomes in the present round affect the game in the future.",
  "summary": "This paper studies how simple learning algorithms used by routers (agents) in a network can efficiently distribute packets (tasks) to servers (resources) with limited buffer capacity.  The key finding is that even with small buffers at each server, a small constant factor increase in total server capacity, compared to a perfectly coordinated system, is enough to keep the system stable when routers use learning algorithms. This is relevant to LLM-based multi-agent systems as it demonstrates that decentralized, learning-based agents can effectively manage shared resources even with limitations like buffering constraints, hinting at robust and scalable multi-agent coordination possibilities in web applications.",
  "takeaways": "This paper's insights on stable learning in queuing systems with small buffers offer valuable lessons for JavaScript developers building LLM-based multi-agent web applications.  Here are some practical examples and considerations:\n\n**1. Managing LLM API Calls (Rate Limiting and Retries):**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine a web app where multiple agents (e.g., chatbots, automated content creators) rely on an LLM API.  Each agent needs to send requests to the API (like submitting prompts and receiving generated text). This is analogous to the queues and servers model in the paper.  LLM APIs often have rate limits (like the server capacity, *Î¼*).\n* **Application of Insights:** The paper shows that even small buffers (the ability for the server to hold a single request) can significantly improve stability and throughput. In your JavaScript code, you can implement a queuing mechanism with retry logic.  If an agent's request is initially rejected due to rate limiting, it gets placed in a short queue for automatic retry.  Libraries like `async.queue` or custom Promise-based queues can help achieve this.\n* **Benefits:** Prevents overwhelming the LLM API, gracefully handles bursts of requests, improves overall agent responsiveness, and avoids unnecessary request failures.\n\n**2. Decentralized Agent Coordination (Resource Allocation):**\n\n* **Scenario:**  A web app with multiple LLM-powered agents collaborating on a task (e.g., generating different parts of a report, brainstorming ideas).  These agents need access to shared resources (database, file storage, other APIs) which can be seen as the servers.\n* **Application of Insights:** The no-regret learning approach from the paper can be applied here.  Each agent can use a simple algorithm (e.g., EXP3) to learn which resource to utilize at any given time, minimizing its individual regret (i.e., minimizing the difference between its performance and the performance of the best resource choice).\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**  Maintain a small history of each agent's interactions with the resources (successes, failures, latency). Use this history to update the agent's probability distribution over resources using the EXP3 algorithm.  This can be implemented directly in JavaScript or using a library for multi-armed bandit algorithms.\n* **Benefits:** Improves resource utilization, reduces contention, and enables decentralized coordination without the need for a central manager.\n\n**3. Front-End Optimization (Loading and Rendering):**\n\n* **Scenario:**  A complex web app has many components that need to load content (images, text, videos) from different sources.  These components act like queues requesting resources from servers (content delivery networks or APIs).\n* **Application of Insights:** Implement a priority queue for loading critical components first. This is inspired by the paper's mention of timestamps and priority for older packets.  Components vital for initial rendering get higher priority, minimizing user perceived latency. Libraries like `priorityqueue.js` could be helpful.\n* **Benefits:**  Improved user experience by prioritizing critical content, faster loading times, and more efficient handling of limited network resources.\n\n\n**4. Experimentation with JavaScript:**\n\nThe paper encourages experimentation. Here are some ways JavaScript developers can explore these concepts:\n\n* **Simulations:** Build simple simulations of multi-agent systems using Node.js and libraries like `async` or `p-queue`.  Simulate different arrival rates, server capacities, buffer sizes, and learning algorithms.\n* **Browser-Based Experiments:**  Use client-side JavaScript to create browser-based experiments where agents compete for resources (e.g., access to a shared WebSocket).  Visualize agent behavior and system performance using libraries like `Chart.js` or `D3.js`.\n* **Integration with LLM Frameworks:**  Integrate these concepts into existing LLM-based JavaScript frameworks like `LangChainJS`.  Experiment with different queuing and retry strategies for managing LLM API calls within a LangChainJS workflow.\n\n\n**Key JavaScript Libraries/Frameworks:**\n\n* `async.queue`:  For managing asynchronous tasks and queues.\n* `p-queue`:  For priority queues.\n* `priorityqueue.js`:  Another priority queue implementation.\n* `LangChainJS`: For building applications with LLMs.\n* `Chart.js`, `D3.js`: For visualizing results.\n* Libraries for multi-armed bandit algorithms.\n\n\nBy understanding the principles of stable learning in queuing systems, JavaScript developers can create more robust and efficient LLM-based multi-agent web applications that effectively manage resources and handle the complexities of real-world scenarios.",
  "pseudocode": "No pseudocode block found. However, the paper references the EXP3.P.1 algorithm (Auer et al., 2002a) as a suitable learning algorithm for the queues.  While the paper doesn't provide pseudocode, we can create a JavaScript implementation based on its description. This algorithm is a variant of the EXP3 algorithm designed to handle probabilistic feedback, as is the case with the queuing system described in the paper.\n\n```javascript\nclass EXP3P1 {\n  constructor(numActions, gamma, eta) {\n    this.numActions = numActions;\n    this.gamma = gamma; // Exploration parameter\n    this.eta = eta;      // Learning rate\n    this.weights = Array(this.numActions).fill(1);\n    this.probabilities = Array(this.numActions).fill(1/this.numActions); // Initialize uniformly\n  }\n\n  chooseAction() {\n     // Softmax to get action probabilities. Note: there are more numerically stable ways to do this.\n     let sumWeights = 0;\n     for(let i=0; i < this.weights.length; i++){\n        sumWeights += this.weights[i];\n     }\n\n     for(let i=0; i < this.weights.length; i++){\n        this.probabilities[i] = (1-this.gamma) * (this.weights[i] / sumWeights) + (this.gamma / this.numActions);\n     }\n\n\n     // Sample action based on probabilities.\n    let randomValue = Math.random();\n    let cumulativeProbability = 0;\n    for (let i = 0; i < this.numActions; i++) {\n      cumulativeProbability += this.probabilities[i];\n      if (randomValue < cumulativeProbability) {\n        return i;\n      }\n    }\n    return this.numActions -1; // Should not happen, but prevents errors\n  }\n\n  update(chosenAction, reward) {\n\n    let estimatedReward = (reward / this.probabilities[chosenAction]);\n\n\n    this.weights[chosenAction] *= Math.exp(this.eta * estimatedReward);\n\n    \n  }\n}\n\n\n\n// Example usage:\n\nconst numServers = 5; // Number of servers (actions)\nconst learningRate = 0.1;\nconst explorationRate = 0.05;\n\nconst exp3p1 = new EXP3P1(numServers, explorationRate, learningRate);\n\n\nfor (let t = 0; t < 1000; t++) {  // Example time horizon\n  const chosenServer = exp3p1.chooseAction();\n\n  // Simulate sending a packet to the server\n  // and receiving a reward (1 for success, 0 for failure)\n  let reward = 0;\n  // Example where each server has different probability of success, from the paper\n  if(chosenServer == 0){\n    reward = (Math.random() < 0.8 ? 1: 0); // Server 0 success rate of 0.8\n  } else if(chosenServer == 1 || chosenServer == 2){\n    reward = (Math.random() < 0.4 ? 1: 0); // Server 1,2 success rate of 0.4\n  } else {\n     reward = (Math.random() < 0.2 ? 1: 0); // Server 3,4 success rate of 0.2\n  }\n\n\n\n\n  exp3p1.update(chosenServer, reward);\n  //Log probabilities over time for demonstration.\n  if(t % 100 == 0){\n    console.log(`Probabilities at t=${t}:`, exp3p1.probabilities);\n  }\n}\n\n\n```\n\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`EXP3P1(numActions, gamma, eta)`:**  Initializes the algorithm with the number of possible actions (servers), an exploration parameter (`gamma`), and a learning rate (`eta`). The weights for each action are initialized to 1, representing an initial uniform distribution over the actions.\n* **`chooseAction()`:**  Selects an action (server) based on a probability distribution derived from the current weights.  It adds exploration by ensuring each action has at least a `gamma / numActions` probability of being chosen. \n* **`update(chosenAction, reward)`:** Updates the weight of the chosen action based on the received `reward`. The reward is scaled by `1/probability` to account for the probabilistic nature of the reward, a key aspect of EXP3.P.1.  Higher rewards lead to higher weights, making the action more likely to be chosen in the future.\n\n**Purpose:**\n\nThe EXP3.P.1 algorithm helps each queue learn which servers are most likely to accept its packets over time, even when the feedback is probabilistic.  This allows the queues to adapt their server selection strategy to improve their throughput. The algorithm's no-regret property, as highlighted in the paper, provides theoretical guarantees regarding its performance in the long run.  It ensures that the algorithm's cumulative reward wouldn't be much worse than consistently choosing the best server in hindsight. This no-regret property is crucial for ensuring the stability of the queuing system when queues use this learning algorithm.",
