  "title": "InfoBid: A Simulation Framework for Studying Information Disclosure in Auctions with Large Language Model-based Agents",
  "abstract": "In online advertising systems, publishers often face a trade-off in information disclosure strategies: while disclosing more information can enhance efficiency by enabling optimal allocation of ad impressions, it may lose revenue potential by decreasing uncertainty among competing advertisers. Similar to other challenges in market design, understanding this trade-off is constrained by limited access to real-world data, leading researchers and practitioners to turn to simulation frameworks. The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs) offers a novel approach to simulations, providing human-like reasoning and adaptability without necessarily relying on explicit assumptions about agent behavior modeling. Despite their potential, existing frameworks have yet to integrate LLM-based agents for studying information asymmetry and signaling strategies, particularly in the context of auctions. To address this gap, we introduce InfoBid, a flexible simulation framework that leverages LLM agents to examine the effects of information disclosure strategies in multi-agent auction settings. Using GPT-40, we implemented simulations of second-price auctions with diverse information schemas. The results reveal key insights into how signaling influences strategic behavior and auction outcomes, which align with both economic and social learning theories. Through InfoBid, we hope to foster the use of LLMs as proxies for human economic and social agents in empirical studies, enhancing our understanding of their capabilities and limitations. This work bridges the gap between theoretical market designs and practical applications, advancing research in market simulations, information design, and agent-based reasoning while offering a valuable tool for exploring the dynamics of digital economies.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces InfoBid, a simulation framework using Large Language Models (LLMs) as agents to study how revealing different amounts of information affects online advertising auctions.  It explores how LLM-based agents make decisions when they don't know everyone's value for the advertised item.  Key findings relevant to LLM-based multi-agent systems include: LLM agents generally bid rationally when given clear information but deviate when given partial information about their standing relative to other bidders; agents appear not to explicitly consider their competitors' strategies, aligning with theoretical predictions for this type of auction; providing more information to high-value bidders generally leads to both higher revenue and better overall outcomes.  This suggests that carefully controlling information flow in such systems is crucial for good results.",
  "takeaways": "This paper's insights on information disclosure in multi-agent auctions using LLMs can be directly applied to several web development scenarios. Here are some practical examples for JavaScript developers:\n\n**1. Building Interactive Narrative Experiences:** Imagine developing a choose-your-own-adventure game where the story unfolds based on interactions with LLM-powered NPCs.  The InfoBid framework's concept of tiered information disclosure translates to revealing information about the NPCs' motivations or backstory incrementally.\n\n* **Implementation:** Use a framework like React or Vue.js to manage the game's UI and state.  Integrate with an LLM API (e.g., OpenAI, Cohere) to generate NPC dialogue.  Based on player choices, reveal information about NPC valuations (their goals, desires) in tiers – basic, intermediate, and advanced. This tiered disclosure can make the narrative more engaging by gradually unveiling the complexity of the characters.\n\n```javascript\n// Example (Conceptual):\nfunction revealNpcInformation(npc, tier) {\n  switch (tier) {\n    case \"basic\":\n      return llm.generateText(`Basic info about ${npc.name}'s goals`);\n    case \"intermediate\":\n      return llm.generateText(`More detailed insights into ${npc.name}'s past`);\n    case \"advanced\":\n      return llm.generateText(`Secrets and hidden motivations of ${npc.name}`);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**2. Developing Collaborative Design Tools:** Consider a web app for collaborative design where multiple users (agents) contribute to a project.  The \"Pool-High\" strategy from the paper can be applied to selectively disclose top-rated design elements or feedback.\n\n* **Implementation:** Use Node.js and Socket.IO to create real-time communication between users.  Store design elements and user feedback in a database. Implement a ranking algorithm.  Based on user roles or contribution levels, disclose information about the top-ranked designs (e.g., \"This design element is in the top 10%\"). This can encourage higher-quality contributions and focus attention on the most promising ideas.\n\n\n**3. Creating Dynamic Pricing Models:** The paper's exploration of auction mechanisms is relevant for e-commerce platforms or online marketplaces. You can experiment with dynamic pricing models based on LLM-driven agent interactions.\n\n* **Implementation:** Use a serverless function platform (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions) to handle pricing logic. Integrate with an LLM that receives information about product demand, competitor pricing, and user behavior as input. The LLM can then suggest dynamic pricing adjustments based on the information it receives, mimicking the auctioneer's role in InfoBid.\n\n**4. Building Personalized Recommendation Systems:** The paper’s principles can be applied to build recommendation systems that selectively reveal information about products.  Instead of showing all product details at once, reveal features or benefits in a tiered fashion based on user engagement.\n\n* **Implementation:** A frontend JavaScript framework can display product information, initially showing a limited set of details. Track user interactions (clicks, hover time, etc.).  Based on engagement, reveal more detailed product attributes in tiers, leveraging an LLM to generate compelling descriptions for each tier.  This can make the recommendation process more interactive and personalized.\n\n**Key Libraries and Frameworks:**\n\n* **LLM APIs:** OpenAI, Cohere, Anthropic, etc.\n* **Frontend Frameworks:** React, Vue.js, Angular, Svelte.\n* **Backend Frameworks:** Node.js, Express.js, NestJS.\n* **Real-time Communication:** Socket.IO.\n* **State Management:** Redux, MobX.\n\nBy adapting the concepts of information disclosure and LLM-based agent interaction, JavaScript developers can create innovative web applications with more engaging user experiences and intelligent behavior. Remember to focus on ethical considerations and transparency when designing these systems.  The goal is to enhance user experience and decision-making, not manipulate it.",
  "pseudocode": "```javascript\nfunction poolHigh(valuation, quantileThreshold) {\n  // Cumulative distribution function for a uniform distribution [0, 1] is F(x) = x\n  const cdf = valuation;\n\n  if (cdf < quantileThreshold) {\n    return valuation; // Full disclosure below the threshold\n  } else {\n    return \"pooled\"; // Signal as pooled above the threshold\n  }\n}\n\nfunction poolLow(valuation, quantileThreshold) {\n  const cdf = valuation;\n\n  if (cdf >= quantileThreshold) {\n    return valuation; // Full disclosure above the threshold\n  } else {\n    return \"pooled\"; // Signal as pooled below the threshold\n  }\n}\n\nfunction randomizedPool(valuation, disclosureProbability) {\n  if (Math.random() < disclosureProbability) {\n    return valuation; // Disclose with given probability\n  } else {\n    return \"pooled\"; // Pool otherwise\n  }\n}\n\n\n// Example usage (assuming valuations are between 0 and 1):\n\nconst valuation = 0.85;\nconst quantileThreshold = 0.5;\nconst disclosureProbability = 0.3;\n\n\nconst poolHighSignal = poolHigh(valuation, quantileThreshold);\nconsole.log(`Pool-High Signal: ${poolHighSignal}`);  // Output: pooled\n\nconst poolLowSignal = poolLow(valuation, quantileThreshold);\nconsole.log(`Pool-Low Signal: ${poolLowSignal}`); // Output: 0.85\n\nconst randomizedPoolSignal = randomizedPool(valuation, disclosureProbability);\nconsole.log(`Randomized Pool Signal: ${randomizedPoolSignal}`); // Output (may vary due to randomness) : pooled or 0.85\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Explanation of the Algorithms and their Purpose:**\n\nThe provided JavaScript code implements the three core signaling strategies outlined in the research paper: `Pool-High`, `Pool-Low`, and `Randomized Pooling`. These strategies dictate how information about bidders' valuations is disclosed (or concealed) in an auction setting.  The goal is to study how these different information disclosure strategies influence bidder behavior and ultimately impact the auction's outcomes (revenue, social welfare).\n\n\n1. **`poolHigh(valuation, quantileThreshold)`:**\n    - **Purpose:** Implements the \"Pool-High\" signaling strategy. This strategy aims to create more competition among high-value bidders by selectively pooling their valuations above a certain quantile threshold.\n    - **Algorithm:** Takes a bidder's valuation and a quantile threshold as input. If the valuation is below the threshold, it's fully disclosed. If the valuation is above the threshold, it is replaced with a generic \"pooled\" signal, indicating that the bidder belongs to the high-value group but concealing the precise valuation.\n\n2. **`poolLow(valuation, quantileThreshold)`:**\n    - **Purpose:** Implements the \"Pool-Low\" signaling strategy. This is the opposite of Pool-High; it pools the valuations of bidders below the quantile threshold, potentially inducing them to bid more aggressively.\n    - **Algorithm:** Similar to `poolHigh`, but disclosures valuations above the threshold, and pools those below it.\n\n\n3. **`randomizedPool(valuation, disclosureProbability)`:**\n    - **Purpose:** Implements the \"Randomized Pooling\" strategy. This strategy introduces uncertainty by randomly deciding whether to disclose a bidder's true valuation or provide the \"pooled\" signal.\n    - **Algorithm:** Takes a bidder's valuation and a disclosure probability as input. It discloses the valuation with the specified probability and provides the \"pooled\" signal otherwise.  This introduces a stochastic element into the information disclosure process.\n\n\n\nThe paper also discusses variants of the Tiered Pooling strategies (\"Tier Only\" and \"Tier and Average Value\"), but the core logic is encapsulated in these three base algorithms. The provided code focuses on the essential information disclosure mechanisms.  In a complete simulation, these functions would be integrated into the auction's signaling phase, where each bidder's valuation would be passed through the selected signaling strategy to generate the signals received by each bidder.",
