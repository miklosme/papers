  "title": "The Chronicles of Foundation AI for Forensics of Multi-Agent Provenance",
  "abstract": "Abstract-Provenance is the chronology of things, resonating with the fundamental pursuit to uncover origins, trace connections, and situate entities within the flow of space and time. As artificial intelligence advances towards autonomous agents capable of interactive collaboration on complex tasks, the provenance of generated content becomes entangled in the interplay of collective creation, where contributions are continuously revised, extended or overwritten. In a multi-agent generative chain, content undergoes successive transformations, often leaving little, if any, trace of prior contributions. In this study, we investigates the problem of tracking multi-agent provenance across the temporal dimension of generation. We propose a chronological system for post hoc attribution of generative history from content alone, without reliance on internal memory states or external meta-information. At its core lies the notion of symbolic chronicles, representing signed and time-stamped records, in a form analogous to the chain of custody in forensic science. The system operates through a feedback loop, whereby each generative timestep updates the chronicle of prior interactions and synchronises it with the synthetic content in the very act of generation. This research seeks to develop an accountable form of collaborative artificial intelligence within evolving cyber ecosystems.",
  "summary": "This paper proposes a system for tracking the contributions of individual AI agents in collaborative content creation, specifically for text generation. It uses \"chronicles,\" or timestamps of contributing agents, which are encoded directly into the generated text through subtle lexical biases.  This eliminates the need for external metadata and allows provenance to be recovered directly from the final text output.  Key points for LLM-based multi-agent systems include the scalable creation of codebooks for managing lexical biases, the feedback loop for updating and encoding chronicles during generation, and the decoding process for reconstructing the order of agent contributions.  Experiments demonstrate the tradeoff between accurate provenance tracking (achieved through stronger bias) and the quality of generated text (which decreases with stronger bias).",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents a fascinating approach to tracking provenance in multi-agent LLM applications, particularly relevant for collaborative content creation scenarios. Here are some practical examples for JavaScript developers:\n\n**1. Collaborative Writing Application (e.g., Google Docs with AI Agents):**\n\n* **Scenario:** Multiple users and AI agents collaborate on a document, each making edits and additions. The goal is to track individual contributions, even if overwritten or revised.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * **Client-side (Browser):**  Use a JavaScript library like TensorFlow.js or a dedicated LLM API client to interact with the LLM. Integrate the \"chronicle\" concept by modifying the LLM's token probabilities based on the active agent (user or AI). This could involve custom prompt engineering or direct manipulation of logits if the API allows it.\n    * **Server-side (Node.js):** Manage the codebook and chronicle updates.  When an agent makes an edit, the server updates the chronicle, encodes it into the text via the biased sampling mechanism described in the paper, and broadcasts the updated text. The codebook itself could be stored efficiently using a key-value database like Redis.\n    * **Decoding:** On the client-side, use TensorFlow.js to analyze received text segments, comparing lexical choices against the codebook to decode the chronicle and reconstruct contribution history. Display this information in a user-friendly way (e.g., color-coded text segments).\n* **Frameworks:** React, Vue, or Angular for the frontend UI, Node.js with Express or similar for the backend server.\n\n**2. Multi-Agent Game Development:**\n\n* **Scenario:** An online game where multiple AI agents controlled by different LLMs interact, impacting the game's narrative and environment.  Tracking which agent influenced which part of the story is crucial.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * **Server-side (Node.js):** Store the game state and chronicles. Each agent's action is associated with a chronicle update.  Encode the chronicle into the game state description (text-based adventures) or subtly influence the game environment (e.g., procedural generation biased by the chronicle).\n    * **Client-side (Browser):**  Decode the chronicle from received game updates to understand the AI agents' influence on the game narrative.  Visualize this information for the player (e.g., a provenance graph).\n* **Frameworks:** Phaser, Babylon.js, or Three.js for game development. Node.js with Socket.IO for real-time communication.\n\n\n**3. AI-Powered Code Generation & Debugging:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Multiple specialized AI agents collaborate to generate or debug code.  Tracking which agent generated which code snippet simplifies debugging and understanding the code's evolution.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * **Code Editor Integration (e.g., VS Code Extension):** Embed the encoding/decoding logic.  As agents contribute code, update and encode the chronicle directly into the generated code, perhaps using comments or subtle coding style variations (consistent with the biased sampling).\n    * **Decoding:**  Analyze the code to decode the chronicle and visualize the contributions of each agent.  Highlight code sections generated by specific agents, making it easier to track down bugs or understand design choices.\n\n\n**Key JavaScript Considerations:**\n\n* **Efficiency:** For large codebooks and vocabularies, optimize the encoding and decoding processes.  Consider techniques like bitwise operations and efficient data structures. Web Workers could offload these computations to separate threads to prevent UI blocking.\n* **Security:**  If provenance is critical, explore ways to prevent chronicle manipulation.  Cryptographic hashing of the chronicle could be incorporated.\n* **Visualization:** D3.js or similar libraries could be used to create interactive visualizations of provenance information.\n\n**Simplified Example (Conceptual):**\n\n```javascript\n// Simplified encoding (client-side)\nfunction encodeChronicle(text, chronicle, codebook) {\n  let biasedText = \"\";\n  // ... (Logic to bias token selection based on chronicle and codebook)\n  return biasedText;\n}\n\n// Simplified decoding (client-side)\nfunction decodeChronicle(text, codebook) {\n  let chronicle = \"\";\n  // ... (Logic to analyze text and infer chronicle from codebook)\n  return chronicle;\n}\n```\n\nThis simplified example illustrates the core idea. Real-world implementations would require more sophisticated handling of LLMs, codebooks, and text processing.  The paper provides a valuable theoretical foundation that JavaScript developers can adapt and apply to build truly innovative multi-agent LLM web applications.",

Retrieves the corresponding codeword from the `codebook` based on the input `chronicle`.\n    2. Predicts logits (pre-softmax probabilities) from the language model given the prompt.\n    3. Adds a bias `biasStrength` to the logits of tokens marked with '1' in the `codeword`, making those tokens more likely to be sampled.\n    4. Applies softmax to the biased logits to get a probability distribution.\n    5. Samples a token from the probability distribution and detokenizes it.\n    6. Repeats steps 2-5 until a termination criterion is met (e.g., maximum token limit).\n* **Key Improvements:** The provided JavaScript code implements the logic more explicitly than the pseudocode, handling vocabulary access and token sampling. It also addresses potential out-of-vocabulary issues and provides a basic implementation of the `generateCodebook` function, making the code more executable.\n\n**Explanation of `decoder` function:**\n\n* **Purpose:** Retrieves the embedded chronicle from the generated text.\n* **Algorithm:**\n    1. Tokenizes the input text.\n    2. Iterates through all possible chronicles.\n    3. For each chronicle, retrieves the corresponding codeword from the `codebook`.\n    4. Counts how many times tokens marked in the codeword appear in the generated text (`frequency`).\n    5. The chronicle with the highest `frequency` is selected as the most likely chronicle.\n* **Key Improvements:** Handles chronicle retrieval more precisely by using a frequency-based comparison and adds clarity regarding the processing of the vocabulary and tokenization/detokenization.\n\n\n**Explanation of `main` function:**\nThis function provides a basic structure of how the encoder and decoder would be used in a multi-agent text generation scenario. It sets up the vocabulary, agents, codebook, and chronicle, iterates through timesteps, and at each step simulates assigning text generation to an agent, encoding the chronicle, generating the text, and then decoding the chronicle back from the generated text.\n\n\n**Explanation of helper functions:** These are placeholder functions that would need to be implemented according to the specifics of your LLM, vocabulary, and text pre-processing pipeline.  They are crucial for the proper functioning of the `encoder` and `decoder` functions.\n\n\n**Key Overall Improvements in the JavaScript Code:**\n\n* **Executable Code:** Unlike pseudocode, this is functional JavaScript code that can be run (with the helper functions implemented).\n* **Clarity:** The code is more explicit and detailed, making the implementation steps clearer.\n* **Helper Functions:** The addition of helper functions improves code structure and readability.\n* **Vocabulary Handling:** The code demonstrates the basic structure for handling vocabulary, tokenization, and detokenization, although the specific implementations of these would depend on the user's setup.\n\n\nThis improved JavaScript code provides a much better starting point for developers who wish to experiment with this chronological provenance system in their own projects. Remember to replace the placeholder helper functions with your actual implementations.",
