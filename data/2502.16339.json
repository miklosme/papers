  "title": "Dynamic Coalition Structure Detection in Natural Language-based Interactions",
  "abstract": "In strategic multi-agent sequential interactions, detecting dynamic coalition structures is crucial for understanding how self-interested agents coordinate to influence outcomes. However, natural-language-based interactions introduce unique challenges to coalition detection due to ambiguity over intents and difficulty in modeling players' subjective perspectives. We propose a new method that leverages recent advancements in large language models and game theory to predict dynamic multilateral coalition formation in Diplomacy, a strategic multi-agent game where agents negotiate coalitions using natural language. The method consists of two stages. The first stage extracts the set of agreements discussed by two agents in their private dialogue, by combining a parsing-based filtering function with a fine-tuned language model trained to predict player intents. In the second stage, we define a new metric using the concept of subjective rationalizability from hypergame theory to evaluate the expected value of an agreement for each player. We then compute this metric for each agreement identified in the first stage by assessing the strategic value of the agreement for both players and taking into account the subjective belief of one player that the second player would honor the agreement. We demonstrate that our method effectively detects potential coalition structures in online Diplomacy gameplay by assigning high values to agreements likely to be honored and low values to those likely to be violated. The proposed method provides foundational insights into coalition formation in multi-agent environments with language-based negotiation and offers key directions for future research on the analysis of complex natural language-based interactions between agents.",
  "summary": "This paper tackles the challenge of predicting how and why alliances form in multi-agent systems where agents communicate using natural language, specifically within the game of Diplomacy.  It proposes a two-stage method: 1) detect potential agreements from the dialogue using a combination of large language models (LLMs) and game-specific intent models, and 2) evaluate the likelihood of those agreements being honored using a game-theoretic approach called \"subjective rationalizability\" which considers each agent's individual perspective and uncertainty.  Key for LLM-based multi-agent systems, the work demonstrates the effectiveness of combining LLMs for dialogue parsing with game-theoretic reasoning for strategic prediction in a complex, partially observable environment. The combination of intent recognition from specialized models with broader LLM context parsing is also highlighted.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents a fascinating approach to detecting dynamic coalition structures in multi-agent systems using natural language, particularly relevant for JavaScript developers working with LLM-powered agents in web applications. Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights:\n\n**1. Agreement Detection in Chat Applications:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine building a collaborative project management app where teams interact through a chat interface.  You want to automatically identify agreements made between team members regarding task assignments, deadlines, or resource allocation.\n\n* **Implementation:**\n    * **Frontend (JavaScript):**  Use a library like `compromise` or `nlp.js` for basic natural language processing to extract keywords related to tasks, deadlines, resources, and users mentioned in the chat messages. This pre-filtering step mirrors the paper's initial filtering stage.\n    * **Backend (Node.js):**  Send the filtered text to a backend service powered by an LLM fine-tuned for intent recognition (similar to CICERO's intent models). The LLM can be accessed via an API like OpenAI's.  Train a classification model (using `TensorFlow.js` or similar) on the LLM's output to predict if an agreement has been reached. Store these predicted agreements in a database.\n\n* **Example:** If a user types \"Okay, @John, I'll handle the design by Friday, and you'll take care of the implementation,\" the system should be able to extract  `[\"design\", \"@John\", \"Friday\", \"implementation\"]` and use the LLM to infer the intent and predict an agreement on task allocation.\n\n**2. Dynamic Coalition Formation in Online Games:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Develop a real-time strategy game where players can form and break alliances through in-game chat.  You want the game to recognize these alliances and adjust game mechanics accordingly.\n\n* **Implementation:**\n    * **Frontend (JavaScript):**  Similar to the chat application example, use NLP libraries to pre-process chat messages and send them to a backend LLM for intent recognition.\n    * **Backend (Node.js):** The LLM can be specialized on game-specific language, like requests for support or declarations of war. The rationalizability score, as described in the paper, can be approximated using a combination of the LLM output and game-state information (e.g., relative strengths of players). This requires defining a utility function based on game objectives. Use a graph database (like `Neo4j`) to represent the dynamic coalition structure, with edges representing agreements and weights representing the rationalizability scores. Update this graph in real time based on the detected agreements.\n\n* **Example:** If player A messages player B, \"Let's attack C together. I'll provide air support, you handle the ground troops,\" the system extracts `[\"attack\", \"C\", \"air support\", \"ground troops\"]`, infers the intent of forming an alliance against C, assesses the current game state, and computes a rationalizability score reflecting the likelihood of this alliance happening.\n\n**3.  Collaborative Filtering in E-commerce:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  Build an e-commerce platform with a social aspect, where users can discuss products and form buying groups to get discounts.\n\n* **Implementation:**\n    * **Frontend (JavaScript):** Analyze user comments and discussions using NLP techniques. Filter relevant keywords and product mentions.\n    * **Backend (Node.js):**  An LLM can analyze the filtered comments and predict the likelihood of users forming a buying group.  This prediction can be based on the language used, the products discussed, and potentially other user data like purchase history. Similar to the gaming example, a rationalizability score can be computed to represent the strength of the potential buying group.\n\n* **Example:**  Users discussing a particular laptop model and mentioning terms like \"group buy,\" \"split the cost,\" or \"bulk discount\" might trigger the system to identify a potential buying group.\n\n**JavaScript Libraries and Frameworks:**\n\n* **NLP:**  `compromise`, `nlp.js`, `natural`.\n* **LLM Integration:**  OpenAI API, Hugging Face Inference API.\n* **Machine Learning:** `TensorFlow.js`, `Brain.js`.\n* **Graph Databases:** `Neo4j` (requires a Node.js backend).\n\n**Key Takeaways for JavaScript Developers:**\n\n* **Hybrid approach:** Combining rule-based NLP with the power of LLMs for intent recognition is key to efficiently detecting agreements in complex, noisy natural language interactions.\n* **Rationalizability score:** This concept provides a valuable framework for assessing the likelihood of agents adhering to agreements, incorporating both game-theoretic value and beliefs about other agents.\n* **Dynamic coalition structures:**  Representing coalition structures as weighted graphs allows you to capture the fluidity and uncertainty inherent in real-world multi-agent interactions.\n\nBy adapting these ideas and utilizing the appropriate JavaScript tools, developers can create innovative web applications that leverage the power of LLM-based multi-agent AI systems.",
  "pseudocode": "No pseudocode block found. However, the paper describes a two-stage approach to predict dynamic coalition structures in natural language-based interactions, using the game Diplomacy as a testbed. Here are the algorithms described, conceptualized in JavaScript terms:\n\n**Stage 1: Agreement Detection**\n\n```javascript\nasync function detectAgreements(state, player1, player2, dialogue) {\n  // 1. Extract mentioned locations using GPT-4\n  const mentionedLocations = await gpt4.extractLocations(dialogue, state);\n\n  const agreements = [];\n\n  for (const unit of state.unitsOf(player1).concat(state.unitsOf(player2))) {\n    // 2. Filter based on location and adjacency\n    if (!mentionedLocations.some(loc => unit.moveOptions.includes(loc)) ||\n        !areAdjacent(unit.location, mentionedLocations)) {\n      continue;\n    }\n\n    // 3. Extract intents using CICERO intent model\n    const intentsBefore = await ciceroIntentModel.predict(state, dialogue, unit);\n    const intentsAfter = await ciceroIntentModel.predict(\n        state, dialogue, unit, postDialogue = true);\n\n    // 4. Classify agreement based on intent distribution change\n    const features = extractFeatures(intentsBefore, intentsAfter);\n    const isAgreement = await agreementClassifier.predict(features);\n\n    if (isAgreement) {\n      agreements.push({ unit, action: intentsAfter.mostLikelyAction }); // Simplified representation\n    }\n  }\n\n  return agreements;\n}\n```\n* **Purpose:** This stage aims to identify potential agreements between two players based on their dialogue and the game state.\n* **Explanation:** It first extracts locations mentioned in the dialogue using a large language model (GPT-4). It then filters these locations based on their relevance to possible unit movements. Next, a Diplomacy-specific intent model (CICERO) is used to predict the players' likely actions before and after the dialogue. Finally, a classifier, trained on changes in intent distributions and location/adjacency information, determines whether an agreement has been reached regarding a unit's action.\n\n\n**Stage 2: Strategic Reasoning (Rationalizability Score)**\n\n\n```javascript\nasync function calculateRationalizabilityScore(state, agreement, playeri) {\n  const playerj = getOtherPlayer(agreement, playeri);\n\n  // 1. Calculate strategic value (Vi) using CICERO value model & DORA\n  let value = 0;\n  const numSamples = 100; // Number of samples from joint action distribution\n\n  for (let i = 0; i < numSamples; i++) {\n      const jointAction = await ciceroOrderModel.sample(state, agreement);\n      const nextState = transitionFunction(state, jointAction);\n      value += await ciceroValueModel.predict(nextState, playeri);\n  }\n    \n  const Vi = value / numSamples;\n\n    // 2. Estimate perceived value to opponent (Vj)\n  const intents = await ciceroIntentModel.predict(state, dialogue, agreement.unit);\n  const Vj = calculatePerceivedValue(intents, agreement, playerj);\n\n  return Vi * Vj;\n}\n\nfunction calculatePerceivedValue(intents, agreement, playerj) {\n    // ... Logic to approximate how player i thinks player j values the agreement based on intents\n}\n\n```\n* **Purpose:** This stage determines the likelihood of each agreement being honored by both players.\n* **Explanation:** It uses a combination of game-theoretic reasoning and player intent analysis. For each player involved in an agreement, it calculates the strategic value of the agreement using a deep reinforcement learning-based value model (from CICERO) and the DORA algorithm for sampling plausible joint actions. It also estimates the perceived value of the agreement to the opponent based on their inferred intents. The rationalizability score is the product of these two values, reflecting the subjective rationality of the agreement for both players.\n\n\nThese JavaScript conceptualizations illustrate the algorithms described in the paper.  Note that implementing these would require access to models like GPT-4, and the CICERO components (Intent and Order/Value models) or training equivalent models.  This response provides a practical translation for JavaScript developers aiming to understand and potentially experiment with these concepts in multi-agent application development.",
