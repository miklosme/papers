  "title": "Achieving Unanimous Consensus in Decision Making Using Multi-Agents",
  "abstract": "Abstract-Blockchain consensus mechanisms have relied on algorithms such as Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) to ensure network functionality and integrity. However, these approaches struggle with adaptability for decision-making where the opinions of each matter rather than reaching an agreement based on honest majority or weighted consensus. This paper introduces a novel deliberation-based consensus mechanism where Large Language Models (LLMs) act as rational agents engaging in structured discussions to reach a unanimous consensus. By leveraging graded consensus and a multi-round deliberation process, our approach ensures both unanimous consensus for definitive problems and graded confidence for prioritized decisions and policies. We provide a formalization of our system and use it to show that the properties of blockchains: consistency, agreement, liveness, and determinism are maintained. Moreover, experimental results demonstrate our system's feasibility, showcasing how our deliberation method's convergence, block properties, and accuracy enable decision-making on blockchain networks. We also address key challenges with this novel approach such as degeneration of thoughts, hallucinations, malicious models and nodes, resource consumption, and scalability.",
  "summary": "This paper proposes a novel blockchain consensus mechanism using Large Language Models (LLMs) as multi-agents that engage in structured deliberations to reach unanimous agreement.  Unlike traditional Proof-of-Work or Proof-of-Stake, this approach prioritizes individual opinions and nuanced discussion.\n\nKey points for LLM-based multi-agent systems:  LLMs act as deliberating agents, exchanging and refining arguments through iterative rounds (turns) to achieve consensus.  The framework uses a hybrid of zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompting, and the number of agents and turns influences convergence speed and accuracy.  Challenges like LLM hallucinations, resource consumption, and security risks are acknowledged, and potential solutions like judge systems, reputation-based incentives, and watermarking are proposed.  The system is implemented on the Nimiq blockchain as a proof of concept.",
  "takeaways": "This research paper presents a fascinating approach to achieving consensus in multi-agent systems using LLMs, offering several avenues for experimentation in web development. Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights:\n\n**1. Building a Collaborative Writing Tool:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine a collaborative writing platform where multiple users (represented by LLM agents) contribute to a single document.  The goal is to reach a consensus on the final text through structured deliberation.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * **Frontend:**  Use a framework like React or Vue.js to build a user interface displaying the evolving document, individual agent contributions, and the deliberation history.\n    * **Backend:** Node.js with a library like LangChain or LlamaIndex could manage interactions with the LLMs.  Implement the proposed deliberation rounds (initial, reflection, conclusion) as asynchronous functions.  Store deliberation history in a database (e.g., MongoDB).\n    * **Agent Specialization:** Each agent could be assigned a different writing style or persona (e.g., formal, informal, creative) to enrich the deliberation.\n* **JavaScript Example (Conceptual):**\n\n```javascript\nasync function reflectionRound(agents, problem, turns) {\n  for (let t = 0; t < turns; t++) {\n    for (const agent of agents) {\n      const prompt = buildPrompt(problem, agent.previousUtterance, neighborsUtterances); // LangChain/LlamaIndex\n      const utterance = await agent.llm.generate(prompt);\n      // Update UI, store utterance in history\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**2. Developing an Interactive Design Platform:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Create a platform for collaborative design (e.g., website mockups, product prototypes). Multiple LLM agents, each with a different design aesthetic or expertise (e.g., UX, UI, accessibility), contribute to a design iteratively, aiming for a consensus design.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * **Frontend:** A JavaScript canvas library (e.g., Fabric.js, Konva) would be ideal for visualizing the evolving design.\n    * **Backend:**  Similar to the writing tool, Node.js with LangChain/LlamaIndex would manage LLM interactions.  Utterances could be translated into design modifications using an intermediate representation (e.g., JSON describing design elements).\n    * **Agent Specialization:** Train agents on different design principles or datasets to introduce diverse perspectives.\n* **JavaScript Example (Conceptual):**\n\n```javascript\nfunction applyUtteranceToDesign(utterance, canvas) {\n  const designChanges = parseDesignInstructions(utterance); // Custom parsing logic\n  designChanges.forEach(change => {\n    // Add/modify design elements on the canvas\n    if (change.type === 'addShape') {\n      canvas.add(new fabric.Rect(change.params)); \n    } // ...\n  });\n}\n```\n\n**3. Creating a Decentralized Decision-Making Application (DApp):**\n\n* **Scenario:**  Build a DApp for community governance or decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) where proposals are debated by LLM agents representing different stakeholders.  Consensus reached through deliberation determines the proposal's outcome.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * **Frontend:**  A framework like React, or a Web3-specific framework could be used. Display proposals, agent arguments, and voting results.\n    * **Backend:**  Integrate with a blockchain (e.g., Ethereum, Nimiq as used in the paper) using Web3.js.  Store deliberation history and consensus outcomes on the blockchain.  Smart contracts could automate actions based on the consensus.\n    * **Agent Specialization:**  LLMs could be trained on relevant DAO documents, proposals, and community sentiment to reflect stakeholder interests.\n* **JavaScript Example (Conceptual â€“ Web3.js):**\n\n```javascript\nasync function storeConsensusOnChain(consensusResult, contract) {\n  const accounts = await web3.eth.getAccounts();\n  await contract.methods.recordDecision(consensusResult).send({ from: accounts[0] });\n}\n```\n\n**Key Considerations for JavaScript Developers:**\n\n* **Asynchronous Operations:** Deliberation rounds involve asynchronous LLM calls. Use `async/await` and Promises effectively.\n* **UI Updates:**  Provide real-time feedback on the deliberation process using reactive UI frameworks.\n* **Prompt Engineering:** Crafting effective prompts is crucial. Experiment with different prompt structures, including CoT and zero-shot prompting as discussed in the paper.\n* **LLM Selection:** Choose LLMs based on performance, cost, and specific requirements. Consider open-source LLMs or fine-tuned models for specialized tasks.\n* **Scalability:**  Address potential scalability issues, especially when dealing with many agents or complex deliberations.\n\nBy adapting these ideas and examples, JavaScript developers can leverage the insights of this research to create innovative and powerful LLM-based multi-agent applications for the web. Remember to focus on clear UI/UX design and effective prompt engineering for a smooth and engaging user experience.  This is an exciting area of research, and practical experimentation will be key to unlocking its full potential.",
  "pseudocode": "The paper includes pseudocode blocks for two algorithms: Initial Prompting and Iterative Prompting. Here's the JavaScript conversion and explanations for each:\n\n**Algorithm 1: Initial Prompting**\n\n```javascript\nasync function initialPrompting(problem, llm, numAgents, cotRatio = 0.5) {\n  let initialResponses = [];\n  let cotGroupSize = Math.round(numAgents * cotRatio); // Size of CoT group\n\n  for (let i = 0; i < numAgents; i++) {\n    let prompt;\n    if (i < cotGroupSize) {\n      prompt = createCOTPrompt(problem); // Construct Chain-of-Thought prompt\n    } else {\n      prompt = createZSPrompt(problem);  // Construct Zero-Shot prompt\n    }\n    let response = await llm(prompt, problem); // Await LLM response (assumes async)\n    initialResponses.push(response);\n  }\n  return initialResponses;\n}\n\n\n// Helper functions to construct different prompt types.\nfunction createCOTPrompt(problem) {\n  return `Think step by step. ${problem}`; // Placeholder: replace with actual CoT structure\n}\n\nfunction createZSPrompt(problem) {\n  return problem; // Zero-shot prompt can be the problem itself.\n}\n\n\n// Example Usage:\n// Assuming 'llm' is an async function that takes a prompt and problem as input and returns a response.\nlet problem = \"Solve 2 + 2\";\nlet numAgents = 4;\nlet initialResponses = await initialPrompting(problem, llm, numAgents); \nconsole.log(initialResponses);\n```\n\n**Explanation:** This algorithm gathers initial responses from multiple LLMs (represented by the `llm` function) for a given `problem`.  It uses a mix of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Zero-Shot (ZS) prompting to simulate diverse initial opinions. The `cotRatio` parameter controls the proportion of LLMs that receive CoT prompts.  Helper functions `createCOTPrompt` and `createZSPrompt` illustrate how to construct different prompt types; they should be replaced with your specific prompt engineering logic. The code utilizes async/await to handle the asynchronous nature of LLM interactions.\n\n\n**Algorithm 2: Iterative Prompting (Prompt Chaining)**\n\n```javascript\nasync function iterativePrompting(problem, llm, numAgents, numTurns) {\n  let allResponses = [];\n  let currentRoundResponses = await initialPrompting(problem, llm, numAgents); // Get initial responses\n  allResponses.push(currentRoundResponses);\n\n  for (let turn = 0; turn < numTurns; turn++) {\n    let nextRoundResponses = [];\n    for (let i = 0; i < numAgents; i++) {\n      let prevResponse = currentRoundResponses[i];\n      let neighborResponses = getNeighborResponses(currentRoundResponses, i);\n\n      let prompt = createIterativePrompt(problem, prevResponse, neighborResponses);\n      let response = await llm(prompt, problem); // Get LLM response\n      nextRoundResponses.push(response);\n    }\n    allResponses.push(nextRoundResponses);\n    currentRoundResponses = nextRoundResponses;\n  }\n\n  return allResponses;\n}\n\n\n// Helper function to get responses of neighboring agents\nfunction getNeighborResponses(responses, agentIndex) {\n  let numAgents = responses.length;\n  let leftNeighbor = responses[(agentIndex - 1 + numAgents) % numAgents];\n  let rightNeighbor = responses[(agentIndex + 1) % numAgents];\n  return [leftNeighbor, rightNeighbor]; // Returns responses from left and right neighbors\n}\n\nfunction createIterativePrompt(problem, prevResponse, neighborResponses) {\n  return `${problem} \\nYour previous answer: ${prevResponse}\\nNeighbor's answers: ${neighborResponses.join('\\n')}`; // Example\n}\n\n\n// Example usage\nlet problem = \"Decide on a course of action\";\nlet numAgents = 3;\nlet numTurns = 2;\nlet allResponses = await iterativePrompting(problem, llm, numAgents, numTurns);\nconsole.log(allResponses);\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:** This algorithm implements the iterative deliberation process.  It uses the `initialPrompting` function to get initial responses. Then, for each `turn`, it generates new responses for each agent, incorporating their previous response and their neighbors' responses from the previous turn into the prompt.  The `getNeighborResponses` helper function handles retrieving the neighbor's responses (assuming a ring topology). The `createIterativePrompt` function demonstrates how to construct the prompt for each iteration, combining the original `problem`, the agent's previous `response`, and `neighborResponses`. It utilizes async/await similar to the first algorithm. This iterative process allows agents to refine their answers based on the ongoing discussion.",
