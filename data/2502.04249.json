  "title": "FREE ENERGY RISK METRICS FOR SYSTEMICALLY SAFE AI: GATEKEEPING MULTI-AGENT STUDY",
  "abstract": "We investigate the Free Energy Principle as a foundation for measuring risk in agentic and multi-agent systems. From these principles we introduce a Cumulative Risk Exposure metric that is flexible to differing contexts and needs. We contrast this to other popular theories for safe AI that hinge on massive amounts of data or describing arbitrarily complex world models. In our framework, stakeholders need only specify their preferences over system outcomes, providing straightforward and transparent decision rules for risk governance and mitigation. This framework naturally accounts for uncertainty in both world model and preference model, allowing for decision-making that is epistemically and axiologically humble, parsimonious, and future-proof. We demonstrate this novel approach in a simplified autonomous vehicle environment with multi-agent vehicles whose driving policies are mediated by gatekeepers that evaluate, in an online fashion, the risk to the collective safety in their neighborhood, and intervene through each vehicle's policy when appropriate. We show that the introduction of gatekeepers in an AV fleet, even at low penetration, can generate significant positive externalities in terms of increased system safety.",
  "summary": "This paper proposes using the Free Energy Principle (FEP) from Active Inference to measure and mitigate risk in multi-agent AI systems.  It introduces a Cumulative Risk Exposure (CRE) metric, calculable via Monte Carlo simulations, that allows stakeholders to define preferences and tolerances for undesirable outcomes. The system uses a \"gatekeeper\" which monitors agents' planned actions, calculating CRE based on simulated futures. If the CRE exceeds a threshold, the gatekeeper intervenes, modifying the agent's policy to a safer alternative. This is demonstrated in a simulated autonomous vehicle environment where gatekeepers improve overall system safety by preventing risky driving behaviors.\n\nKey points for LLM-based multi-agent systems:\n\n* **FEP and CRE offer a first-principles approach to AI safety** by embedding stakeholder preferences into a probabilistic framework and providing a quantifiable risk metric.\n* **Gatekeepers can function as a safety layer**, evaluating and overriding LLM-generated actions if they are deemed too risky based on simulated outcomes.\n* **Preference priors and temperature parameters** provide a flexible and interpretable way to specify safety constraints and risk tolerance for LLMs.\n* **Collective intelligence through information sharing between gatekeepers** further enhances decision-making by accounting for interactions between agents.  This could be implemented by sharing LLM context or internal representations among agents.\n* **This approach shifts focus from complex world modeling** (required in some other safety frameworks) to preference specification, which is potentially simpler and more adaptable for different applications.",
  "takeaways": "This paper introduces the concept of Cumulative Risk Exposure (CRE) as a metric for evaluating and mitigating risk in multi-agent systems, particularly relevant for LLM-based agents in web development. Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights:\n\n**1. Building a Gatekeeper System for LLM-driven Chatbots:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine a customer service chatbot powered by an LLM. The chatbot can sometimes generate inappropriate or misleading responses. A gatekeeper can intercept these responses and prevent them from reaching the user.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * Use a JavaScript library like LangChain to create and manage your LLM-powered chatbot.  LangChain provides tools for chains and agents, which are relevant to this multi-agent scenario.\n    * Develop a \"gatekeeper\" function that assesses the risk of the chatbot's generated response. This function can leverage:\n        * Sentiment analysis libraries (e.g., Sentiment) to detect negative or offensive language.\n        * Toxicity detection APIs (e.g., Perspective API) to flag harmful content.\n        * Custom rules based on domain-specific knowledge or company policies.\n    * If the gatekeeper identifies high CRE, it can:\n        * Replace the risky response with a safer alternative (e.g., \"I'm not sure I understand your question. Can you rephrase it?\").\n        * Escalate the conversation to a human agent.\n        * Log the risky response for further analysis and improvement of the LLM or gatekeeper.\n\n**2. Collaborative Filtering with Risk Mitigation:**\n\n* **Scenario:** A multi-agent system recommends products to users based on their browsing history and preferences. Some recommendations might be risky (e.g., inappropriate for the user's age or potentially harmful).\n* **Implementation:**\n    * Each agent can specialize in a particular product category or aspect of user preferences.\n    * Agents communicate and negotiate to create a final recommendation list.\n    * A gatekeeper analyzes the combined recommendations, assessing CRE based on user profiles, product features, and potential negative consequences.\n    * High CRE recommendations are filtered out or replaced with safer options.\n\n**3. Real-time Game Moderation:**\n\n* **Scenario:** In a multiplayer online game, LLM-powered agents can control non-player characters (NPCs) or provide assistance to players. However, their actions might have unintended negative consequences for the game environment or other players.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * Gatekeepers monitor the game state and agent actions.\n    * They assess CRE based on pre-defined rules or real-time feedback from players.\n    * Gatekeepers can intervene to prevent harmful actions, modify agent behavior, or penalize players.\n\n**4. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs):**\n\n* **Scenario:** LLM agents can automate tasks and make decisions within a DAO. A gatekeeper system ensures these decisions align with the DAO's goals and mitigate risks.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * The gatekeeper evaluates proposals generated by LLM agents, assessing their potential impact on the DAO's resources, reputation, and legal compliance.\n    * High CRE proposals are flagged or automatically rejected.\n\n**JavaScript Libraries and Frameworks:**\n\n* **LangChain:** Facilitates development of applications powered by language models. Ideal for creating and managing LLM-powered agents and chains, and integrating external data sources and APIs.\n* **TensorFlow.js:** Enables running machine learning models in the browser for client-side risk assessment and policy selection.\n* **Web Workers:** Allow performing computationally intensive risk calculations in the background without blocking the main thread, improving application responsiveness.\n* **WebSockets:** Enable real-time communication between agents and gatekeepers for efficient monitoring and intervention.\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n\n* **Defining the Loss Function:**  Crucially, the paper emphasizes the importance of a well-defined loss function representing stakeholder preferences. The loss function is the foundation for calculating CRE.\n* **Calibrating the Preference Temperature (Î²):** This parameter controls the balance between maximizing expected outcomes and minimizing uncertainty. Careful calibration is crucial for achieving desired behavior.\n* **Transparency and Explainability:** Gatekeeper decisions should be transparent and explainable, especially in sensitive applications. This builds trust and facilitates debugging and improvement.\n\n\nBy applying these concepts and tools, JavaScript developers can create safer and more robust web applications powered by LLM-based multi-agent systems. This is a cutting-edge area with potential for significant advancements in web development practices.",
