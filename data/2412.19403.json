  "title": "FULLY DATA-DRIVEN BUT INTERPRETABLE HUMAN BEHAVIOURAL MODELLING WITH DIFFERENTIABLE DISCRETE CHOICE MODEL",
  "abstract": "Discrete choice models are essential for modelling various decision-making processes in human behaviour. However, the specification of these models has depended heavily on domain knowledge from experts, and the fully automated but interpretable modelling of complex human behaviours has been a long-standing challenge. In this paper, we introduce the differentiable discrete choice model (Diff-DCM), a fully data-driven method for the interpretable modelling, learning, prediction, and control of complex human behaviours, which is realised by differentiable programming. Solely from input features and choice outcomes without any prior knowledge, Diff-DCM can estimate interpretable closed-form utility functions that reproduce observed behaviours. Comprehensive experiments with both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that Diff-DCM can be applied to various types of data and requires only a small amount of computational resources for the estimations, which can be completed within tens of seconds on a laptop without any accelerators. In these experiments, we also demonstrate that, using its differentiability, Diff-DCM can provide useful insights into human behaviours, such as an optimal intervention path for effective behavioural changes. This study provides a strong basis for the fully automated and reliable modelling, prediction, and control of human behaviours.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces Diff-DCM, a novel method for creating data-driven, interpretable models of human decision-making.  It uses differentiable programming to automatically learn complex utility functions from observed choices, eliminating the need for hand-crafted models based on expert knowledge. This allows for faster model creation, potential for greater accuracy, and the ability to conduct sensitivity analysis and calculate optimal intervention paths to influence behavior.\n\n\nFor LLM-based multi-agent systems, Diff-DCM offers a potential way to model agent behavior based on observed data, improving their realism and facilitating a better understanding of their decision-making processes.  The automated nature of Diff-DCM aligns well with the data-driven approach of LLMs, making it suitable for creating complex agent behaviors without extensive manual design. The differentiability also opens avenues for optimizing agent interactions and learning within multi-agent simulations.",
  "takeaways": "This paper introduces Diff-DCM, a differentiable discrete choice model, which offers JavaScript developers a novel approach to building more interpretable and data-driven multi-agent systems using LLMs. Here are some practical examples applied to web development:\n\n**1. Interactive Narrative Generation:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine a choose-your-own-adventure game where user choices drive the story.  Multiple LLM-powered agents (e.g., characters) could make decisions based on user input and their own internal \"utility functions,\" learned via Diff-DCM.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * **Frontend:** Use a framework like React or Vue.js to manage the user interface, displaying story text and choice options.\n    * **Backend:** Node.js with a library like TensorFlow.js or WebDNN can implement the Diff-DCM model.  Train the model on user interaction data (choices made given story context), to learn each agent's utility function. This allows agents to behave more realistically, aligning their choices with player expectations.\n    * **LLM Integration:** Integrate with a cloud-based LLM API.  Prompt the LLM with context including agent choices to generate narrative responses based on those decisions.\n\n**2. Collaborative Design Tools:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  A multi-agent system for collaborative design where each agent (represented by an LLM) specializes in a different aspect of the design process (e.g., aesthetics, functionality, cost).  Diff-DCM allows these agents to negotiate and make design choices based on learned preferences.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * **Frontend:** A real-time collaborative whiteboard application using Fabric.js or Konva.js. Agents and users can interact visually.\n    * **Backend:**  Node.js with TensorFlow.js implements Diff-DCM. Agents learn preferences based on user feedback on design iterations. The learned utility functions allow them to suggest and evaluate design alternatives autonomously.\n    * **LLM Integration:** The backend uses an LLM API.  Agents use the LLM to communicate their rationale for design decisions to the human users in natural language.\n\n\n**3. Personalized Recommendation Systems:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  An e-commerce site with multiple LLM-powered recommendation agents, each specializing in a product category. Diff-DCM allows the agents to personalize recommendations based on nuanced user preferences learned over time.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * **Frontend:**  Standard e-commerce frontend with JavaScript frameworks.\n    * **Backend:**  Diff-DCM model running on Node.js with TensorFlow.js. User browsing history and purchase data are used to train the model and learn each agent's utility function for different product features.\n    * **LLM Integration:**  The LLM can be used to generate personalized explanations for recommendations, increasing transparency and trust.\n\n**4. Simulated Social Environments for Research:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  Simulate a virtual market with multiple LLM-based buyer and seller agents. Diff-DCM allows researchers to model agent behaviors more realistically by learning utility functions from actual market data, providing insights into market dynamics.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * **Frontend:**  A visualization library like D3.js can display the market dynamics.\n    * **Backend:**  Node.js server handles the simulation logic and agent interactions. Diff-DCM learns utility functions based on simulated or real market data.\n    * **LLM Integration:** LLMs act as the \"brains\" of the agents, making decisions based on market conditions and learned utility functions.\n\n\n**Key JavaScript Technologies and Considerations:**\n\n* **TensorFlow.js/WebDNN:** Enable in-browser or server-side model training and inference.\n* **React/Vue.js/Angular:**  For building interactive user interfaces.\n* **Node.js:** Server-side JavaScript runtime for running Diff-DCM and interacting with LLMs.\n* **Cloud LLM APIs:** For accessing powerful LLMs.\n* **Data Management:** Implement efficient data storage and retrieval for training and using the Diff-DCM models.\n\nBy combining Diff-DCM with LLMs, JavaScript developers can create more realistic, adaptable, and transparent multi-agent applications.  The ability to learn complex utility functions directly from data opens up exciting possibilities for simulating and interacting with virtual worlds within web applications.",
  "pseudocode": "The pseudocode block is found in Algorithm 1 and describes the logic for synthesizing a dataset based on logical conditions rather than utility functions. This approach aims to create a dataset that mimics real-world scenarios where the underlying data generation mechanism might be unknown and potentially discontinuous, posing challenges for traditional utility-based choice models.\n\n```javascript\nfunction synthesizeDataWithLogicalConditions(numSamples) {\n  const data = [];\n\n  for (let i = 0; i < numSamples; i++) {\n    const x1 = Math.random() * 10; // x1 ~ U(0, 10)\n    const x2 = Math.random() * 10; // x2 ~ U(0, 10)\n    let choice;\n\n    if (x1 >= 5.0 && x2 >= 5.0) {\n      choice = 1;\n    } else if (x1 < 5.0 && x2 >= 5.0) {\n      choice = 2;\n    } else if (x1 < 5.0 && x2 < 5.0) {\n      choice = 3;\n    } else { // x1 >= 5.0 && x2 < 5.0\n      choice = 4;\n    }\n\n    data.push({ x1, x2, choice });\n  }\n\n  return data;\n}\n\n// Example usage: generate 1000 data points\nconst dataset = synthesizeDataWithLogicalConditions(1000);\nconsole.log(dataset);\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe `synthesizeDataWithLogicalConditions` function generates a specified `numSamples` of data points. Each data point consists of two features (`x1` and `x2`), drawn from a uniform distribution between 0 and 10, and a `choice` variable. The `choice` is determined based on a set of nested `if-else` conditions operating on `x1` and `x2`.  This creates four distinct regions in the feature space, each corresponding to a specific choice.  This method creates a dataset with abrupt changes in choice probabilities based on the feature values, making it a challenging scenario for traditional DCMs that assume smoother utility functions. This design allows researchers to test the robustness of their models when faced with data that doesn't strictly adhere to the assumptions of utility-based decision-making.  The generated dataset can be used to train and evaluate the Diff-DCM model, assessing its ability to learn complex decision boundaries even when the data isn't generated from a traditional utility function.",
