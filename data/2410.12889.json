  "title": "Using Protected Attributes to Consider Fairness in Multi-Agent Systems",
  "abstract": "Fairness in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) has been extensively studied, particularly in reward distribution among agents in scenarios such as goods allocation, resource division, lotteries, and bargaining systems. Fairness in MAS depends on various factors, including the system's governing rules, the behaviour of the agents, and their characteristics. Yet, fairness in human society often involves evaluating disparities between disadvantaged and privileged groups, guided by principles of Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI). Taking inspiration from the work on algorithmic fairness, which addresses bias in machine learning-based decision-making, we define protected attributes for MAS as characteristics that should not disadvantage an agent in terms of its expected rewards. We adapt fairness metrics from the algorithmic fairness literature-namely, demographic parity, counterfactual fairness, and conditional statistical parity-to the multi-agent setting, where self-interested agents interact within an environment. These metrics allow us to evaluate the fairness of MAS, with the ultimate aim of designing MAS that do not disadvantage agents based on protected attributes.",
  "summary": "This research paper proposes a way to evaluate **fairness** in multi-agent AI systems, especially when some agents might be disadvantaged due to specific attributes. \n\nThe key takeaway for LLM-based systems is the concept of **\"protected attributes\"**.  These are characteristics that should not negatively impact an agent's performance (like being a human driver vs. an AI driver). The paper adapts existing fairness metrics to measure and potentially mitigate bias against agents with these protected attributes. This is crucial for developing LLM-based agents that interact fairly in shared environments, ensuring that certain agents aren't unfairly penalized based on inherent characteristics.",
  "takeaways": "This paper introduces the concept of  \"protected attributes\" in multi-agent systems (MAS) and adapts established fairness metrics for evaluating them. Here's how a JavaScript developer working on LLM-based multi-agent applications can apply these insights:\n\n**Scenario: Building a Collaborative Code Editor**\n\nImagine you're developing a collaborative code editor powered by LLMs. Multiple users (agents) can simultaneously edit code, receiving LLM suggestions and feedback. \n\n**1. Identifying Protected Attributes:**\n\nFirst, determine potentially sensitive user characteristics that should not lead to unfair advantages or disadvantages:\n\n* **Coding Experience:**  A beginner shouldn't receive overly simplistic suggestions compared to an expert.\n* **Programming Language Preference:** The system shouldn't favor users proficient in specific languages.\n* **Accessibility Needs:** Users with visual impairments relying on screen readers should have equal access and experience.\n\n**2. Applying Fairness Metrics (using JavaScript & relevant tools):**\n\nYou can measure and improve fairness using the metrics described in the paper. Since these metrics calculate expected rewards, you'll need to define a suitable reward function for your application. This function should quantify the value received by a user from the system (e.g., time saved by accepting a helpful suggestion).\n\nHere are some practical examples using JavaScript and related libraries:\n\n* **Demographic Parity (using simple statistics):** After collecting data on user interactions, group them by protected attributes (e.g., experience level). Calculate the average reward received by each group. Significant differences could indicate unfairness. \n\n    ```javascript\n    const experienceGroups = _.groupBy(userData, 'experienceLevel'); \n    _.forEach(experienceGroups, (groupData, level) => {\n        const avgReward = _.meanBy(groupData, 'reward'); \n        console.log(`Average reward for ${level}:`, avgReward);\n    });\n    ```\n\n* **Counterfactual Fairness (using A/B testing):** This is more complex but achievable. You can simulate a counterfactual world by creating two versions of your application: one where protected attributes influence LLM behavior and one where they don't. A/B test these versions with real users and compare their average rewards. Frameworks like  [A/B Tasty](https://www.abtasty.com/) or building custom solutions using Node.js can be helpful.\n\n* **Conditional Statistical Parity (using statistical analysis libraries):** This involves analyzing rewards while controlling for legitimate factors. For example, you might expect more experienced developers to generally have higher rewards due to their proficiency.  Using libraries like [Simple Statistics](https://simplestatistics.org/) or [ml.js](https://mljs.github.io/), you can calculate conditional probabilities and compare reward distributions across protected attribute groups within specific experience levels. \n\n**3. Mitigating Unfairness:**\n\nOnce you identify potential biases, you can take steps to mitigate them:\n\n* **Adjusting LLM Prompts:** Modify the prompts given to your LLM to encourage fairness. For example, include information about the user's experience level and explicitly request suggestions tailored to their needs.\n* **Personalized Reward Functions:**  Design reward functions that consider individual user needs and challenges. \n* **Diverse Training Data:**  Ensure your LLM is trained on data representing diverse coding styles, experience levels, and accessibility needs.\n\n**By combining the theoretical framework presented in this paper with practical JavaScript tools and techniques, developers can build more inclusive and ethical LLM-powered web applications.**",
