  "title": "Enhancing LLMs for Power System Simulations: A Feedback-driven Multi-agent Framework",
  "abstract": "Abstract-The integration of experimental technologies with large language models (LLMs) is transforming scientific research, positioning AI as a versatile research assistant rather than a mere problem-solving tool. In the field of power systems, however, managing simulations remains a challenge for LLMs due to their limited domain-specific knowledge, restricted reasoning capabilities, and imprecise handling of simulation parameters. To address these limitations, we propose a feedback-driven, multi-agent framework that incorporates three proposed modules: an enhanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module, an improved reasoning module, and a dynamic environmental acting module with an error-feedback mechanism. Validated on 69 diverse tasks from DALINE and MATPOWER, this framework achieves success rates of 93.13% and 96.85%, respectively, significantly outperforming the latest LLMs (ChatGPT 40 and o1-preview), which achieved a 27.77% success rate on standard simulation tasks and 0% on complex tasks. Additionally, our framework also supports rapid, cost-effective task execution, completing each simulation in approximately 30 seconds at an average cost of 0.014 USD for tokens. Overall, this adaptable framework lays a foundation for developing intelligent LLM-based assistants for human researchers, facilitating power system research and beyond.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces a feedback-driven multi-agent framework to improve the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform power system simulations.  Current LLMs struggle with these tasks due to limited domain-specific knowledge, weak reasoning capabilities, and difficulty handling simulation parameters. The framework addresses these issues with: 1) an enhanced retrieval augmented generation (RAG) system for accessing relevant information, 2) an improved reasoning module using chain-of-thought and few-shot prompting, and 3) an environmental action module that allows the LLM to interact with the simulation environment, receive feedback, and correct errors.  This multi-agent approach allows the LLM to learn and adapt, achieving significantly higher success rates on complex simulation tasks compared to baseline LLMs and even outperforming LLMs with standard RAG implementations. This framework demonstrates the potential of multi-agent systems to enhance LLM performance in specialized domains.",
  "takeaways": "This research paper offers several valuable insights for JavaScript developers working with LLM-based multi-agent systems in web applications. Here's how its concepts can be applied practically:\n\n**1. Enhanced Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) in JavaScript:**\n\n* **Adaptive Query Planning:** Instead of sending the entire user prompt to the LLM as a single query, decompose it into function-related and option-related sub-queries. This can be achieved using JavaScript's string manipulation methods and regular expressions.  For instance, if a user requests \"Simulate a power grid with 10 buses and perform an optimal power flow analysis,\" the query can be broken down into:\n    * Function: \"Power grid simulation\"\n    * Option 1: \"Number of buses: 10\"\n    * Option 2: \"Analysis type: Optimal power flow\"\n\n    ```javascript\n    const userPrompt = \"Simulate a power grid with 10 buses and perform an optimal power flow analysis.\";\n    const functionRegex = /simulate a power grid/i;\n    const optionsRegex = /(\\d+) buses|optimal power flow/gi;\n\n    const functionQuery = userPrompt.match(functionRegex)[0];\n    const optionsQueries = [...userPrompt.matchAll(optionsRegex)].map(match => match[0]);\n\n    console.log(\"Function:\", functionQuery);\n    console.log(\"Options:\", optionsQueries);\n    ```\n\n* **Triple-Based Knowledge Base:** Store domain-specific knowledge (like simulation parameters, functions, and their relationships) in a structured JSON format representing the triples (option, function, dependency). This enables efficient querying using JavaScript's array methods and libraries like Lodash.\n\n    ```json\n    [\n      { \"option\": \"number of buses\", \"function\": \"grid initialization\", \"dependency\": \"topology\" },\n      { \"option\": \"analysis type\", \"function\": \"power flow solver\", \"dependency\": \"solver type\" }\n    ]\n    ```\n\n**2. Enhanced Reasoning Module in JavaScript:**\n\n* **Few-Shot CoT Prompting:** Guide the LLM's code generation process by providing few-shot examples within the prompt.  Frame the examples to demonstrate function identification, syntax learning, option extraction, and code generation specific to your JavaScript simulation library.\n\n    ```javascript\n    const prompt = `\n    // Example 1: Initialize a grid with 5 buses.\n    // Function: gridInit(numBuses)\n    // Options: { numBuses: 5 }\n    // Code:\n    const grid = gridInit(5);\n\n    // Example 2: Perform a DC power flow.\n    // ...\n\n    // Now, simulate a power grid with 10 buses and perform an OPF analysis.\n    `;\n    ```\n\n\n* **Context Integration:** Inject retrieved information from the knowledge base directly into the prompt using template literals to provide context for code generation.\n\n    ```javascript\n    const retrievedInfo = { numBuses: 10, analysisType: \"OPF\" };\n    const prompt = `\n    Given these options: ${JSON.stringify(retrievedInfo)}, generate the code.\n    `;\n    ```\n\n**3. Environmental Acting Module in JavaScript:**\n\n* **Feedback Loop and Error Handling:** Implement a feedback loop in your JavaScript code. After the LLM generates code, execute it in a sandboxed environment (e.g., using a web worker) and capture any errors. Use the error messages to refine the prompt iteratively. Libraries like `try-catch` blocks are essential for error handling.\n\n    ```javascript\n    try {\n      // Execute LLM-generated code\n      eval(generatedCode);\n    } catch (error) {\n      // Refine the prompt based on the error message\n      newPrompt = `${prompt}\n      The previous code had an error: ${error.message}\n      Please fix it.\n      `;\n      // Send the refined prompt back to the LLM\n    }\n    ```\n\n\n**4. Multi-Agent System Integration (Example with Node.js and Langchain):**\n\nImagine a multi-agent web app where one agent handles user interaction, another retrieves data, and a third generates simulation code. You can orchestrate this using Node.js and libraries like Langchain:\n\n```javascript\n// Using Langchain (Conceptual Example)\nconst { LLMChain, SequentialChain } = require(\"langchain\");\n\n// Chains for each agent (user interaction, retrieval, code generation)\nconst userInteractionChain = ...;\nconst retrievalChain = ...;\nconst codeGenerationChain = ...;\n\n// Sequential chain to orchestrate the agents\nconst overallChain = new SequentialChain({\n  chains: [userInteractionChain, retrievalChain, codeGenerationChain],\n  inputVariables: [\"user_request\"],\n  outputKey: \"simulation_code\",\n});\n\nconst result = await overallChain.call({ user_request: \"Simulate...\" });\nconsole.log(result.simulation_code);\n```\n\n**Key Takeaways for JavaScript Developers:**\n\n* **Modularity:** Design your multi-agent system with clearly defined roles for each agent (e.g., user interaction, retrieval, code generation).\n* **Iterative Refinement:** Embrace the feedback loop and error handling to improve the LLM's performance over time.\n* **Structured Knowledge:** Organize domain-specific knowledge in a way that facilitates efficient retrieval and integration into LLM prompts.\n* **Leverage Existing Tools:** Utilize existing JavaScript frameworks and libraries like Langchain to simplify the development process.\n\n\nBy applying these strategies, JavaScript developers can build powerful and efficient LLM-based multi-agent web applications capable of tackling complex simulation tasks and other intricate functionalities. Remember to experiment and adapt these approaches to your specific use cases and simulation libraries.",
  "pseudocode": "The provided text includes snippets of code that resemble pseudocode but are actually commented-out examples within a larger code structure meant to illustrate the LLM's code generation capabilities.  These snippets are not meant to be functional algorithms in themselves.  Therefore, converting them to fully functional JavaScript would be misrepresenting their purpose in the original text.\n\nHere's why and what they represent:\n\nThe paper discusses a framework to enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform power system simulations using tools like DALINE and MATPOWER.  The \"pseudocode\" examples are placeholders within a larger code generation process.  They represent the *kind* of output the researchers expect the LLM to generate, *not* functioning algorithms.\n\nExample:\n\n```\n# Pseudo case prep\ncase = prep.fakeCase('fake.xyz\nmod fake.Mod (init=x, nf=y)\n# Pseudo options setup\nopts = set.opts(mod, mode='pseudocode')\n# Pseudo task 1: Data generation\ndata = pseudo.gen(case, meth='illusion')\n# Pseudo task 2: Model training\n```\n\nThis snippet demonstrates the *structure* of code the LLM might produce: preparing a case, setting options, generating data, and training a model.  Converting this to JavaScript requires assumptions about the underlying libraries (`prep`, `fake`, `set`, `pseudo`) which are not defined in the paper.  These functions are fictitious placeholders to illustrate the *expected sequence and nature of operations*, not actual function calls.\n\n\nTherefore, while I can create JavaScript that mimics the syntax, it would not reflect the true meaning within the research paper.  Instead of providing potentially misleading JavaScript, I'm indicating that these are not functional pseudocode blocks as understood in typical computer science contexts. They are illustrative examples of expected LLM generated code structure.",
