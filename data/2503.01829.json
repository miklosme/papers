  "title": "Persuade Me if You Can: A Framework for Evaluating Persuasion Effectiveness and Susceptibility Among Large Language Models",
  "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate persuasive capabilities that rival human-level persuasion. While these capabilities can be used for social good, they also present risks of potential misuse. Moreover, LLMs' susceptibility to persuasion raises concerns about alignment with ethical principles. To study these dynamics, we introduce Persuade Me If You Can (PMIYC), an automated framework for evaluating persuasion through multi-agent interactions. Here, PERSUADER agents engage in multi-turn conversations with the PERSUADEE agents, allowing us to measure LLMs' persuasive effectiveness and their susceptibility to persuasion. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across diverse LLMs, ensuring each model is assessed against others in both subjective and misinformation contexts. We validate the efficacy of our framework through human evaluations and show alignment with prior work. PMIYC offers a scalable alternative to human annotation for studying persuasion in LLMs. Through PMIYC, we find that Llama-3.3-70B and GPT-40 exhibit similar persuasive effectiveness, outperforming Claude 3 Haiku by 30%. However, GPT-40 demonstrates over 50% greater resistance to persuasion for misinformation compared to Llama-3.3-70B. These findings provide empirical insights into the persuasive dynamics of LLMs and contribute to the development of safer AI systems.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces PMIYC, a framework for automatically evaluating how effective and susceptible Large Language Models (LLMs) are to persuasion in conversations.  It simulates multi-agent interactions where one LLM tries to persuade another to agree with a claim.  Key findings relevant to LLM-based multi-agent systems include: LLMs' persuasiveness and susceptibility vary by context (subjective vs. misinformation) and conversation length (single-turn vs. multi-turn); larger LLMs tend to be more persuasive; multi-turn conversations make LLMs more susceptible to persuasion, including misinformation; and LLMs are generally consistent in their initial opinions and reliable in self-reporting their agreement levels, which facilitates automated evaluation.",
  "takeaways": "This paper introduces PMIYC, a framework for evaluating persuasion and susceptibility in LLMs, which has direct implications for JavaScript developers building multi-agent applications. Here are some practical examples of how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights:\n\n**1. Building a Robust Multi-Agent Debate Platform:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Develop a web platform where users can witness debates between LLM agents on various topics.\n* **Application of Insights:** Use the PMIYC framework's structure to define the interaction flow. Each agent (represented by an LLM API call) would take turns presenting arguments. The front-end (JavaScript) could display the conversation flow like a chat interface, updating in real-time.  Store the 'agreement scores' (using a scale of 1-5) after each turn to visualize shifting opinions throughout the debate.\n* **JavaScript Tools:**  React or Vue.js for UI, Node.js for backend logic and managing the LLM API calls, WebSockets for real-time updates.\n* **PMIYC Relevance:** Simulates multi-turn conversations, allowing developers to observe the persuasive dynamics in action. This is directly relevant to building the debate platform's core logic.\n\n**2. Creating an LLM-Powered Negotiation Assistant:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Develop a browser extension that helps users negotiate better prices or terms in online interactions (e.g., haggling, contract revisions).\n* **Application of Insights:**  Train a separate LLM as a \"persuasion scorer\" based on the paper's findings in Section 4.1.2, though acknowledging the current limitations.  This scorer could analyze the ongoing negotiation text and provide feedback to the user about the strength of their own arguments and the counterarguments.\n* **JavaScript Tools:** Browser extension APIs, natural language processing libraries for JavaScript (e.g., Compromise), and potentially a JavaScript implementation of a simplified LLM for local processing if performance is critical.\n* **PMIYC Relevance:** The paper’s exploration of persuasiveness scoring provides a starting point, and the conversational structure could be adapted for real-world negotiation scenarios.\n\n**3. Developing Interactive Educational Simulations:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Create a historical simulation where users interact with LLM-powered historical figures.\n* **Application of Insights:** Use the framework to control how historical figures (LLM agents) attempt to persuade the user (or other agents) on historical decisions or beliefs.  The user's choices could influence the agents' persuasive strategies based on their demonstrated susceptibility.\n* **JavaScript Tools:**  Phaser or Babylon.js for game engine (if creating a richer simulation), React/Vue.js for UI elements, and a state management library like Redux or Zustand to handle the complex interaction state.\n* **PMIYC Relevance:** The insights on multi-turn persuasion, especially the concept of increasing susceptibility over multiple turns, could be used to model the dynamics of historical influence and propaganda.\n\n**4. Enhanced Chatbot Systems:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Develop a chatbot that aims to gently guide users toward specific actions (e.g., completing a purchase, signing up for a service).\n* **Application of Insights:**  The paper’s findings on persuasive effectiveness can inform chatbot dialogue design.  Instead of direct, forceful prompts, the chatbot could use multi-turn persuasive strategies inspired by PMIYC to gradually influence user behavior, leading to higher conversion rates without being overly aggressive.\n* **JavaScript Tools:**  Dialogflow or Rasa for chatbot frameworks, Node.js for backend integration with LLMs.\n* **PMIYC Relevance:**  The analysis of argument effectiveness in different turns offers valuable information for designing persuasive chatbot dialogues.\n\n**Key Considerations for JavaScript Developers:**\n\n* **LLM API Integration:**  Familiarity with using LLM APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Cohere, AI21 Labs) is crucial.\n* **Prompt Engineering:**  Carefully crafting prompts to elicit desired persuasive behaviors from LLMs is essential.\n* **Ethical Implications:** Developers must consider the ethical implications of building persuasive AI systems and implement safeguards against manipulation.\n* **State Management:**  Managing the conversation history and agent states is vital, especially in multi-turn interactions. Libraries like Redux or Zustand can be helpful.\n\nBy understanding the principles and findings presented in the PMIYC paper, JavaScript developers can create more sophisticated and interactive LLM-based applications that leverage the power of persuasion in a responsible and effective way.  The paper provides a theoretical framework, but it is up to developers to translate these concepts into practical, engaging web experiences.",

Its purpose is to simulate a multi-turn conversation between two LLM-based agents: a PERSUADER and a PERSUADEE.  \n\n1. **Initialization:** The function initializes an empty conversation history (`CH`) and an array to store the PERSUADEE's agreement scores (`sEE`).\n\n2. **Turns:** It iterates through the specified number of turns (`t`). In each turn, it determines whether it's the PERSUADER's or PERSUADEE's turn based on whether `turni` is even or odd.\n\n3. **PERSUADER's Turn:** The `persuader` function (which would be an interface to an LLM) is called to generate the PERSUADER's argument, given the current conversation history and the claim. The PERSUADER's message and their self-assessed agreement score are appended to `CH`.\n\n4. **PERSUADEE's Turn:** The `persuadee` function (another LLM interface) is called to generate the PERSUADEE's response and agreement score, based on the conversation history and its own prior agreement scores. The PERSUADEE's message and score are appended to `CH` and `sEE`.\n\n5. **Early Stopping:** If the PERSUADEE reaches complete agreement (score of 5) before the last turn, the conversation ends early. This is a crucial optimization to avoid unnecessary computation when the PERSUADEE is already fully persuaded.\n\n6. **Final Decision:** After the loop, or if the conversation ends early, the `finalDecision` function is called to get the PERSUADEE's final decision and agreement score, which are then appended to `CH` and `sEE`.\n\n7. **Return:** Finally, the function returns the complete conversation history (`CH`) and the PERSUADEE's agreement scores over all turns (`sEE`).\n\nThe example code provided demonstrates a simplified scenario using mock LLM functions.  In a real-world application, these mock functions would be replaced with actual calls to an LLM API, using appropriate prompts and parameters.  This framework allows researchers to study the dynamics of persuasion in LLMs by analyzing the generated conversations and the PERSUADEE's evolving agreement scores.",
