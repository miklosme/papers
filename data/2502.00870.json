  "title": "FedHPD: Heterogeneous Federated Reinforcement Learning via Policy Distillation",
  "abstract": "Federated Reinforcement Learning (FedRL) improves sample efficiency while preserving privacy; however, most existing studies assume homogeneous agents, limiting its applicability in real-world scenarios. This paper investigates FedRL in black-box settings with heterogeneous agents, where each agent employs distinct policy networks and training configurations without disclosing their internal details. Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a promising method for facilitating knowledge sharing among heterogeneous models, but it faces challenges related to the scarcity of public datasets and limitations in knowledge representation when applied to FedRL. To address these challenges, we propose Federated Heterogeneous Policy Distillation (FedHPD), which solves the problem of heterogeneous FedRL by utilizing action probability distributions as a medium for knowledge sharing. We provide a theoretical analysis of FedHPD's convergence under standard assumptions. Extensive experiments corroborate that FedHPD shows significant improvements across various reinforcement learning benchmark tasks, further validating our theoretical findings. Moreover, additional experiments demonstrate that FedHPD operates effectively without the need for an elaborate selection of public datasets.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces FedHPD, a new approach to Federated Reinforcement Learning (FedRL) designed for heterogeneous agents (different models and training setups) operating in black-box settings (no shared internal model details). FedHPD uses policy distillation to share knowledge among agents via action probability distributions on a public dataset of states, improving both overall system performance and individual agent learning.  The key points for LLM-based multi-agent systems are that FedHPD offers a method for independently trained LLMs (heterogeneous agents) to collaborate and learn from each other without needing to share their internal workings (black-box) or requiring a centrally managed, shared training environment.  This is accomplished through knowledge distillation utilizing a public dataset of states, a technique adaptable for LLM outputs in various applications.",
  "takeaways": "This paper introduces FedHPD, a method for training heterogeneous multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) systems in a federated manner, particularly relevant for LLM-based agents. Here's how JavaScript developers can apply these insights:\n\n**1. Building Collaborative LLM-based Chatbots:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine developing a customer support system with multiple specialized chatbots (e.g., order processing, technical support, billing). Each chatbot is an LLM-based agent with its own unique architecture and training data (private to each department).  You want them to learn from each other without directly sharing sensitive data or model parameters.\n* **Applying FedHPD:**\n    * **Knowledge Distillation:** Use a shared, public dataset of customer queries (Sp) to extract knowledge from each chatbot.  In JavaScript, this could involve feeding each chatbot the same set of prompts and collecting their response probability distributions.  Libraries like TensorFlow.js can be used to manage these distributions.\n    * **Aggregation:**  Aggregate the individual chatbot distributions into a global consensus distribution on the server. This could be a simple average or a weighted average based on performance metrics.\n    * **Local Updates:** Distribute this global consensus back to each chatbot.  Modify the chatbot training process (e.g., fine-tuning the LLM) to minimize the KL-divergence between its own response distribution and the global consensus, using libraries like TensorFlow.js or a custom implementation.\n* **Benefits:** Improved overall performance and specialization of each chatbot, while preserving data privacy.\n\n**2. Federated Learning for Personalized Web Experiences:**\n\n* **Scenario:** You are developing a personalized content recommendation system for a website. Each user's browser acts as an agent, learning their individual preferences. You want to improve recommendations by leveraging the collective knowledge of all users without collecting sensitive browsing history on a central server.\n* **Applying FedHPD:**\n    * **Knowledge Distillation:** Periodically, select a set of public items (Sp) and have each user's agent (running in the browser using TensorFlow.js or similar) generate a probability distribution over potential actions (e.g., click, save, share) for these items.\n    * **Aggregation and Local Updates:** Aggregate these distributions on the server and distribute the global consensus back to the browsers. Update the agent in each browser (using reinforcement learning techniques) to align its behavior with the global consensus, thus incorporating collective preferences.\n* **Benefits:** Enhanced recommendation quality, increased user engagement, and strong privacy preservation.\n\n**3. Multi-Agent Simulation in the Browser:**\n\n* **Scenario:** You want to simulate a complex system (e.g., traffic flow, market dynamics) with multiple interacting agents in a web-based environment. Each agent has a different role and learning objective.\n* **Applying FedHPD:**  Use FedHPD to facilitate learning and coordination among the agents.  The public state set (Sp) could be a set of representative scenarios in the simulation. Libraries like Web Workers can enable parallel agent training in the browser.  Three.js or Babylon.js can handle the visualization of the simulation.\n* **Benefits:**  More realistic simulations, emergent behavior from agent interactions, potential for distributed computation across multiple user browsers.\n\n**JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries:**\n\n* **TensorFlow.js:** For managing probability distributions, calculating KL-divergence, and implementing reinforcement learning algorithms in the browser.\n* **Web Workers:** For parallel processing of multiple agents in browser-based simulations.\n* **Node.js and Express:** For building the server-side logic for aggregation and distribution of knowledge.\n* **Three.js/Babylon.js:**  For visualizing multi-agent simulations.\n\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n\n* **Distillation Interval (d):**  Experiment with different values of 'd' to find the right balance between communication cost and performance improvement.\n* **Heterogeneity:** Embrace the heterogeneity of LLM architectures and training configurations. FedHPD allows for this diversity, which can lead to richer solutions.\n* **Public State Set (Sp):**  Careful selection of Sp can improve generalization and efficiency.  This set should be representative of the relevant problem domain.\n\nBy leveraging these concepts and tools, JavaScript developers can unlock the potential of FedHPD to build powerful and privacy-preserving LLM-based multi-agent applications for the web.",

It aims to improve both system-level and individual agent performance.\n\n1. **Local Training:** Each agent trains independently using its own data and policy network.  The specific RL algorithm used for local training can be chosen based on the task (e.g., REINFORCE, PPO, A2C, etc.).  The provided code uses REINFORCE as an example and includes placeholder functions `calculatePolicyGradient` and  `trainAgentLocally` which would contain the actual implementation.\n\n2. **Collaborative Training (Knowledge Distillation):**  Every `d` rounds, the agents engage in collaborative training through knowledge distillation.  This involves:\n    * **Get Probability Distributions:** Each agent computes the action probability distributions over the public state set `Sp` using its current policy.\n    * **Knowledge Aggregation:**  The server aggregates these distributions (e.g., by averaging) to create a global consensus distribution.\n    * **Knowledge Digestion:**  Each agent receives the global consensus distribution and calculates the KL divergence between its own distribution and the global consensus. It then updates its policy based on this divergence, effectively incorporating knowledge from other agents without directly sharing their model parameters.\n\n**Key improvements over traditional FedRL:**\n\n* **Handles Heterogeneity:**  Allows agents with different network architectures and training configurations to learn from each other.\n* **Preserves Privacy:** Agents do not share their model parameters, only action probability distributions over a public state set.\n* **Improved Sample Efficiency:** Knowledge distillation helps agents learn more efficiently by leveraging information from other agents.\n\n\nThe placeholder functions in the JavaScript code need to be replaced with specific implementations according to the chosen RL algorithm, environment, and policy representation. This structure provides a flexible framework for experimenting with FedHPD in various settings.",
