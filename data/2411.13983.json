  "title": "Learning Two-agent Motion Planning Strategies from Generalized Nash Equilibrium for Model Predictive Control",
  "abstract": "We introduce an Implicit Game-Theoretic MPC (IGT-MPC), a decentralized algorithm for two-agent motion planning that uses a learned value function that predicts the game-theoretic interaction outcomes as the terminal cost-to-go function in a model predictive control (MPC) framework, guiding agents to implicitly account for interactions with other agents and maximize their reward. This approach applies to competitive and cooperative multi-agent motion planning problems which we formulate as constrained dynamic games. Given a constrained dynamic game, we randomly sample initial conditions and solve for the generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) to generate a dataset of GNE solutions, computing the reward outcome of each game-theoretic interaction from the GNE. The data is used to train a simple neural network to predict the reward outcome, which we use as the terminal cost-to-go function in an MPC scheme. We showcase emerging competitive and coordinated behaviors using IGT-MPC in scenarios such as two-vehicle head-to-head racing and un-signalized intersection navigation. IGT-MPC offers a novel method integrating machine learning and game-theoretic reasoning into model-based decentralized multi-agent motion planning.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces IGT-MPC, a decentralized algorithm for two-agent motion planning. It uses a learned value function, trained on the outcomes of game-theoretic interactions (Generalized Nash Equilibria), within a Model Predictive Control framework. This allows agents to implicitly consider other agents' actions and maximize their own rewards without complex real-time game-theoretic calculations.\n\nKey points for LLM-based multi-agent systems: IGT-MPC demonstrates a way to combine learned strategic behavior with traditional control methods.  This could be relevant for LLMs by offering a structured approach to integrate learned cooperative and competitive strategies, potentially improving performance and stability in multi-agent scenarios, especially when explicit modeling of agent interactions is difficult. The reward learning aspect could be particularly useful for training LLM-based agents to achieve specific collaborative or competitive objectives.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents IGT-MPC, a method for decentralized multi-agent motion planning using learned value functions derived from game theory.  While the paper focuses on autonomous vehicle scenarios, the core concepts translate well to other web development applications involving LLMs and multi-agent interactions.  Here are some practical examples for a JavaScript developer:\n\n**1. Collaborative Content Creation:**\n\nImagine a web app where multiple LLM agents collaboratively write a story. Each agent has its own style and preferences (represented as a cost function).  Instead of explicitly modeling each agent's behavior, you can apply IGT-MPC:\n\n* **Offline Training:**  Create a dataset by simulating story creation scenarios.  For each scenario, generate different story beginnings and have the LLMs complete the stories.  Record the overall story quality (reward) based on human evaluation or automated metrics (e.g., coherence, creativity). This forms your training dataset (X, Y).\n* **Value Function Learning:** Use TensorFlow.js or Brain.js to train a neural network (VGT) that predicts story quality given the current state (e.g., the last few sentences) and the agents' planned next sentences.\n* **Online Story Generation:** Integrate VGT into the real-time story generation process. Each agent uses its own MPC controller. Within its MPC optimization, each agent considers its local objective and the predicted story quality (VGT output) to determine its next sentence.  This allows agents to implicitly coordinate without explicit communication, leading to higher overall quality stories.\n\n**2. Multi-Agent Chatbots for Customer Service:**\n\nConsider a website where multiple chatbot agents handle different aspects of customer queries (e.g., order status, technical support, billing).\n\n* **Offline Training:** Create simulated customer interaction scenarios with varying query types and agent specializations. Record the success rate of each interaction (reward), such as resolving the query within a certain time and customer satisfaction.\n* **Value Function Learning:** Train a VGT that predicts interaction success based on the current dialogue state and the agents' planned responses.\n* **Online Interaction:** During a live chat, each chatbot agent uses its MPC controller and the learned VGT to generate responses, implicitly coordinating handoffs and ensuring the customer is routed to the most appropriate agent, leading to improved efficiency and customer satisfaction.\n\n**3. Decentralized Resource Management in Online Games:**\n\nIn a multiplayer online game, multiple agents might compete for limited resources (e.g., gathering materials, controlling territory).\n\n* **Offline Training:** Simulate game scenarios with varying resource distributions and agent starting positions. Record the resources gathered or territory controlled by each agent (reward).\n* **Value Function Learning:** Train a VGT to predict agent performance given the game state and planned actions.\n* **Online Gameplay:** Integrate VGT into each agent's decision-making process. Each agent's MPC controller uses the learned value function to choose actions, implicitly anticipating the moves of other agents and optimizing for individual gain while maintaining overall game balance.\n\n**JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries:**\n\n* **TensorFlow.js/Brain.js:** For training and deploying the value function neural network.\n* **Web Workers:** For parallelizing agent computations in the browser.\n* **Socket.IO/WebRTC:** For communication between agents if required (though IGT-MPC aims to minimize explicit communication).\n* **Three.js/Babylon.js:**  For visualization of agent interactions, particularly in game scenarios.\n\n\nBy applying these techniques, JavaScript developers can build more sophisticated and robust multi-agent systems that leverage the power of LLMs while avoiding the complexity of explicit coordination modeling. The paper's key contribution is the ability to \"bake\" strategic thinking into the agents through the learned value function, leading to more intelligent and collaborative behavior.",

It takes the learned value function (`vgt`), the task horizon (`taskHorizon`), and a `forecastFunction` (to predict other agents' trajectories) as inputs.  Inside the loop, it:\n   - Gets forecasts of other agents' actions.\n   - Constructs the feature vector `xt_plus_n`.\n   - Calls the learned value function (`vgt`) to get the terminal cost.\n   - Calls the `mpc` function to solve the optimization problem and obtain the control input `u`.\n   - Applies the control `u` to the system.\n\n2. **`mpc(currentState, otherAgentForecasts, valueFunction)`:** This function implements the Model Predictive Control component.  It uses CasADi, a symbolic framework for optimization, to formulate and solve the FHOCP (Finite Horizon Optimal Control Problem). The key steps are:\n   - Defining decision variables (control inputs over the horizon).\n   - Defining constraints (dynamics, state/input limits, collision avoidance). The collision avoidance is simplified using circular obstacles and distance constraints.\n   - Defining the cost function, which includes the stage cost and the terminal cost obtained from the learned value function `valueFunction`.\n   - Setting up and solving the optimization problem using IPOPT.\n\n\n**Purpose:**\n\nThe IGT-MPC algorithm aims to solve multi-agent motion planning problems by integrating learned game-theoretic knowledge into a model-based control framework.  It learns a value function that predicts the outcomes of game-theoretic interactions and uses this value function as the terminal cost in an MPC formulation. This allows the agents to implicitly consider the strategic interactions with other agents without the need for explicit game-theoretic computations at each control step, making it more suitable for real-time applications. The code provides a practical way for JavaScript developers to experiment with the concepts presented in the paper, adapting it to their specific multi-agent scenarios and dynamics. Note: The provided JavaScript code is a more detailed and complete implementation of Algorithm 1. It includes essential components like constraint handling, cost function definition, and solver setup using CasADi, which are necessary for a functioning MPC controller.",
