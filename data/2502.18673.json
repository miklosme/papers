  "title": "Scaffolding Empathy: Training Counselors with Simulated Patients and Utterance-level Performance Visualizations",
  "abstract": "Learning therapeutic counseling involves significant role-play experience with mock patients, with current manual training methods providing only intermittent granular feedback. We seek to accelerate and optimize counselor training by providing frequent, detailed feedback to trainees as they interact with a simulated patient. Our first application domain involves training motivational interviewing skills for counselors. Motivational interviewing is a collaborative counseling style in which patients are guided to talk about changing their behavior, with empathetic counseling an essential ingredient. We developed and evaluated an LLM-powered training system that features a simulated patient and visualizations of turn-by-turn performance feedback tailored to the needs of counselors learning motivational interviewing. We conducted an evaluation study with professional and student counselors, demonstrating high usability and satisfaction with the system. We present design implications for the development of automated systems that train users in counseling skills and their generalizability to other types of social skills training.",
  "summary": "This paper presents SimPatient, an LLM-powered training system for counselors learning motivational interviewing (MI). It uses a multi-agent architecture where different LLMs handle simulated patient responses, behavior coding, dynamic cognitive factor modeling, and post-session feedback generation.\n\nKey points for LLM-based multi-agent systems include: specialized prompting for different agent roles, chain-of-thought prompting for generating explanations, and challenges in simulating resistant patient behaviors and nuanced personas with LLMs.  The dynamic cognitive model driven by a dedicated LLM agent offers valuable insights into training by simulating the impact of counselor actions on patient internal states.  The system shows promise as an effective training tool, improving MI self-efficacy and garnering positive user feedback.  However, further research is needed to address LLM limitations, including positivity bias and persona fidelity, and to incorporate more robust validation methods.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents exciting opportunities for JavaScript developers working with LLM-based multi-agent applications, especially in simulating complex human behavior for training or educational purposes. Here are some practical examples leveraging its insights:\n\n**1. Building a SimPatient-like system for other domains:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Create a training simulation for customer service representatives handling complex or emotionally charged situations.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * **LLM Agents (e.g., LangChain, Transformers.js):** One agent acts as the simulated customer with a defined persona and emotional model (like SimPatient's cognitive factors). Another agent evaluates the representative's responses based on pre-defined criteria (e.g., empathy, active listening, problem-solving).  A third agent could dynamically adjust the customer's emotional state based on the representative's actions.\n    * **Frontend (e.g., React, Vue.js):** Develop a chat interface for interaction with the simulated customer. Integrate text-to-speech for a more immersive experience.\n    * **Backend (e.g., Node.js, Express.js):** Manage the interaction between the LLM agents and store conversation history.\n    * **Evaluation Dashboard (e.g., Chart.js, D3.js):** Visualize key metrics like empathy scores, customer satisfaction, and the dynamic emotional model of the simulated customer. Include transcribed conversation with agent justifications for feedback.\n\n**2. Enhancing existing LLM-based chatbots with dynamic emotional models:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Improve a customer support chatbot by making it more responsive to user emotions.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * **Emotional Model:** Implement a simplified version of SimPatient's cognitive factors (e.g., frustration, satisfaction) within your JavaScript chatbot application.\n    * **LLM Agent (e.g., LangChain):** Use an LLM to analyze user input and update the emotional model accordingly. Train the LLM with a dataset of user utterances and their corresponding emotional impact.\n    * **Response Generation:** Modify the chatbot's response generation based on the current emotional state. For example, if the user's frustration is high, the chatbot could offer to connect them to a human agent.\n\n**3. Creating interactive educational simulations:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Develop a historical simulation where users interact with LLM-powered historical figures.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * **LLM Agents:** Each historical figure is represented by an LLM agent with a persona based on historical knowledge. The agents interact with the user and each other, creating a dynamic historical narrative.\n    * **Frontend (e.g., React with Three.js):**  A visually rich environment could present the historical setting.  User interaction would be through a dialog system.\n    * **Evaluation:** Use LLM agents to evaluate user choices based on historical accuracy or alignment with specific historical figures' viewpoints.  Provide feedback through in-world consequences or a post-session summary.\n\n**4. Experimenting with multi-agent communication and coordination:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Develop a collaborative writing tool where multiple LLM agents work together to create a story.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * **LLM Agents:** Each agent specializes in a different aspect of storytelling (e.g., plot, character development, dialogue).  \n    * **Communication Protocol (e.g., JSON):** Design a clear protocol for agents to communicate their ideas, critique each other's work, and negotiate changes.\n    * **Frontend (e.g., React):** Allow the user to observe the agents' interactions and intervene when necessary.\n\n**Key JavaScript Libraries and Frameworks:**\n\n* **LLM Interaction:** LangChain, Transformers.js\n* **Frontend:** React, Vue.js, Three.js\n* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js\n* **Visualization:** Chart.js, D3.js\n* **State Management:** Redux, Vuex\n\nBy combining the insights from this paper with readily available JavaScript tools, developers can create compelling and impactful LLM-based multi-agent applications.  Remember to address the ethical considerations of using LLMs, particularly regarding bias and ensuring responsible use of these powerful technologies.",
