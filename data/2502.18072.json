  "title": "MRBTP: Efficient Multi-Robot Behavior Tree Planning and Collaboration",
  "abstract": "Multi-robot task planning and collaboration are critical challenges in robotics. While Behavior Trees (BTs) have been established as a popular control architecture and are plannable for a single robot, the development of effective multi-robot BT planning algorithms remains challenging due to the complexity of coordinating diverse action spaces. We propose the Multi-Robot Behavior Tree Planning (MRBTP) algorithm, with theoretical guarantees of both soundness and completeness. MRBTP features cross-tree expansion to coordinate heterogeneous actions across different BTs to achieve the team's goal. For homogeneous actions, we retain backup structures among BTs to ensure robustness and prevent redundant execution through intention sharing. While MRBTP is capable of generating BTs for both homogeneous and heterogeneous robot teams, its efficiency can be further improved. We then propose an optional plugin for MRBTP when Large Language Models (LLMs) are available to reason goal-related actions for each robot. These relevant actions can be pre-planned to form long-horizon subtrees, significantly enhancing the planning speed and collaboration efficiency of MRBTP. We evaluate our algorithm in warehouse management and everyday service scenarios. Results demonstrate MRBTP's robustness and execution efficiency under varying settings, as well as the ability of the pre-trained LLM to generate effective task-specific subtrees for MRBTP.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces MRBTP, a new algorithm for coordinating multiple robots using Behavior Trees (BTs). It addresses challenges like coordinating diverse robot actions and avoiding redundant work.  Crucially for LLM-based systems, MRBTP offers a plugin where an LLM can pre-plan \"subtrees\" of actions, effectively suggesting larger-scale strategies for each robot. This accelerates planning and improves teamwork by reducing the need for constant communication during execution.  The LLM interacts through a structured JSON format, receiving feedback to refine its suggested subtrees.  Experiments show improved efficiency and robustness, particularly when the LLM-generated subtrees and inter-robot communication are combined.",
  "takeaways": "This research paper presents MRBTP, a novel algorithm for planning and coordinating behavior trees (BTs) in multi-agent robotic systems. Let's explore how these concepts can be applied to LLM-based multi-agent web applications by a JavaScript developer.\n\n**Practical Examples for JavaScript Developers**\n\nImagine building a collaborative web application, like a shared document editor with multiple users interacting simultaneously, or a real-time strategy game in the browser. Each user or game entity can be considered an agent.  Here's how MRBTP principles can be applied:\n\n**1. Cross-Tree Expansion (Collaboration):**\n\n* **Scenario:** In the shared document editor, one user (Agent A) wants to insert an image, but needs another user (Agent B) to upload it first.\n* **Implementation:**\n    *  Each agent has a BT managing its actions (e.g., `insertImage`, `uploadImage`, `writeText`).\n    *  Agent A's BT has a condition `imageUploaded` which is currently false.\n    *  Using a message queue (e.g., Socket.IO, Redis pub/sub), Agent A broadcasts the condition `imageUploaded` as pending.\n    * Agent B's BT, listening on the queue, recognizes this pending condition and adds an action `uploadImage` to its BT to fulfill Agent A's requirement.\n    * Once Agent B uploads, it broadcasts a message. Agent Aâ€™s BT now ticks the condition `imageUploaded`, now `true`, and proceeds with `insertImage`.\n* **JavaScript Code Example (Conceptual):**\n\n```javascript\n// Agent A\nsocket.emit('conditionPending', 'imageUploaded'); \n\nsocket.on('imageUploaded', () => {\n  this.behaviorTree.tick(); // Resume execution\n});\n\n\n// Agent B\nsocket.on('conditionPending', (condition) => {\n  if (condition === 'imageUploaded' && this.canUpload()) {\n    this.behaviorTree.addNode('uploadImage'); // Add upload action\n    this.behaviorTree.tick();\n  }\n});\n\n// Simplified Behavior Tree implementation\nclass BehaviorTree {\n    // ... implementation\n    tick(){\n        //traverse the tree and execute actions based on conditions\n    }\n    addNode(){\n        //add actions/conditions to the tree\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\n**2. Intention Sharing (Efficiency and Fault Tolerance):**\n\n* **Scenario:**  In the real-time strategy game, multiple units (agents) can harvest resources from the same source.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * Each unit has a BT with actions like `moveToResource`, `harvestResource`.\n    * Before executing `moveToResource`, a unit broadcasts its intention.\n    * Other units, observing this, can choose to target different resource locations, avoiding collisions and maximizing parallel resource gathering.\n    * If a unit fails to harvest (e.g., disconnects), another unit can see the unmet intention and take over.\n* **JavaScript Code Example (Conceptual):**\n\n```javascript\n// Agent\nsocket.emit('intention', { action: 'harvestResource', target: 'resource1' });\n\nsocket.on('intention', (data) => {\n  if (data.action === 'harvestResource' && data.target === this.targetResource) {\n    this.findAlternativeResource(); // Find a different resource\n  }\n});\n```\n\n**3. Subtree Pre-planning (LLM Integration):**\n\n* **Scenario:** In a complex web application, the overall goal can be broken down into sub-goals (e.g., \"book a flight\" -> \"search flights\", \"select flight\", \"enter passenger details\", \"make payment\").\n* **Implementation:**\n     * Use an LLM (via API) to suggest these sub-goals based on the user's high-level request and generate subtree structures for the BTs of different agents involved in the process (e.g., flight search agent, booking agent, payment gateway agent).\n     *  This improves planning speed as the subtrees are already pre-calculated for common tasks.\n* **JavaScript Code Example (Conceptual):**\n\n```javascript\nconst prompt = `User wants to book a flight from London to New York on 2024-12-25.`;\nconst llmResponse = await callLLMAPI(prompt);  // Get subtree suggestions from LLM\n\n// Parse and incorporate subtrees into the agent's BT\nconst subtree = llmResponse.subtrees['flightSearchAgent'];\nthis.behaviorTree.addSubtree(subtree);\n```\n\n**Relevant JavaScript Frameworks/Libraries:**\n\n* **Behavior Tree Libraries:**  While dedicated BT libraries are less common in JS, there are general-purpose state machine or finite-state machine libraries (e.g., `javascript-state-machine`, `machina.js`) that can be adapted to implement BT structures.\n* **Messaging/Coordination:** Socket.IO, Redis pub/sub, or WebRTC data channels can be utilized for inter-agent communication and intention sharing.\n* **LLM Integration:**  Various client-side libraries or API wrappers facilitate interacting with LLM services.\n\n\nBy integrating the principles of MRBTP, combined with the power of LLMs and existing JavaScript technologies, web developers can create truly collaborative, efficient, and robust multi-agent applications.  This opens up exciting new possibilities for advanced web experiences that were not previously possible.",
  "pseudocode": "The following JavaScript code snippets correspond to the pseudocode algorithms presented in the paper:\n\n**Algorithm 1: One-step cross-tree expansion**\n\n```javascript\nfunction expandOneRobot(T, A, c) {\n  let Tnew = { type: 'condition', condition: c }; // Newly expanded subtree\n  let Cnew = new Set(); // Newly expanded conditions\n\n  for (let a of A) {\n    // Check if action 'a' can lead to condition 'c' and doesn't delete 'c'\n    if (intersection(c, union(a.preconditions, subtract(a.addEffects, a.deleteEffects))) && isSubset(c, subtract(c, a.deleteEffects))) {\n      let ca = union(a.preconditions, subtract(c, a.addEffects));\n      let Ta = { type: 'sequence', children: [ca, a] };\n      Tnew = { type: 'fallback', children: [...Tnew.children || [Tnew], Ta] };\n      Cnew.add(ca);\n    }\n  }\n\n  if (Cnew.size > 0) {\n    if (conditionInTree(c, T)) {\n      // In-tree expansion: Replace 'c' with 'Tnew' in 'T'\n      replaceConditionInTree(c, Tnew, T); \n    } else if (Tnew.type !== 'condition' || Tnew.condition !== c) {\n      // Cross-tree expansion: Add 'Tnew' to 'T'\n      T = { type: 'fallback', children: [...T.children || [T], Tnew] };\n    }\n  }\n  return [T, Cnew];\n}\n\n\n// Helper functions (replace with your actual implementations)\nfunction intersection(setA, setB) { /* ... */ }\nfunction union(setA, setB) { /* ... */ }\nfunction subtract(setA, setB) { /* ... */ }\nfunction isSubset(setA, setB) { /* ... */ }\nfunction conditionInTree(condition, tree) { /* ... */ }\nfunction replaceConditionInTree(oldCondition, newSubtree, tree) { /* ... */ }\n\n```\n*Explanation*: This algorithm expands the behavior tree (BT) of a single robot by one step, considering a specific condition `c`.  It iterates through the robot's available actions (`A`) and checks if an action can achieve or contribute to achieving  `c`. If so, it creates a new subtree (`Tnew`) that incorporates the action and its preconditions. The algorithm handles two cases: *in-tree expansion*, where `c` already exists in the tree and is replaced by the new subtree, and *cross-tree expansion*, where `c` is added as a new branch. The function returns the modified BT and a set of newly expanded conditions.\n\n**Algorithm 2: MRBTP**\n\n```javascript\nfunction MRBTP(S, L, A, M, s0, g) {\n  let Cu = new Set([g]); // Conditions to be explored\n  let Ce = new Set(); // Expanded conditions\n  let T = [];  // Initialize BTs for each robot\n  for (let i = 0; i < A.length; i++) {\n      T[i] = { type: 'fallback', children: [g] };\n  }\n\n  while (Cu.size > 0) {\n    let c = Cu.values().next().value;\n    Cu.delete(c);\n\n    if (hasSubset(c, Ce)) continue; // Prune already explored conditions\n\n    let Cnew_all = new Set();\n    for (let i = 0; i < A.length; i++) {\n      let [Ti_new, Cnew] = expandOneRobot(T[i], A[i], c);\n      T[i] = Ti_new;\n      Cnew.forEach(cond => Cnew_all.add(cond));\n    }\n\n\n    if (hasSubset(s0, Cnew_all)) {\n        return T; // Return a solution\n    }\n\n    Cnew_all.forEach(cond => {\n        Ce.add(cond);\n        Cu.add(cond);\n    });\n  }\n  return \"Unsolvable\";\n}\n\n\n// Helper functions (replace with your actual implementations)\nfunction hasSubset(setA, setB) {  /* Returns true if any element of SetA is a subset of SetB */ }\n```\n\n*Explanation*: This is the main multi-robot behavior tree planning (MRBTP) algorithm. It takes the initial state (`s0`), the goal condition (`g`), a list of action spaces for each robot (`A`), and other relevant information as input. It initializes the BTs for each robot with the goal condition and then iteratively expands them using the `expandOneRobot` function. It maintains two sets: `Cu` (conditions to be explored) and `Ce` (expanded conditions). The algorithm prunes branches if the current condition has already been explored and returns a solution if the initial state satisfies any newly expanded condition.  It returns \"Unsolvable\" if it exhausts all possible expansions without finding a solution.\n\nThese JavaScript implementations provide a starting point for experimenting with MRBTP in web applications.  Remember to replace the placeholder helper functions with your concrete implementations based on your specific domain and data structures.  The provided code focuses on the core algorithm structure and may require further adaptation for integration into a fully functional web application.",
