  "title": "LIVENET: Robust, Minimally Invasive Multi-Robot Control for Safe and Live Navigation in Constrained Environments",
  "abstract": "Robots in densely populated real-world environments frequently encounter constrained and cluttered situations such as passing through narrow doorways, hallways, and corridor intersections, where conflicts over limited space result in collisions or deadlocks among the robots. Current decentralized state-of-the-art optimization- and neural network-based approaches (i) are predominantly designed for general open spaces, and (ii) are overly conservative, either guaranteeing safety, or liveness, but not both. While some solutions rely on centralized conflict resolution, their highly invasive trajectories make them impractical for real-world deployment. This paper introduces LIVENET, a fully decentralized and robust neural network controller that enables human-like yielding and passing, resulting in agile, non-conservative, deadlock-free, and safe, navigation in congested, conflict-prone spaces. LIVENET is minimally invasive, without requiring inter-agent communication or cooperative behavior. The key insight behind LIVENET is a unified CBF formulation for simultaneous safety and liveness, which we integrate within a neural network for robustness. We evaluated LIVENET in simulation and found that general multi-robot optimization- and learning-based navigation methods fail to even reach the goal, and while methods designed specially for such environments do succeed, they are 10-20× slower, 4-5× more invasive, and much less robust to variations in the scenario configuration such as changes in the start states and goal states, among others. We open-source the LIVENET code at https://github.com/srikarg89/LiveNet.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces LIVENET, a decentralized neural network controller for navigating multiple robots in confined spaces, like doorways and intersections, without collisions or deadlocks.  It emphasizes simultaneous safety and liveness, mimicking human-like yielding behavior.\n\n\nKey points for LLM-based multi-agent systems:\n\n* **Decentralized control:** Each agent operates independently based on local observations, mirroring the distributed nature of many LLM agents.\n* **Safety and liveness guarantees:**  LIVENET formally addresses both collision avoidance (safety) and progress towards goals (liveness), crucial for robust multi-agent applications.\n* **Minimally invasive control:**  Agents adjust speed rather than trajectory for conflict resolution, promoting smooth and efficient interactions in collaborative LLM agent scenarios.\n* **Robustness:** LIVENET handles variations in environment and agent configurations, a desirable trait for LLM agents deployed in diverse, dynamic contexts.\n* **Potential for end-to-end training:** The neural network architecture could be adapted for end-to-end training with LLMs, potentially enabling more complex and adaptive behaviors in multi-agent settings.\n* **Relevance of CBFs:** The use of Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) provides a mathematically sound framework for ensuring safety and liveness, applicable to various LLM agent control problems.",
  "takeaways": "This paper introduces LIVENET, a novel approach for coordinating multiple agents in constrained environments, ensuring both safety (collision avoidance) and liveness (progress towards goals). Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights to LLM-based multi-agent AI projects, specifically in web development:\n\n**1. Collaborative Web Editing with LLMs:**\n\nImagine a collaborative document editor where multiple LLMs act as agents, each responsible for generating or refining different parts of the text. LIVENET's principles can be applied to prevent conflicts, such as two LLMs simultaneously editing the same paragraph.\n\n* **Scenario:** Multiple users are collaborating on a marketing campaign using an LLM-powered editor.  Each LLM agent, representing a user, proposes different ad copy variations.\n* **LIVENET Application:** Implement a conflict resolution mechanism inspired by LIVENET's CBFs.  If two LLMs attempt to modify the same section, a \"liveness\" CBF can determine which LLM gets priority based on factors like edit history, user roles, or even a negotiation process between the LLMs.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** Use a library like Yjs or ProseMirror for collaborative editing and implement a custom conflict resolution strategy based on LIVENET. Socket.IO could be used for real-time communication between agents.\n\n**2. Multi-Agent Chatbots for Customer Service:**\n\nIn a customer service scenario, multiple specialized chatbots (LLMs) can handle different aspects of a customer's query. LIVENET can ensure smooth handoff between agents without interrupting the user experience.\n\n* **Scenario:** A customer contacts support regarding a complex technical issue. A general chatbot engages initially, then passes the conversation to specialized bots for troubleshooting, billing, and account management as needed.\n* **LIVENET Application:** Model the interaction as a constrained environment, where agents need to \"occupy\" the conversation space without overlapping. Implement \"liveness\" CBFs to manage these handoffs based on keywords detected in the user's input and the chatbot's expertise.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** Use a chatbot framework like Botpress or Rasa. Extend it with custom logic to implement LIVENET's agent coordination principles.\n\n**3. LLM-Powered Game Development:**\n\nIn online multi-player games, LIVENET can coordinate multiple LLM-controlled Non-Player Characters (NPCs) in a dynamic environment.\n\n* **Scenario:** A strategy game where LLM-controlled NPCs manage resources, build structures, and engage in combat.\n* **LIVENET Application:** Use \"safety\" CBFs to prevent NPCs from colliding or interfering with each other's actions. \"Liveness\" CBFs ensure that NPCs continue making progress towards their individual or collective goals, even in congested areas of the game map.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** Leverage a game engine like Phaser or Babylon.js.  Integrate LLM interaction through APIs and implement LIVENET's coordination logic as part of the game's AI system.\n\n**4. Decentralized Autonomous Agents in Virtual Worlds:**\n\nImagine a metaverse-like environment populated by LLM-controlled avatars. LIVENET can coordinate their interactions, preventing collisions and deadlocks while enabling complex social interactions.\n\n* **Scenario:** A virtual conference where LLM-powered avatars representing real attendees network and participate in sessions.\n* **LIVENET Application:**  Use \"safety\" CBFs to implement spatial awareness and prevent avatar collisions.  \"Liveness\" CBFs can manage access to limited resources (like virtual seats in a presentation hall) or prioritize certain interactions based on social cues.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** Three.js or other web-based 3D graphics libraries can be used for rendering the environment.  LLM interaction can be integrated through APIs and LIVENET's coordination principles implemented as part of the avatar's control logic.\n\n\n**Key JavaScript Concepts and Libraries:**\n\n* **Control Barrier Functions (CBFs):**  Represent these as JavaScript functions that take agent states as input and output a safety/liveness score.\n* **Quadratic Programming (QP):**  Use a JavaScript QP solver (if available) or implement a simplified version for real-time performance.\n* **Neural Networks:** Consider using TensorFlow.js to implement the neural network components of LIVENET.\n* **Real-time Communication:** Socket.IO is useful for implementing communication between agents in real-time collaborative scenarios.\n\n\nBy adapting LIVENET's core principles, JavaScript developers can enhance the robustness and efficiency of LLM-based multi-agent systems, opening up exciting possibilities for interactive and intelligent web applications. Remember to focus on practical implementations, simplifying where needed to balance theoretical rigor with real-time performance in web environments.",
