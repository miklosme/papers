  "title": "DeepFund: Will LLM be Professional at Fund Investment? A Live Arena Perspective",
  "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various domains, but their effectiveness in financial decision-making—particularly in fund investment—remains inadequately evaluated. Current benchmarks primarily assess LLMs' understanding of financial documents rather than their ability to manage assets or analyze trading opportunities in dynamic market conditions. A critical limitation in existing evaluation methodologies is the backtesting approach, which suffers from information leakage when LLMs are evaluated on historical data they may have encountered during pre-training. This paper introduces DeepFund, a comprehensive arena platform for evaluating LLM-based trading strategies in a simulated live environment. Our approach implements a multi-agent framework where LLMs serve as both analysts and managers, creating a realistic simulation of investment decision processes. The platform employs a forward-testing methodology that mitigates information leakage by evaluating models on market data that becomes available after their training cutoff dates. We provide a web interface that visualizes model performance across different market conditions and investment parameters, enabling detailed comparative analysis. Through DeepFund, we aim to provide a more accurate and fair assessment of LLMs' capabilities in fund investment, offering insights into their potential real-world applications in financial markets.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces DeepFund, a platform for evaluating how well large language models (LLMs) can make financial investment decisions.  It argues current benchmarks are flawed due to data leakage (LLMs being tested on historical data they've already seen), a focus on theory over practice, too much human intervention, and difficulty maintaining up-to-date data. DeepFund uses a multi-agent system where different LLMs act as analysts (technical, fundamental, insider, media) and managers, making decisions in a simulated live trading environment with forward-testing (using data the models haven't been trained on).  This allows for more realistic and rigorous evaluation of LLM-based trading strategies.",
  "takeaways": "This paper introduces DeepFund, a platform for evaluating LLM-based financial trading agents in a simulated live environment.  Let's explore how JavaScript developers can apply these insights to their multi-agent AI projects, focusing on web development scenarios:\n\n**1. Forward-Testing Evaluation in a Simulated Environment:**\n\n* **Concept:** DeepFund emphasizes forward-testing to avoid data leakage. This means evaluating agents on data they haven't been trained on, mimicking real-world scenarios.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * Create a simulated environment using Node.js. This environment could be a simplified model of a market or a game.\n    * Use a time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB, TimescaleDB) to store market data and make it accessible chronologically.\n    * Develop a JavaScript module to manage the simulation clock and release data to the agents incrementally.\n    * Use a frontend JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Vue, Svelte) to visualize the simulation environment and agent performance.\n\n**2. Multi-Agent Architecture:**\n\n* **Concept:** DeepFund uses a multi-agent system with specialized agents (Analyst, Planner, Manager).  JavaScript developers can adapt this to other domains.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * Design each agent as a JavaScript class or module.\n    * Use a message broker (e.g., Redis, RabbitMQ) or a library like `node-ipc` for inter-agent communication.  Consider WebSockets for real-time communication if needed.\n    * Implement different \"Analyst\" agents using LLMs accessed via APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Langchain).  Specialize each analyst (e.g., sentiment analysis, technical indicator analysis).\n    * The \"Planner\" agent (JavaScript logic) could assign tasks to analysts based on market conditions or other criteria.\n    * The \"Manager\" agent (JavaScript logic) would consolidate the analysts' outputs and make decisions.\n\n**3. Model Integration and Standardized Interface:**\n\n* **Concept:** DeepFund aims for easy integration of different LLMs.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * Create an abstract JavaScript class or interface for LLMs.\n    * Implement adapter classes for specific LLM providers (e.g., OpenAIAdapter, HuggingFaceAdapter).  This allows swapping LLMs without rewriting core agent logic.\n    * Standardize the input/output formats for the LLMs using JSON or a similar format.\n\n**4. Performance Monitoring and Visualization:**\n\n* **Concept:** Visualizing agent behavior and performance is crucial for understanding and improvement.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * Log agent actions, decisions, and performance metrics to a database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL).\n    * Use charting libraries (e.g., Chart.js, D3.js) to create interactive dashboards in the frontend.\n    * Visualize the simulation environment, agent interactions, and market data using a JavaScript game engine (e.g., Phaser, Babylon.js) if suitable for the project.\n\n**Example Scenario: Multi-Agent Customer Support Chatbot:**\n\nImagine building a customer support chatbot system using multiple specialized LLM agents.  One agent handles order inquiries, another manages technical issues, and a third deals with complaints. A \"Planner\" agent could route incoming messages based on keywords or sentiment analysis. A \"Manager\" agent could oversee the conversation and escalate to human operators if needed.  All the principles from DeepFund — forward-testing evaluation, multi-agent architecture, standardized interfaces, and performance visualization — can be applied here.\n\n**Key Libraries and Frameworks:**\n\n* **LLM Integration:** Langchain, LlamaIndex\n* **Message Brokers:** Redis, RabbitMQ, `node-ipc`\n* **Frontend Frameworks:** React, Vue, Svelte, Angular\n* **Charting Libraries:** Chart.js, D3.js, Highcharts\n* **Game Engines:** Phaser, Babylon.js (if applicable)\n* **Databases:** MongoDB, PostgreSQL, InfluxDB, TimescaleDB\n\nBy adapting the core principles of DeepFund, JavaScript developers can build robust, adaptable, and insightful multi-agent AI systems for a variety of web applications, beyond the financial domain explored in the paper.  The key takeaway is to create a modular, well-structured system with clear communication channels and a robust evaluation framework.",
