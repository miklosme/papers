  "title": "Musical Agent Systems: MACAT and MACataRT",
  "abstract": "Our research explores the development and application of musical agents, human-in-the-loop generative AI systems designed to support music performance and improvisation within co-creative spaces. We introduce MACAT and MACataRT, two distinct musical agent systems crafted to enhance interactive music-making between human musicians and AI. MACAT is optimized for agent-led performance, employing real-time synthesis and self-listening to shape its output autonomously, while MACataRT provides a flexible environment for collaborative improvisation through audio mosaicing and sequence-based learning. Both systems emphasize training on personalized, small datasets, fostering ethical and transparent AI engagement that respects artistic integrity. This research highlights how interactive, artist-centred generative AI can expand creative possibilities, empowering musicians to explore new forms of artistic expression in real-time, performance-driven and music improvisation contexts.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces two novel musical agent systems, MACAT and MACataRT, designed for real-time interactive music generation.  MACAT is optimized for agent-led performance using real-time synthesis and self-listening. MACataRT facilitates human-AI collaborative improvisation through audio mosaicing and sequence-based learning. Both systems are trained on small, personalized datasets, focusing on ethical considerations and artistic integrity.\n\nKey points relevant to LLM-based multi-agent systems include:\n\n* **Small data training:**  Emphasizes using smaller, curated datasets for personalized output and ethical considerations, contrasting with large language models. This is relevant to LLM fine-tuning for specific tasks or domains.\n* **Real-time interaction:** Focuses on real-time interaction between agents and humans, relevant to the development of responsive and interactive LLM-based agents.\n* **Sequence-based learning & Pattern Recognition:**  MACataRT uses sequence-based learning (and the Factor Oracle) to generate music, mirroring how LLMs process and generate text based on sequential input.\n* **Agent-led vs. collaborative modes:**  Exploration of both agent-led (MACAT) and collaborative (MACataRT) music generation provides a framework for designing LLM agents that can either autonomously generate content or collaboratively create with humans.\n* **Ethical considerations:**  Highlights the importance of ethical data usage and transparency, relevant to addressing concerns about bias and copyright in LLM applications.  Specifically regarding music copyright, they clarify that it more closely resembles practices used by DJs and musique concrÃ¨te electroacoustic musicians.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents exciting opportunities for JavaScript developers working with LLM-based multi-agent systems.  Let's translate the core concepts of MACAT and MACataRT into practical JavaScript examples for web development:\n\n**1. Building a Collaborative Music Web App with LangChain and TensorFlow.js:**\n\nImagine a collaborative music composition tool where multiple users and an AI agent co-create music in real-time. This scenario directly reflects the \"co-creative spaces\" emphasized in the paper.\n\n* **Agents:**  Each user acts as an agent, inputting musical phrases or parameters via a web interface (e.g., using Tone.js or Web Audio API). The AI agent, powered by a large language model (LLM) like those offered through LangChain, acts as another musician.\n* **LLM Integration (MACataRT - Reactive Improvisation):**  User input is converted into a format understandable by the LLM (e.g., symbolic music representation, descriptive text). The LLM generates new musical phrases or modifies existing ones based on this input, mimicking MACataRT's reactive improvisation. You can use LangChain to connect your LLM to various tools and data sources.\n* **Model Crafting (MACAT/MACataRT - Proactive Improvisation):** Allow users to upload their own musical samples to create personalized datasets.  Train a smaller model (e.g., a recurrent neural network with TensorFlow.js) on this data, enabling proactive improvisation tailored to the user's style, as in model crafting. LangChain can assist you in managing the data pipeline for this training.\n* **Real-time Interaction (Socket.IO):** Use Socket.IO to facilitate real-time communication between user agents and the AI agent.  This enables synchronous music generation and a collaborative experience.\n\n```javascript\n// Example using LangChain and Tone.js (Simplified)\nimport { OpenAI } from \"langchain/llms/openai\";\nimport { Tone } from 'tone';\n\nconst llm = new OpenAI({ temperature: 0.7 }); // Adjust temperature for creativity\n\nsocket.on('userMusicInput', async (userInput) => {\n  const aiResponse = await llm.call(\n    `Compose a musical phrase that complements this: ${userInput}`\n  );\n\n  // Convert aiResponse (e.g., symbolic music) to playable notes with Tone.js\n  const notes = parseMusic(aiResponse);\n  new Tone.Part((time, note) => {\n    synth.triggerAttackRelease(note, \"8n\", time);\n  }, notes).start();\n\n  // Broadcast the AI-generated music to other users\n  socket.emit('aiMusicOutput', aiResponse);\n});\n```\n\n\n**2.  Interactive Storytelling with Multi-Agent Dialogue:**\n\nConsider a web-based interactive story where user actions influence the narrative, and multiple AI agents (characters) react to those actions and interact with each other.\n\n* **Agents:**  Users and AI-powered characters represent the agents. LLMs drive the characters' dialogue and actions.\n* **Reactive Dialogue:** User actions provide context to the LLMs, which generate appropriate dialogue responses and trigger character actions, reflecting MACataRT's reactivity.\n* **Character Styles (Model Crafting):** Fine-tune smaller language models on specific datasets to create distinct personalities and writing styles for each AI character. This aligns with the idea of personalized model training.\n* **Real-time Narrative Progression (Redux/React):** Manage the story's state and narrative progression using a state management library like Redux with a UI framework like React. This allows for real-time updates to the story based on user interactions and AI agent actions.\n\n**3.  Real-Time Strategy Game with AI Opponents:**\n\nDevelop a browser-based real-time strategy game where players compete against multiple AI opponents.\n\n* **Agents:**  Players and AI-controlled opponents are the agents.\n* **Strategic Decision-Making (Reinforcement Learning):** Train reinforcement learning models to make strategic decisions for the AI opponents. This would involve more complex JavaScript implementations than the previous examples. Libraries like TensorFlow.js could be used.\n* **Adaptability (MACAT's Self-Listening):** Implement a system where AI agents analyze their past actions and game states to adapt their strategies, mirroring MACAT's self-learning aspect.\n\nThese examples show how the principles from the paper can inspire creative web applications. By combining LLMs with JavaScript frameworks and libraries, developers can build engaging and interactive multi-agent systems that push the boundaries of web development. Remember that managing the computational costs of LLMs in real-time applications is crucial and might require optimizing LLM prompts and responses or employing caching strategies.",
