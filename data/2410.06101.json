  "title": "Coevolving with the Other You: Fine-Tuning LLM with Sequential Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning",
  "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a pivotal technique for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on specific tasks. However, prevailing RL fine-tuning methods predominantly rely on PPO and its variants. Though these algorithms are effective in general RL settings, they often exhibit suboptimal performance and vulnerability to distribution collapse when applied to the fine-tuning of LLMs. In this paper, we propose CORY, extending the RL fine-tuning of LLMs to a sequential cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, to leverage the inherent coevolution and emergent capabilities of multi-agent systems. In CORY, the LLM to be fine-tuned is initially duplicated into two autonomous agents: a pioneer and an observer. The pioneer generates responses based on queries, while the observer generates responses using both the queries and the pioneer's responses. The two agents are trained together. During training, the agents exchange roles periodically, fostering cooperation and coevolution between them. Experiments evaluate CORY's performance by fine-tuning GPT-2 and Llama-2 under subjective and objective reward functions on the IMDB Review and GSM8K datasets, respectively. Results show that CORY outperforms PPO in terms of policy optimality, resistance to distribution collapse, and training robustness, thereby underscoring its potential as a superior methodology for refining LLMs in real-world applications.",
  "summary": "This research introduces CORY, a novel method for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) by framing the process as a sequential cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning problem. \n\nInstead of training a single LLM, CORY duplicates the LLM into a \"pioneer\" and \"observer\" that learn collaboratively. The key mechanisms are: \n\n* **Knowledge Transfer:** The observer learns from both the user query and the pioneer's response, allowing it to better align with the task reward and avoid straying too far from the original LLM (distribution collapse).\n* **Role Exchange:** The pioneer and observer periodically switch roles, preventing the observer from becoming overly reliant on the pioneer's output and ensuring both LLMs can operate independently.\n\nExperiments demonstrate that compared to traditional RL fine-tuning (PPO), CORY achieves comparable or better performance with improved training stability, robustness to distribution collapse, and better balancing of task reward and KL divergence.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents a novel approach to fine-tuning LLMs using multi-agent reinforcement learning, which can lead to more robust and efficient LLM agents for web development. Here are some practical examples of how JavaScript developers can leverage these insights:\n\n**1. Collaborative Content Creation:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine building a web app for collaborative story writing, where multiple users contribute to a narrative.\n* **Implementation:** \n    * Each user interacts with an LLM agent (pioneer or observer) that assists in generating text, given the story's context.\n    * Use a framework like **Node.js** to manage backend interactions between agents and a database to store the evolving story.\n    *  Employ a JavaScript library like **TensorFlow.js** to run LLM models client-side, enabling real-time text generation and feedback.\n    * As users write, the agents exchange roles (pioneer/observer) periodically, leveraging the knowledge transfer mechanism of CORY to refine their outputs based on each other's strengths. \n    * The final output can be presented using a front-end framework like **React** to provide a seamless collaborative writing interface.\n\n**2. Enhanced Chatbot Interactions:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Develop a customer support chatbot that learns from multiple expert agents and improves over time.\n* **Implementation:**\n    *  Train several specialized LLM agents on specific domains of customer support (e.g., technical issues, billing inquiries, product information).\n    * Use a message queue system like **RabbitMQ** to enable asynchronous communication and knowledge transfer between the chatbot agents as they interact with users.\n    * Implement a role exchange mechanism where agents periodically switch roles based on the conversation flow, allowing them to learn from diverse interactions and become more well-rounded.\n    * Employ a framework like **Dialogflow** to integrate the multi-agent system into a user-friendly chat interface.\n\n**3. Personalized Learning Experiences:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Create an interactive educational web app where LLMs adapt to individual student learning styles.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * Design multiple LLM agents, each specializing in different teaching approaches (e.g., visual learning, problem-solving, conceptual explanations).\n    *  Use a JavaScript library like **JS-Cookie** to track user interactions and preferences, allowing the system to dynamically assign roles to agents based on individual needs. \n    *  Implement CORY's knowledge transfer and role exchange mechanisms to personalize the learning path, with agents adapting their teaching strategies based on student progress and engagement.\n    * Utilize a front-end framework like **Vue.js** to build an engaging and adaptive user interface for the educational platform.\n\n**Key Takeaways for JavaScript Developers:**\n\n* **Think Beyond Single Agents:** The paper encourages a paradigm shift from individual LLM agents to collaborative multi-agent systems. \n* **Leverage Existing Tools:** JavaScript offers a rich ecosystem of frameworks and libraries (Node.js, TensorFlow.js, Dialogflow, etc.) that can be adapted for building such systems.\n* **Experiment and Iterate:**  The paper provides a solid foundation for implementing CORY. Experiment with different agent configurations, role exchange strategies, and reward functions to find what works best for your specific application.\n\nBy embracing the concepts outlined in this paper, JavaScript developers can contribute to a new generation of more intelligent, adaptive, and user-centric web applications.",

It iterates through the following steps:\n    - **Data Sampling:**  Selects a batch of queries from the dataset.\n    - **Pioneer Action:** The pioneer LLM generates a response to the query.\n    - **Observer Action:** The observer LLM generates a response, utilizing both the query and the pioneer's response.\n    - **Reward Calculation:**  Rewards are calculated for both LLMs based on their respective responses.\n    - **Buffer Update:**  Training data (query, response, reward) is stored in separate buffers for each LLM.\n    - **LLM Update:** Both LLMs are updated using the PPO algorithm (Algorithm 2) based on their buffer data.\n    - **Role Exchange:** The roles of the pioneer and observer are swapped periodically to avoid prompt bias and promote more robust learning. \n\n2. **PPO-based Token-Level Policy Update (Algorithm 2):** This is a simplified representation of a standard Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) update loop. It would typically include:\n    - **Advantage Calculation:** Estimating the advantage of each action (token) using methods like Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE).\n    - **Value Network Update:**  Updating the value network to better predict the value of being in a given state.\n    - **Policy Network Update:** Updating the policy network using clipped surrogate objectives to ensure stable learning and prevent drastic policy changes.\n\n**Purpose:**\n\nThe CORY algorithm aims to improve the performance and stability of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs). It leverages the concept of multi-agent learning, where two LLMs collaborate and learn from each other, resulting in:\n\n- **Improved Policy Optimality:**  The observer benefits from the pioneer's knowledge, leading to potentially better responses.\n- **Enhanced Training Robustness:**  The role exchange mechanism makes both LLMs more adaptable and less prone to overfitting to specific prompt formats. \n- **Mitigation of Distribution Collapse:** By encouraging cooperation and exchanging roles, CORY helps LLMs maintain a balance between maximizing task rewards and staying closer to the original pre-trained distribution, thus reducing the risk of distribution collapse.",
