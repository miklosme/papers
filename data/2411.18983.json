  "title": "SPAgent: Adaptive Task Decomposition and Model Selection for General Video Generation and Editing",
  "abstract": "While open-source video generation and editing models have made significant progress, individual models are typically limited to specific tasks, failing to meet the diverse needs of users. Effectively coordinating these models can unlock a wide range of video generation and editing capabilities. However, manual coordination is complex and time-consuming, requiring users to deeply understand task requirements and possess comprehensive knowledge of each model's performance, applicability, and limitations, thereby increasing the barrier to entry. To address these challenges, we propose a novel video generation and editing system powered by our Semantic Planning Agent (SPAgent). SPAgent bridges the gap between diverse user intents and the effective utilization of existing generative models, enhancing the adaptability, efficiency, and overall quality of video generation and editing. Specifically, the SPAgent assembles a tool library integrating state-of-the-art open-source image and video generation and editing models as tools. After fine-tuning on our manually annotated dataset, SPAgent can automatically coordinate the tools for video generation and editing, through our novelly designed three-step framework: (1) decoupled intent recognition, (2) principle-guided route planning, and (3) capability-based execution model selection. Additionally, we enhance the SPAgent's video quality evaluation capability, enabling it to autonomously assess and incorporate new video generation and editing models into its tool library without human intervention. Experimental results demonstrate that the SPAgent effectively coordinates models to generate or edit videos, highlighting its versatility and adaptability across various video tasks.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces SPAgent, a system for automating video generation and editing tasks by coordinating various open-source AI models like specialized tools.  SPAgent uses an MLLM agent to understand user requests, plan execution steps based on predefined principles, select the best models for each step, and even evaluate and integrate new models autonomously.  Key to its design is the decoupling of intent recognition from the execution planning and model selection, allowing it to handle diverse inputs (text, images, videos) and complex, multi-step editing requests. It also features automatic quality assessment, allowing SPAgent to incorporate and leverage new video generation and editing models without manual intervention.",
  "takeaways": "This paper introduces SPAgent, a system for coordinating multiple open-source video generation and editing models using an LLM as a central planning agent. Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights to their LLM-based multi-agent AI projects, focusing on web development:\n\n**1. Decoupled Intent Recognition (DIR) in JavaScript:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine a web app where users can generate videos based on text prompts, uploaded images, or a combination.  The user might provide an image of a cat with the text \"Make this cat fly.\"\n* **Implementation:** Use a JavaScript-based natural language processing (NLP) library like Compromise or Natural for basic text analysis. Extract keywords, entities (like \"cat\"), and actions (\"fly\").  Analyze image content with a library like TensorFlow.js to identify objects (\"cat\") and scenes.  Compare the text and image analyses to determine the user intent (video editing with added animation).\n* **Code Example (Conceptual):**\n\n```javascript\nimport * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';\nimport nlp from 'compromise';\n\nasync function decoupleIntent(text, imageFile) {\n  const textAnalysis = nlp(text);\n  const imageModel = await tf.loadLayersModel('path/to/image/model');\n  const imageTensor = await loadImageToTensor(imageFile);\n  const imageAnalysis = await imageModel.predict(imageTensor);\n\n  const intent = determineIntent(textAnalysis, imageAnalysis);\n  return intent; // e.g., { action: 'animate', object: 'cat', modify: 'fly' }\n}\n```\n\n\n**2. Principle-Guided Route Planning (PRP) with JavaScript:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Based on the intent (e.g., animate cat, make it fly), plan a sequence of operations.\n* **Implementation:**  Represent the available video generation/editing models (like the paper's tool library) as JavaScript objects with their capabilities. Use a rule engine or a simple state machine in JavaScript to define execution routes.  For \"make cat fly,\" the route might be: 1) Image Segmentation (extract cat), 2) Animation Model (apply flying motion), 3) Video compositing (place animated cat into a background video/image).\n* **Code Example (Conceptual):**\n\n```javascript\nconst routes = {\n  'animate_object': [\n    { task: 'segment', model: 'segmentationModel' },\n    { task: 'animate', model: 'animationModel', params: { motion: 'fly' } },\n    { task: 'composite', model: 'compositingModel' }\n  ],\n  // ... other routes\n};\n\nfunction planRoute(intent) {\n  return routes[intent.action + '_' + intent.object] || []; // Select route based on intent\n}\n```\n\n\n**3. Capability-Based Model Selection (CMS) in JavaScript:**\n\n* **Scenario:** For each task in the route, choose the best model.\n* **Implementation:**  Store model performance statistics (like the paper's *D<sub>m</sub>*) in a JavaScript object or JSON file. Based on the subject (\"cat\") and the task (\"animate\"), select the model with the highest score for animating animals. This could integrate with serverless functions or cloud APIs that offer these model capabilities.\n* **Code Example (Conceptual):**\n\n```javascript\nconst modelStats = {\n  animationModel: { animals: 0.9, landscapes: 0.7 },\n  // ... other models\n};\n\nfunction selectModel(task, subject) {\n  let bestModel = null;\n  let highestScore = -1;\n\n  for (const model in modelStats) {\n    if (modelStats[model][subject] > highestScore) {\n      bestModel = model;\n      highestScore = modelStats[model][subject];\n    }\n  }\n  return bestModel;\n}\n```\n\n\n**4.  Video Quality Evaluation (VQE) with JavaScript and Serverless:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Automatically evaluate generated videos.\n* **Implementation:**  Use serverless functions (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions) or cloud APIs to send the generated video to a pre-trained video quality assessment model.  Receive the score and update the `modelStats` in your JavaScript code. This enables dynamic adaptation to model performance over time.\n\n\n**5.  Multi-Agent Communication with WebSockets/Server-Sent Events:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Different JavaScript modules or serverless functions act as agents, specializing in specific tasks (NLP, image analysis, video generation).\n* **Implementation:** Use WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE) to enable real-time communication and data exchange between these agents.  For example, the NLP agent sends the intent to the PRP agent, which then sends the route to the CMS agent.\n\n\n**JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries:**\n\n* **Frontend:** React, Vue, or Angular for building the user interface.\n* **Backend/Serverless:** Node.js, Express.js, Serverless Framework.\n* **TensorFlow.js:** For image and video processing.\n* **Compromise, Natural:** For NLP tasks.\n* **WebSockets libraries (Socket.IO), EventSource (for SSE):** For inter-agent communication.\n\n\nBy combining these elements, you can create a complex web application that uses LLM-powered agents to generate and edit videos based on diverse user inputs, similar to SPAgent's functionality. This example showcases the practical application of the paper's concepts in a JavaScript/web development context. Remember to adapt and extend these concepts based on the specific requirements of your project.",
  "pseudocode": "Here's a breakdown of the algorithmic logic presented in the paper and its JavaScript representation, along with explanations:\n\n**1. Decoupled Intent Recognition (DIR)**\n\n* **Purpose:** To analyze user input (text, image, video, or a combination) and determine the intent (e.g., text-to-video, video editing) and the subject of the intended video.\n* **Algorithm:**\n    1. Analyze input text type (None or natural language).\n    2. Analyze input visual type (None, single image, or video).\n    3. Based on the text, categorize the subject into predefined categories (sports, transportation, etc.).\n\n* **JavaScript Representation:**\n\n```javascript\nfunction decoupledIntentRecognition(userInput) {\n  const intent = {};\n\n  // 1. Text Analysis\n  intent.textType = userInput.text ? \"natural language text\" : \"None\";\n\n  // 2. Visual Analysis\n  if (!userInput.visual) {\n    intent.visualType = \"None\";\n  } else if (Array.isArray(userInput.visual) || userInput.visual.type === 'video') { // Check if array or video object\n    intent.visualType = \"video\";\n  } else {\n    intent.visualType = \"single image\";\n  }\n\n  // 3. Subject Categorization (Simplified - needs more sophisticated NLP)\n  const categories = [\"sports\", \"transportation\", \"people\", \"animals\", \"objects\", \"landscapes\"];\n  //  (Replace with actual NLP-based subject extraction)\n  intent.subject = categories.find(category => userInput.text && userInput.text.includes(category)) || \"unknown\";\n\n\n  return intent;\n}\n\n\n\n// Example usage:\nconst userInput1 = { text: \"A car racing on a track\", visual: {type:'image'} };\nconst intent1 = decoupledIntentRecognition(userInput1);\nconsole.log(intent1); // Example Output: {textType: \"natural language text\", visualType: \"single image\", subject: \"transportation\"}\n\nconst userInput2 = { text: \"Edit this video to make it faster\", visual: [{type:'image'},{type:'image'}] }; // Simplified video representation as an array of image-like frames\nconst intent2 = decoupledIntentRecognition(userInput2);\nconsole.log(intent2); // Example Output: {textType: \"natural language text\", visualType: \"video\", subject: \"unknown\"}\n\n```\n\n**2. Principle-Guided Route Planning (PRP)**\n\n* **Purpose:** To dynamically plan a sequence of tasks (e.g., text-to-image, then image-to-video) required to achieve the user's intent.\n* **Algorithm:** The paper outlines principles based on input type and alignment. The code demonstrates a simplified version of those principles.  The full implementation requires a more comprehensive rule set and potentially, a state machine.\n\n* **JavaScript Representation:**\n\n```javascript\nfunction principleGuidedRoutePlanning(intent) {\n  const routes = [];\n\n  if (intent.visualType === \"None\") {\n    routes.push([\"text_to_video\"]);\n    routes.push([\"text_to_image\", \"image_to_video\"]);\n  } else if (intent.visualType === \"video\") {\n    routes.push([\"video_to_video\"]);\n    routes.push([\"video_to_video\"]); // Duplicate for consistency as per the paper.\n  } else { // Single Image\n    // (Simplified logic - the paper has alignment checks here)\n    routes.push([\"image_to_video\"]);\n    routes.push([\"image_to_image\", \"image_to_video\"]);\n  }\n\n  return routes;\n}\n\n// Example usage (using output from previous example)\nconst routes = principleGuidedRoutePlanning(intent1);\nconsole.log(routes); // Example output: [ [ 'image_to_video' ], [ 'image_to_image', 'image_to_video' ] ]\n\n```\n\n**3. Capability-Based Model Selection (CMS)**\n\n* **Purpose:** To choose the best models from a library to execute each task in the planned route, considering the subject and model capabilities.\n* **Algorithm:**  Select models based on the highest \"strength\" value for the given subject.\n* **JavaScript Representation:**\n\n```javascript\n\nconst modelLibrary = { // Example Model Library\n    \"text_to_video\": {\n        \"modelA\": { sports: 1500, landscapes: 1800 },\n        \"modelB\": { people: 1900, transportation: 1200 }\n    },\n    \"image_to_video\": { // ... other task models\n        \"modelC\": {sports:1200, landscapes:1900}\n\n    },\n     \"image_to_image\": { // ... other task models}\n\n};\n\nfunction capabilityBasedModelSelection(routes, intent, modelLibrary) {\n  const selectedModels = [];\n    routes.forEach(route => {\n        const modelList = [];\n        route.forEach(task =>{\n            const bestModel = Object.keys(modelLibrary[task]).reduce((best, current) => {\n                if (modelLibrary[task][current][intent.subject] > (modelLibrary[task][best]?.[intent.subject] || 0))\n                    return current;\n                    return best;\n                }, null);\n                modelList.push(bestModel); //Could be null if no suitable model.\n\n            });\n            selectedModels.push(modelList);\n        });\n\n\n  return selectedModels;\n}\n\n\nconst selectedModels = capabilityBasedModelSelection(routes, intent1, modelLibrary);\nconsole.log(selectedModels);  //Example Output: (If intent1 subject is \"transportation): [[null], [null, null]]  (because there are no matching models in the simplified example library).  If subject had been \"landscapes\": [[ \"modelA\"],[\"modelC\", null]\n\n\n```\n\n\n\n**4. Video Quality Evaluation (VQE)**\n\n* **Purpose:** To automatically assess the quality of generated videos based on intrinsic quality and prompt alignment. This is not represented as an algorithm with steps in the paper, it is based on a prompt instructing an LLM to do the evaluation.\n\n\n\nKey improvements and further development considerations:\n\n* **Error Handling:**  The JavaScript examples lack robust error handling (e.g., what if a task has no suitable model in the library).  Production code would require this.\n* **NLP for Subject Detection:**  The subject detection in the `decoupledIntentRecognition` function is extremely simplified. A robust implementation needs proper natural language processing (NLP) techniques.\n* **Model Library:** The provided model library is a minimal example. A real application would require a well-structured and extensive library.\n* **Prompt Engineering:** The quality of the entire system heavily relies on the quality of the prompts.  Experimentation and refinement would be crucial.\n* **Asynchronous Operations:** Video generation/editing is time-consuming. Asynchronous JavaScript (Promises, async/await) is essential for a good user experience.\n\n\nThese JavaScript examples provide a basic structural foundation based on the conceptual algorithms described in the paper.  Considerable work is required to create a fully functioning application, and proper implementation of NLP, robust prompt engineering, error handling and asynchronous processing are critical for success.",
