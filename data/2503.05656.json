  "title": "Small-Scale Testbeds for Connected and Automated Vehicles and Robot Swarms: Challenges and a Roadmap",
  "abstract": "Abstract-This article proposes a roadmap to address the current challenges in small-scale testbeds for Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) and robot swarms. The roadmap is a joint effort of participants in the workshop \"1st Workshop on Small-Scale Testbeds for Connected and Automated Vehicles and Robot Swarms,\" held on June 2 at the IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV) 2024 in Jeju, South Korea. The roadmap contains three parts: 1) enhancing accessibility and diversity, especially for underrepresented communities, 2) sharing best practices for the development and maintenance of testbeds, and 3) connecting testbeds through an abstraction layer to support collaboration. The workshop features eight invited speakers, four contributed papers [1]â€“[4], and a presentation of a survey paper on testbeds [5]. The survey paper provides an online comparative table of more than 25 testbeds, available at https://bassamlab.github.io/testbeds-survey. The workshop's own website is available at https://cpm-remote.lrt.unibw-muenchen.de/iv24-workshop.",
  "summary": "This paper proposes a roadmap for developing and using small-scale testbeds for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) and robot swarms. It addresses the challenges of transferring simulations to reality (Sim2Real), scaling from small to full-scale deployments, and handling real-world uncertainties like unpredictable environments and distributed computing demands.\n\nFor LLM-based multi-agent systems, the key takeaways are the importance of high-fidelity simulations, modeling complex multi-agent interactions, addressing communication uncertainties, and establishing standardized frameworks and abstraction layers for interconnecting different testbeds and facilitating collaborative research. The paper emphasizes the need for robust distributed computing solutions under resource constraints, highlighting the relevance for LLM-based agents which may be computationally intensive.  The roadmap also stresses the importance of diverse datasets and testbed designs, which is relevant to training and evaluating LLM-based agents in varied real-world scenarios.",
  "takeaways": "This paper's roadmap for small-scale testbeds offers valuable insights for JavaScript developers working on LLM-based multi-agent AI projects, especially in web development. Here are some practical examples:\n\n**1. Sim2Real Transition & Simulation Fidelity:**\n\n* **Problem:** LLMs acting as agents in a simulated web environment (e.g., a virtual e-commerce site) may not behave realistically in a real deployment due to differences in user behavior, network latency, or third-party API responses.\n* **Solution:** Use JavaScript libraries like Puppeteer or Playwright to create realistic simulated web environments that capture these complexities. Integrate real-world data (e.g., user interaction logs, network performance metrics) into the simulation. This improves the simulation fidelity and reduces the Sim2Real gap.  Developers can also incorporate mock API responses based on real-world traffic to simulate realistic backend interactions.\n\n* **Example:**  A developer building a multi-agent customer support chatbot system can use Puppeteer to simulate a real webpage with forms and chat interfaces.  They can train LLM agents in this simulated environment with realistic user input data from previous chat logs, making the agents more robust to real-world user queries.\n\n**2. Dynamic Environment Complexity & Multi-Agent Interaction Fidelity:**\n\n* **Problem:** Testing multi-agent interaction complexities (e.g., negotiation, collaboration, competition) in a simple web environment might not reveal issues that arise in dynamic, real-world scenarios.\n* **Solution:** Develop a dynamic front-end test environment using React or Vue.js where multiple LLM-powered agents interact. Inject events (e.g., changing product prices, fluctuating user traffic, simulated network interruptions) to simulate real-world unpredictability. This reveals issues with agent coordination and robustness in dynamic settings.\n\n* **Example:**  In a multi-agent auction system, simulate changing bid prices, new bidders entering the auction at random intervals, and temporary network disconnections. This will test the LLM agents' ability to adapt to changing auction dynamics and maintain communication and coordination with other agents.\n\n**3. Distributed Computing & Communication:**\n\n* **Problem:** LLMs powering web agents might experience communication overhead and synchronization issues when deployed in a distributed manner across different servers or browser clients.\n* **Solution:** Use WebSockets or Server-Sent Events to establish real-time communication channels between agents. Implement message queues (e.g., using libraries like Bull or RabbitMQ) to manage asynchronous communication and ensure reliable message delivery. This allows developers to build distributed multi-agent web applications that are robust and efficient.  Employing front-end frameworks like Socket.IO can simplify WebSocket integration in the browser for client-side agents.\n\n* **Example:** A collaborative document editing application with multiple LLM-powered agents could use WebSockets for real-time synchronization of edits across different users.  Each LLM agent edits locally and transmits changes via WebSockets, allowing real-time collaborative editing without constant full document synchronization.\n\n**4. An Abstraction Layer & Interoperability:**\n\n* **Problem:** Integrating different LLM-powered agents developed with various tools or frameworks can be challenging due to incompatibility and lack of standardization.\n* **Solution:** Design a JavaScript-based abstraction layer that defines common interfaces for agent communication, state representation, and action execution. This layer can be a simple API or a more complex framework. This enables developers to easily integrate and swap different LLM agents, promoting interoperability.\n\n* **Example:**  Developers can create an abstraction layer in JavaScript that exposes standard functions for communication and action execution. This allows different LLM agents, potentially even from different providers or trained on different datasets, to interact seamlessly within a web application like a virtual world or collaborative design tool.\n\n\nBy applying these insights, JavaScript developers can leverage small-scale testbeds effectively to build more robust and reliable LLM-based multi-agent web applications that are prepared for the complexities of real-world deployment. Remember that the core concept is iterative development and testing in increasingly realistic environments, just like the paper suggests.",
