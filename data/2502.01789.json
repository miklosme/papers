  "title": "An Agentic AI Workflow for Detecting Cognitive Concerns in Real-world Data",
  "abstract": "Early identification of cognitive concerns is critical but often hindered by subtle symptom presentation. This study developed and validated a fully automated, multi-agent AI workflow using LLaMA 3 8B to identify cognitive concerns in 3,338 clinical notes from Mass General Brigham. The agentic workflow, leveraging task-specific agents that dynamically collaborate to extract meaningful insights from clinical notes, was compared to an expert-driven benchmark. Both workflows achieved high classification performance, with F1-scores of 0.90 and 0.91, respectively. The agentic workflow demonstrated improved specificity (1.00) and achieved prompt refinement in fewer iterations. Although both workflows showed reduced performance on validation data, the agentic workflow maintained perfect specificity. These findings highlight the potential of fully automated multi-agent AI workflows to achieve expert-level accuracy with greater efficiency, offering a scalable and cost-effective solution for detecting cognitive concerns in clinical settings.",
  "summary": "This research explores using a multi-agent AI system and LLMs to detect cognitive concerns from patient clinical notes.  The system uses specialized agents for prompt refinement, evaluation, specificity improvement, sensitivity improvement, and summarization.  Compared to an expert-driven approach, the multi-agent system achieved similar accuracy with fewer prompt iterations. Key points for LLM-based multi-agent systems include: specialized agents can improve prompt engineering and model performance; iterative refinement is crucial; and this approach can automate tasks, improving efficiency in areas like clinical screening.  However, challenges like overfitting and handling non-conforming LLM outputs need further investigation.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents valuable insights for JavaScript developers working with LLM-based multi-agent systems, especially in web development contexts. Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply the learnings:\n\n**1. Agentic Workflow Implementation using Langchain.js and a Frontend Framework:**\n\nThe core concept of specialized agents can be implemented using Langchain.js. Each agent (Specialist, Evaluator, Improver, Summarizer) can be a separate Langchain chain.\n\n```javascript\n// Example using Langchain.js\nimport { LLMChain, PromptTemplate } from \"langchain\";\nimport { OpenAI } from \"langchain/llms/openai\";\n\n// Specialist Agent\nconst specialistTemplate = \"You are a specialist in {area}. {question}\";\nconst specialistPrompt = new PromptTemplate({\n  template: specialistTemplate,\n  inputVariables: [\"area\", \"question\"],\n});\nconst specialistLLM = new OpenAI({ temperature: 0.1 }); // Mimicking paper's temperature\nconst specialistChain = new LLMChain({ llm: specialistLLM, prompt: specialistPrompt });\n\n// Similarly create Evaluator, Improver, and Summarizer chains\n\nasync function agenticWorkflow(clinicalNote) {\n  const specialistResponse = await specialistChain.call({ area: \"cognitive decline\", question: `Is this note indicative of any cognitive concern? Provide reasoning. \\n${clinicalNote}`});\n  // ... pass specialistResponse to Evaluator, then conditionally to Improvers and Summarizers\n}\n\n// In a React component\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  const [result, setResult] = useState(\"\");\n\n  const handleAnalyze = async (note) => {\n    const analysis = await agenticWorkflow(note);\n    setResult(analysis);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <textarea onChange={(e) => handleAnalyze(e.target.value)} />\n      <p>{result}</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\n```\n\nThis snippet showcases how Langchain.js can build individual agents.  A frontend framework like React manages UI and user interactions. Note the use of a low temperature (0.1) for the LLM, similar to the research paper.\n\n**2. Prompt Engineering and Refinement:**\n\nThe paper highlights the importance of prompt refinement.  You can store prompts in a database or JSON file and iteratively improve them based on agent feedback.  Version control for prompts becomes crucial, allowing rollback to previous versions if refinements are ineffective.\n\n```javascript\n// Example Prompt Versioning in a JSON file\n{\n  \"prompts\": [\n    {\n      \"version\": \"1.0\",\n      \"specialistPrompt\": \"Is this note indicative of any cognitive concern?\",\n      \"evaluatorPrompt\": // ...,\n      // ...other prompts\n    },\n    {\n      \"version\": \"1.1\",\n      \"specialistPrompt\": \"Considering symptoms, history, and findings, is this note indicative of cognitive concern?\",\n      // ... updated prompts\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**3. Handling Uncertainties and Edge Cases:**\n\nThe research encountered \"uncertain\" outputs. In a web app, handle these gracefully:\n\n* **UI Feedback:** Display \"Uncertain. More information required.\" to the user.\n* **Human-in-the-Loop:** Provide an interface for clinicians to review uncertain cases and provide feedback, which can be used to further refine the prompts.\n* **Confidence Scores:** Integrate confidence scores from the LLM to provide a measure of certainty. Display this alongside the result (e.g., \"Cognitive concern detected (Confidence: 85%)\").\n\n**4. Data Management and Privacy:**\n\n* **Client-Side Processing:** For sensitive data, consider client-side processing using web workers or libraries like TensorFlow.js to minimize data transfer.\n* **Secure Storage:** Use secure storage mechanisms (encrypted databases, secure cookies) for prompts and user data.\n\n**5. Visualization with D3.js or Chart.js:**\n\nVisualize agent interactions, prompt refinement progress, and evaluation metrics using JavaScript libraries like D3.js or Chart.js. This offers insights into the system's performance and areas for improvement.\n\n**Example scenario:** A telehealth platform using multi-agent LLMs for initial cognitive assessment.\n\n* **Agent 1 (Information Gathering):** Extracts relevant information from patient-entered text data.\n* **Agent 2 (Cognitive Assessment):** Uses refined prompts (similar to AP2 in the paper) to analyze the extracted information.\n* **Agent 3 (Report Generation):** Summarizes findings for clinicians, highlighting potential cognitive concerns.\n\nBy incorporating these practical strategies, JavaScript developers can translate the research findings into robust and user-friendly web applications that leverage the power of multi-agent AI systems for real-world problems. Remember to prioritize ethical considerations and data privacy throughout the development process.",
  "pseudocode": "No pseudocode block found. However, the paper describes an agentic workflow with specialized agents interacting.  While not presented in pseudocode, we can represent core logic in JavaScript to illustrate the concept. This isn't a full implementation, but a conceptual sketch for demonstration.\n\n```javascript\n// Conceptual representation of the Agentic Workflow\n\nclass Specialist {\n  constructor(llm) {\n    this.llm = llm; // The underlying LLM (e.g., LLaMA)\n  }\n\n  analyzeNote(note, prompt) {\n    // Use the LLM to analyze the note with the given prompt\n    const response = this.llm.generate(prompt + \"\\n\" + note);\n    // Process the LLM's response (yes/no + reason)\n    return this.processResponse(response); \n  }\n\n  // ... other methods for processing LLM responses, etc.\n}\n\n\nclass Evaluator {\n  constructor() { /* ... */ }\n\n  evaluatePerformance(specialist, notes, prompts, trueLabels) {\n    const predictions = notes.map((note) => specialist.analyzeNote(note, prompts));\n    // Compare predictions with trueLabels to calculate sensitivity, specificity, etc.\n    return this.calculateMetrics(predictions, trueLabels);\n  }\n  // ... other methods for metric calculations\n}\n\nclass SpecificityImprover {\n  constructor(sop) {  // sop: Standard Operating Procedure\n    this.sop = sop;\n  }\n\n  refinePrompt(falsePositives, currentPrompt) {\n    // Analyze false positive cases using SOP guidelines\n    const analysis = this.analyzeFalsePositives(falsePositives, this.sop);\n    // Adjust the prompt based on the analysis\n    return this.adjustPrompt(currentPrompt, analysis);\n  }\n\n // ...other methods for analysis, prompt adjustment\n}\n\n\n\n// Example usage (simplified)\nconst llm = new LLAMA(); // Hypothetical LLAMA class\nconst specialist = new Specialist(llm);\nconst evaluator = new Evaluator();\nconst sop = { /* ... SOP guidelines ... */ };\nconst specificityImprover = new SpecificityImprover(sop);\n\n\n// Initial prompt\nlet prompt = \"Is this note indicative of any cognitive concern, yes or no?\";\n\n// ... load clinical notes and true labels\n\n// Evaluation loop (simplified - no sensitivity improver or summarizers shown)\nconst metrics = evaluator.evaluatePerformance(specialist, notes, prompt, trueLabels);\nif (metrics.specificity < 0.8) {\n  // Identify false positives\n  // ... logic to identify false positives based on comparison with true labels\n  prompt = specificityImprover.refinePrompt(falsePositives, prompt);\n\n  // ... further iterations as needed\n}\n\n```\n\n**Explanation of the conceptual code:**\n\nThis JavaScript code demonstrates a simplified version of the multi-agent system described in the paper.  \n\n* **`Specialist`**: This agent utilizes the LLM to analyze individual clinical notes given a prompt, returning a prediction (yes/no for cognitive concern) and a reason.\n\n* **`Evaluator`**: This agent assesses the `Specialist`'s performance by comparing its predictions on a set of notes against the ground truth labels, calculating metrics like sensitivity and specificity.\n\n* **`SpecificityImprover`**: This agent refines the prompt based on analysis of false positives, guided by the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP).\n\nThe code illustrates the iterative process of prompt refinement, where the `Evaluator`'s feedback triggers the `SpecificityImprover` to adjust the prompt, aiming to improve performance in subsequent iterations.\n\nThis is a very high-level sketch. A full implementation would require substantial additional code for LLM interaction, prompt management, metric calculation, SOP representation, and the logic of the other agents (Sensitivity Improver, Summarizers).  However, it helps to translate the core concepts of the multi-agent workflow into a more concrete and familiar format for JavaScript developers.  This type of structure can serve as a starting point for building more complex multi-agent applications using LLMs in JavaScript.",
