  "title": "Towards a HIPAA Compliant Agentic AI System in Healthcare",
  "abstract": "Agentic AI systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) as their foundational reasoning engine, are transforming clinical workflows such as medical report generation and clinical summarization by autonomously analyzing sensitive healthcare data and executing decisions with minimal human oversight. However, their adoption demands strict compliance with regulatory frameworks such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), particularly when handling Protected Health Information (PHI). This work-in-progress paper introduces a HIPAA-compliant Agentic AI framework that enforces regulatory compliance through dynamic, context-aware policy enforcement. Our framework integrates three core mechanisms: (1) Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) for granular PHI governance, (2) a hybrid PHI sanitization pipeline combining regex patterns and BERT-based model to minimize leakage, and (3) immutable audit trails for compliance verification.",
  "summary": "This paper proposes a framework for building HIPAA-compliant agentic AI systems in healthcare, focusing on securing sensitive patient data (PHI).  It utilizes a multi-agent system where different agents are responsible for access control, data sanitization, and auditing.\n\nKey points for LLM-based multi-agent systems:\n\n* **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):**  Dynamically grants or restricts access to PHI based on user roles, data sensitivity, and context, crucial for LLMs accessing sensitive data.\n* **Hybrid Sanitization Pipeline:** Combines regex and BERT-based models to redact PHI before and after LLM processing, minimizing data leakage and supporting HIPAA compliance.\n* **Immutable Audit Trails:** Logs all interactions with PHI, enabling traceability and compliance verification, important for accountability in LLM-driven workflows.\n* **Middleware Agent:** Mediates interactions with the LLM, enforcing policies, managing session context, and analyzing conversation flow for cumulative risk assessment of PHI exposure.\n* **Real-world applicability with consideration for BAA (Business Associate Agreement):** Acknowledges the need for BAA compliance when using third-party LLM APIs, a practical concern for developers.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents exciting opportunities for JavaScript developers working with LLM-based multi-agent systems in healthcare web applications. Here are some practical examples and suggestions leveraging JavaScript frameworks and libraries:\n\n**1. Implementing ABAC in a React Application:**\n\n* **Scenario:** A web application displays patient data based on user roles (doctor, nurse, patient).\n* **Implementation:**\n    * Use a library like `Casbin.js` for ABAC implementation. Define policies in Casbin's model language, expressing rules like \"doctors can access all patient data,\" \"nurses can access vital signs,\" and \"patients can only access their own data.\"\n    * Integrate `Casbin.js` with your React components. Before rendering sensitive data, use the `Casbin.js` enforcer to check if the current user (based on their role and other attributes) has access.  For example:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Enforcer } from 'casbin';\n\n// ... within a React component\nconst enforcer = new Enforcer('model.conf', 'policy.csv'); // Load your model and policy\n\nasync function canView(dataSensitivity) {\n  const userRole = getUserRole(); // Retrieve user role from application state\n  const action = 'read';\n  const result = await enforcer.enforce(userRole, dataSensitivity, action);\n  return result;\n}\n\n// ... in your render method\n{ canView('patient_record') && <PatientRecord data={patientData} /> }\n```\n\n\n**2. PHI Sanitization Pipeline in Node.js:**\n\n* **Scenario:** A Node.js backend processes patient data before sending it to an LLM for summarization.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * Create a sanitization pipeline using Node.js streams.\n    * Implement regex-based redaction using JavaScript's built-in regular expression capabilities:\n\n```javascript\nconst sanitizedText = patientText.replace(/(\\d{3}-\\d{2}-\\d{4})/g, '[REDACTED]');\n```\n\n\n    * Integrate a BERT-based model for contextual PHI identification. Use a library like `Hugging Face Transformers.js` for client-side or `node-bert` for server-side BERT inference.\n    * Send the sanitized data to the LLM.\n\n\n**3. Immutable Audit Trails using Blockchain:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  Log every data access, policy decision, and redaction action in a tamper-proof way.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * Integrate with a blockchain platform like `Hyperledger Fabric` or `Ethereum` (using `web3.js`).\n    * Store a hash of each log entry on the blockchain, making it immutable.\n    * This ensures accountability and provides a verifiable record for audits.\n\n```javascript\nimport Web3 from 'web3';\n\nconst web3 = new Web3( /* ... blockchain provider ... */ );\nconst logEntryHash = web3.utils.sha3(JSON.stringify(logEntry));\n// ... store logEntryHash on the blockchain\n```\n\n\n**4. Multi-Agent Coordination with Socket.io:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  Coordinate multiple agents (access control agent, sanitization agent, LLM agent) in real-time.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * Use `Socket.io` to create a communication channel between agents.\n    * Agents can emit events (e.g., \"access_request,\" \"data_sanitized,\" \"llm_response\") and listen for relevant events to trigger actions.\n    * This enables dynamic, real-time interaction between agents, crucial for complex workflows.\n\n\n\n**JavaScript Libraries and Frameworks Summary:**\n\n* **`Casbin.js`:** ABAC implementation.\n* **Regular Expressions (built-in):** Regex-based redaction.\n* **`Hugging Face Transformers.js` / `node-bert`:** BERT-based PHI identification.\n* **`Hyperledger Fabric` / `Ethereum` / `web3.js`:** Blockchain integration for audit trails.\n* **`Socket.io`:** Real-time agent communication and coordination.\n\nBy incorporating these principles and tools, JavaScript developers can contribute to the advancement of HIPAA-compliant, secure, and efficient LLM-powered multi-agent applications in healthcare. Remember to always prioritize patient privacy and data security throughout the development process.  Continuously monitor and evaluate the performance of your system, particularly the PHI sanitization components, to maintain HIPAA compliance.",

Its purpose is to decide whether a given subject (e.g., a user or an agent) is allowed to perform a certain action on a specific object (e.g., access data) within a given environmental context.  It achieves this by evaluating access requests against a set of predefined policies, expressed as conditional statements using subject, object, action, and environment attributes.  If a matching policy is found, the PDA grants access and enforces any associated obligations (e.g., logging, data sanitization). Otherwise, access is denied. The provided JavaScript code simulates this process using helper functions to manage attributes, load policies, and evaluate conditions.  The `matchAttributes` function performs an initial check for quick authorization based on simple attribute matching, significantly optimizing the evaluation process for common access patterns. The policy loading and condition evaluation are delegated to dedicated helper functions to maintain code clarity and promote modularity. Note that these helper functions are placeholders and must be adapted to work with a real policy engine and data storage.  Crucially, the use of `eval()` in `evaluatePolicyCondition()` is for illustrative purposes only.  In a real-world application, a safer, more robust policy evaluation engine (e.g., using a dedicated parsing library or a purpose-built rules engine) is strongly recommended to mitigate potential security risks.  Furthermore, the example focuses on basic attribute matching and policy structure. Adapting it to handle complex policies, attribute data types, and obligation enforcement would likely necessitate a more sophisticated policy definition language and a dedicated obligation management module.",
