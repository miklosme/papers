  "title": "AIDE: Agentically Improve Visual Language Model with Domain Experts",
  "abstract": "The enhancement of Visual Language Models (VLMs) has traditionally relied on knowledge distillation from larger, more capable models. This dependence creates a fundamental bottleneck for improving state-of-the-art systems, particularly when no superior models exist. We introduce AIDE (Agentic Improvement through Domain Experts), a novel framework that enables VLMs to autonomously enhance their capabilities by leveraging specialized domain expert models. AIDE operates through a four-stage process: (1) identifying instances for refinement, (2) engaging domain experts for targeted analysis, (3) synthesizing expert outputs with existing data, and (4) integrating enhanced instances into the training pipeline. Experiments on multiple benchmarks, including MMMU, MME, MMBench, etc., demonstrate AIDE's ability to achieve notable performance gains without relying on larger VLMs nor human supervision. Our framework provides a scalable, resource-efficient approach to continuous VLM improvement, addressing critical limitations in current methodologies, particularly valuable when larger models are unavailable to access.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces AIDE (Agentic Improvement through Domain Experts), a framework for improving Visual Language Models (VLMs) by leveraging specialized external expert models (like OCR or object detection systems) instead of relying on larger, more general models for knowledge distillation. AIDE utilizes two agents: a \"Selector\" that identifies areas for improvement and chooses relevant expert models, and a \"Synthesizer\" that integrates expert outputs with existing data to create enhanced training examples. This multi-agent approach offers a more scalable and efficient way to improve VLMs, especially when larger teacher models are unavailable.  Key for LLM-based multi-agent systems is the demonstration of how independent agents with specialized skills (represented by the expert models) can collaboratively contribute to the improvement of a central LLM (the VLM).  The \"Selector\" agent embodies decision-making within the multi-agent system. This framework opens possibilities for similar agent-based improvement in other LLM applications.",
  "takeaways": "This research paper presents AIDE, a framework for improving Visual Language Models (VLMs) by leveraging specialized domain experts, offering valuable insights for JavaScript developers building LLM-based multi-agent web apps. Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights:\n\n**Practical Examples for JavaScript Developers:**\n\n1. **Building a Multi-Agent Content Creation Platform:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine building a platform where users can generate marketing copy and accompanying visuals.  A VLM agent drafts the copy, while specialized agents handle image selection, logo generation, and format optimization.\n* **AIDE Application:** Instead of relying solely on the VLM for image-related tasks, integrate specialized image processing APIs or libraries like OpenCV.js (a JavaScript version of OpenCV).  A \"Selector\" agent, implemented in JavaScript, can identify when image enhancements are necessary (e.g., cropping, resizing, style transfer).  It then invokes the appropriate expert agent. The \"Synthesizer\" agent, also in JavaScript, combines the VLM-generated text with the enhanced visuals to produce the final output.\n\n2. **Developing an Interactive E-commerce Shopping Assistant:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  An e-commerce site employs multiple agents: a VLM-based chatbot interacts with the user, a product recommendation agent suggests items, and a visual search agent allows users to find products using images.\n* **AIDE Application:**  Enhance the visual search agent's capabilities by integrating a specialized object detection model implemented using TensorFlow.js. The \"Selector\" agent, written in JavaScript, determines if the user's image requires object recognition (e.g., the user uploads a photo of a desired outfit).  It then invokes the object detection expert agent. The \"Synthesizer\" agent combines the identified objects with the product database to provide more accurate search results.\n\n3. **Creating a Collaborative Design Tool:**\n\n* **Scenario:** A multi-agent system for web design where a VLM agent interprets user instructions, a layout agent generates the webpage structure, and a styling agent applies CSS.\n* **AIDE Application:** Augment the styling agent with an expert agent that specializes in color palette generation, potentially using a JavaScript library like chroma.js. The \"Selector\" agent, based on the VLM's understanding of the user's design preferences, decides when to consult the color palette expert.  The \"Synthesizer\" agent combines the layout, the VLM-suggested styles, and the expert-generated color palette to create the final design.\n\n\n**JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries:**\n\n* **LangChain.js:** This framework is useful for building LLM-powered applications and could be used to integrate the VLM agent with other agents.\n* **TensorFlow.js/ONNX.js:**  Use these libraries for running machine learning models, like the specialized expert agents, directly in the browser.\n* **OpenCV.js:** Employ this library for image processing tasks performed by expert agents.\n* **Web Workers:**  Offload computationally intensive tasks of the expert agents to separate threads to avoid blocking the main thread and maintain application responsiveness.\n* **Node.js:** Use Node.js on the server-side to manage the interaction and coordination between multiple agents.\n\n\n**Key Takeaways for JavaScript Developers:**\n\n* **Modular Design:** Design your multi-agent systems with clearly defined roles for each agent. This makes integrating new expert agents easier.\n* **Asynchronous Communication:** Implement asynchronous communication patterns between agents using Promises or Async/Await to maintain performance.\n* **Data Pipelines:**  Establish clear data pipelines between the Selector, Expert agents, and Synthesizer to handle data flow efficiently.\n\n\nBy following these examples and leveraging the appropriate JavaScript frameworks, developers can build more robust, capable, and efficient multi-agent systems for various web development scenarios, realizing the practical potential of AIDE and similar multi-agent research.",
  "pseudocode": "No pseudocode block found. However, the paper describes the AIDE framework, which can be conceptually represented in JavaScript. While not a direct translation of pseudocode, the following JavaScript code demonstrates the core logic of AIDE:\n\n```javascript\nasync function aide(instance, selector, synthesizer, experts) {\n  // 1. Selection: Identify instances for refinement\n  const shouldRefine = await selector.shouldRefine(instance); \n\n  if (shouldRefine) {\n    let expertOutputs = {};\n\n    // 2. Execution: Invoke relevant expert models\n    for (const expertName in experts) {\n      if (selector.shouldUseExpert(instance, expertName)) {\n        expertOutputs[expertName] = await experts[expertName].analyze(instance);\n      }\n    }\n\n    // 3. Synthesis: Combine expert outputs with original data\n    const enhancedInstance = await synthesizer.synthesize(instance, expertOutputs);\n\n    // 4. Integration: Add enhanced instance to training data (with filtering)\n    if (filter(enhancedInstance)) {  // Implement your filtering logic\n      trainingData.push(enhancedInstance);\n    }\n    return enhancedInstance; // Return the enhanced data for inspection\n  }\n  return null; // No enhancement performed\n}\n\n// Example usage (simplified)\nconst instance = { image: '...', text: '...' };\nconst selector = new EagleSelector(); // Example selector using Eagle-8B\nconst synthesizer = new EagleSynthesizer(); // Example synthesizer using Eagle-8B\nconst experts = {\n  ocr: new PaddleOCR(),\n  segmentation: new GroundedSAM()\n};\n\nconst trainingData = []; // Initialize your training data array\nconst enhancedInstance = await aide(instance, selector, synthesizer, experts);\nif (enhancedInstance) {\n    console.log(\"Enhanced data example:\", enhancedInstance);\n}\n\n// ... Training loop using the enhanced trainingData\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **`aide(instance, selector, synthesizer, experts)`:** This is the main AIDE function. It takes an instance (e.g., image-text pair), a selector agent, a synthesizer agent, and a list of expert models as input.\n2. **`selector.shouldRefine(instance)`:** The selector determines if an instance needs refinement based on some criteria.\n3. **`selector.shouldUseExpert(instance, expertName)`:** The selector decides which expert to use for a given instance.\n4. **`experts[expertName].analyze(instance)`:** The chosen expert analyzes the instance and returns its output.\n5. **`synthesizer.synthesize(instance, expertOutputs)`:** The synthesizer combines the original instance and the expert outputs to generate an enhanced instance.\n6. **`filter(enhancedInstance)`:** A filter function ensures the quality and consistency of the enhanced data.\n7. **`trainingData.push(enhancedInstance)`:** The enhanced instance is added to the training dataset.\n\n**Purpose:**\n\nThis JavaScript code simulates the AIDE workflow described in the paper.  It aims to demonstrate how different components (selector, experts, synthesizer) interact to improve training data for a Visual Language Model (VLM). This is not production-ready code but a conceptual implementation for illustrative purposes.  Real-world implementations would require specific implementations of selectors, synthesizers, experts, and filtering logic, likely leveraging LLMs and potentially external APIs for specialized models.  The paper's central idea is to use smaller expert models to iteratively refine the VLM training data, circumventing the need for an even larger teacher model. This code provides a basic framework for experimenting with that approach.",
