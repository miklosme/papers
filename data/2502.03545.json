  "title": "Proportional Selection in Networks",
  "abstract": "We address the problem of selecting k representative nodes from a network, aiming to achieve two objectives: identifying the most influential nodes and ensuring the selection proportionally reflects the network's diversity. We propose two approaches to accomplish this, analyze them theoretically, and demonstrate their effectiveness through a series of experiments.",
  "summary": "This paper tackles the challenge of selecting a representative subset of nodes from a network, balancing influence (like PageRank or Katz centrality) with proportional representation of different groups within the network.  Two approaches are proposed: 1) adapting voting rules from social choice theory to network selection, and 2) an \"absorbing\" method where selected nodes no longer propagate influence, encouraging diverse selections.  The methods are analyzed theoretically and experimentally.\n\nFor LLM-based multi-agent systems, this research offers new ways to select influential agents while ensuring diverse perspectives are represented.  The proposed methods could help mitigate bias and improve fairness in multi-agent collaborations, especially when agents influence each other through communication or delegation. The concept of balancing individual agent influence with proportional representation is directly applicable to coordinating groups of LLMs and enhancing the fairness of group decisions.",
  "takeaways": "This research paper offers valuable insights for JavaScript developers working on LLM-based multi-agent applications, particularly regarding agent selection and group formation within a network. Here's how a developer could apply these insights in practical web development scenarios:\n\n**1. Social Networks & Community Formation:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  Imagine building a decentralized social network platform using JavaScript (e.g., with Node.js and a framework like Express.js or NestJS).  Users are nodes, and connections are edges. You want to recommend relevant groups or communities to users.\n* **Applying the Research:** Instead of simply suggesting groups based on shared keywords or basic graph metrics, you can use the MESRANK or BOSRANK algorithm.  These algorithms, adapted for JavaScript, can identify influential users and ensure proportional representation of different viewpoints within a community.  This leads to more diverse and potentially more engaging groups.\n* **Implementation:** You could create a JavaScript library implementing MESRANK/BOSRANK, taking a graph data structure (representing user connections) as input. This library could be integrated into your social network's backend to power community recommendations.\n\n**2. Collaborative Filtering & Recommendation Systems:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Developing a product recommendation system.  Products are nodes, and user interactions (purchases, reviews) form edges. You want to recommend products to users based on the preferences of similar users, but also ensuring diversity in the recommendations.\n* **Applying the Research:** Use ABSORBRANK adapted to JavaScript to identify influential products. By \"absorbing\" the influence of selected products, you can avoid over-recommending from the same product category, resulting in more diverse and potentially more appealing recommendations.\n* **Implementation:** Implement ABSORBRANK within your recommendation engine (potentially using libraries like TensorFlow.js for efficient graph processing) to select diverse \"seed\" products and then expand recommendations based on these seeds.\n\n**3. Multi-Agent Chatbots & Virtual Worlds:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Building a virtual world platform with multiple AI-powered chatbot agents (e.g., using a game engine like Babylon.js or Three.js with a natural language processing library). Agents form a network, communicating and collaborating with each other. You want to select representative agents for specific tasks or roles.\n* **Applying the Research:**  Employ MESKATZ or BOSKATZ to select a diverse group of agents for a task, ensuring that various perspectives and expertise are represented. This leads to more robust and well-rounded solutions in complex multi-agent tasks.\n* **Implementation:** Develop a JavaScript module calculating agent centralities (Katz or PageRank) and implementing MESKATZ/BOSKATZ. This module can be used to dynamically assign agents to tasks based on their influence and diversity within the agent network.\n\n**4. Content Moderation and Filtering:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  Developing a content moderation system for a forum or social platform (using Node.js and a database like MongoDB).  Users and content pieces are nodes; interactions like comments, shares, and reports form edges. You aim to identify key influencers spreading misinformation or harmful content.\n* **Applying the Research:** Use adapted versions of the algorithms from the paper (especially the absorbing rules) to pinpoint influential users within a network, even if they attempt to hide their influence by delegating or obscuring their connections.\n* **Implementation:**  Implement a graph-based analysis system using a JavaScript graph library and integrate it with your moderation pipeline.  The system can flag users selected by the algorithms for further review by human moderators.\n\n**Example JavaScript Snippet (Conceptual â€“ MESRANK):**\n\n```javascript\n// Simplified MESRANK implementation (requires a graph library)\nfunction mesrank(graph, k) {\n  const utilities = calculateUtilities(graph); // Function to calculate utilities between nodes\n  const selectedNodes = [];\n\n  // Implement the MES algorithm using the utility matrix \n  // ... (This part requires a full MES implementation which is out of scope for this example)\n\n  return selectedNodes;\n}\n\n// Example graph structure (using a hypothetical library)\nconst graph = new Graph();\ngraph.addNode(\"UserA\");\ngraph.addNode(\"UserB\");\ngraph.addEdge(\"UserA\", \"UserB\");\n// ... add more nodes and edges\n\nconst k = 5; // Number of nodes to select\nconst selected = mesrank(graph, k);\n\nconsole.log(\"Selected nodes:\", selected);\n```\n\n\nThese examples demonstrate how the research findings can be translated into real-world web development scenarios. JavaScript developers working on LLM-based multi-agent systems can leverage these concepts to build more sophisticated, balanced, and effective applications. Remember to consider the computational complexity of these algorithms and explore heuristics for larger datasets.  Leveraging existing JavaScript graph libraries (e.g., Cytoscape.js, vis.js, ngraph) will significantly simplify the implementation of these concepts.",
  "pseudocode": "Several algorithms are described in the paper, but they are presented in descriptive text rather than pseudocode blocks.  Therefore, I must interpret the descriptions and create the JavaScript code.\n\n**1. PageRank Calculation (Equation 1)**\n\n```javascript\nfunction pagerank(graph, alpha, iterations = 100) {\n  const numNodes = graph.length;\n  let pr = Array(numNodes).fill(1 / numNodes); // Initialize PageRank\n\n  for (let iter = 0; iter < iterations; iter++) {\n    const newPr = Array(numNodes).fill(0);\n    for (let u = 0; u < numNodes; u++) {\n      const outDegree = graph[u].length;\n      if (outDegree > 0) {\n        for (const v of graph[u]) {\n          newPr[v] += alpha * pr[u] / outDegree;\n        }\n      }\n      newPr[u] += (1-alpha) / numNodes;\n    }\n    pr = newPr;\n  }\n  return pr;\n}\n\n\n// Example graph represented as an adjacency list (directed graph)\nconst graph = [\n  [1, 2],  // Node 0 points to 1 and 2\n  [2],    // Node 1 points to 2\n  [],     // Node 2 points to nothing (a sink)\n  [0]     // Node 3 points to 0\n];\n\nconst alpha = 0.85;\nconst pageRanks = pagerank(graph, alpha);\nconsole.log(pageRanks);\n```\n\n* **Explanation:** This function calculates the PageRank of each node in a directed graph represented as an adjacency list. It iteratively updates the PageRank values based on the formula until convergence or a maximum number of iterations is reached.\n\n\n**2. Katz Centrality Calculation (Equation 2)**\n\n```javascript\nfunction katzCentrality(graph, alpha, iterations = 100) {\n  const numNodes = graph.length;\n  let katz = Array(numNodes).fill(0);\n\n  for (let iter = 0; iter < iterations; iter++) {\n    const newKatz = Array(numNodes).fill(0);\n\n     for (let u = 0; u < numNodes; u++){\n       newKatz[u] += 1\n     }\n\n    for (let u = 0; u < numNodes; u++) {      \n      for (const v of graph[u]) {\n        newKatz[v] += alpha * katz[u];\n      }\n    }\n    katz = newKatz;\n  }\n  return katz;\n}\n\n\n// Example graph (same as above)\nconst graph = [\n  [1, 2],\n  [2],\n  [],\n   [0]\n];\n\nconst alpha = 0.15; //  Example value\nconst katzValues = katzCentrality(graph, alpha);\nconsole.log(katzValues);\n```\n\n* **Explanation:** This function calculates Katz centrality using iterative updates, following a similar structure to the PageRank calculation.\n\n\n**3. Sequential Absorbing PageRank (SEQABSORBRANK)**\n\n```javascript\nfunction seqAbsorbRank(graph, k, alpha){\n  const n = graph.length;\n  let S = [];\n  let currentGraph = graph.map(arr => [...arr]); // Deep copy\n\n\n  for(let i=0; i < k; i++){\n      let bestNode = -1;\n      let bestScore = -Infinity;\n\n      for(let node=0; node < n; node++){\n        if (!S.includes(node)) {\n          const tempS = [...S, node];\n          const tempGraph = removeOutgoingEdges(currentGraph, tempS);\n          const prValues = pagerank(tempGraph, alpha);\n          const score = Math.min(...tempS.map(n => prValues[n]));\n          if (score > bestScore) {\n            bestScore = score;\n            bestNode = node;\n          }\n        }\n      }\n      S.push(bestNode);\n       currentGraph = removeOutgoingEdges(currentGraph, S);\n\n  }\n  return S;\n}\n\n\nfunction removeOutgoingEdges(graph, nodesToRemove) {\n  const newGraph = graph.map(arr => [...arr]); //Deep Copy\n   for (const node of nodesToRemove){\n     newGraph[node] = []\n   }\n  return newGraph;\n}\n\n\n// Example graph (same as above)\nconst graph = [\n    [1, 2],\n    [2],\n    [],\n    [0]\n];\n\nconst k = 2;\nconst alpha = 0.85;\nconst selectedNodes = seqAbsorbRank(graph, k, alpha);\n\nconsole.log(selectedNodes);\n\n\n```\n\n\n* **Explanation:**  `seqAbsorbRank` iteratively selects `k` nodes. In each iteration, it tries adding each possible node to the current set `S`. It calculates the PageRank on the graph with the outgoing edges of the temporary `S` removed. It selects the node that maximizes the minimum PageRank among nodes in `S`. The `removeOutgoingEdges` helper function creates a modified graph with specified outgoing edges removed.\n\n\nThese JavaScript implementations provide a functional basis for experimenting with the concepts described in the research paper. Remember that these are simplified versions.  For a true research-grade implementation, you'd need to consider optimizations, proper handling of edge cases, and potentially incorporate external libraries for graph data structures and algorithms. Additionally, the paper emphasizes proportionality as a key goal.  The MESRANK algorithm, although not translated to pseudocode here, would be the most relevant for pursuing that particular aim in practice, as it would require implementing a robust MES algorithm which isn't explicitly defined in pseudocode.",
