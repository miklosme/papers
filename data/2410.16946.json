  "title": "SELF-EVOLVING MULTI-AGENT COLLABORATION NET-\nWORKS FOR SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT",
  "abstract": "LLM-driven multi-agent collaboration (MAC) systems have demonstrated impressive capabilities in automatic software development at the function level. However, their heavy reliance on human design limits their adaptability to the diverse demands of real-world software development. To address this limitation, we introduce EvoMAC, a novel self-evolving paradigm for MAC networks. Inspired by traditional neural network training, EvoMAC obtains text-based environmental feedback by verifying the MAC network's output against a target proxy and leverages a novel textual backpropagation to update the network. To extend coding capabilities beyond function-level tasks to more challenging software-level development, we further propose rSDE-Bench, a requirement-oriented software development benchmark, which features complex and diverse software requirements along with automatic evaluation of requirement correctness. Our experiments show that: i) The automatic requirement-aware evaluation in rSDE-Bench closely aligns with human evaluations, validating its reliability as a software-level coding benchmark. ii) EvoMAC outperforms previous SOTA methods on both the software-level rSDE-Bench and the function-level HumanEval benchmarks, reflecting its superior coding capabilities. The benchmark can be downloaded at https://yuzhu-cai.github.io/rSDE-Bench/.",
  "summary": "This paper presents a novel self-evolving multi-agent collaboration network (EvoMAC) for software development. Inspired by neural networks, EvoMAC iteratively adapts its agents and connections during testing to improve code generation based on environmental feedback. Key points relevant to LLM-based multi-agent systems:\n\n* **Self-evolution:** EvoMAC uses a novel textual backpropagation algorithm to adjust agent prompts and workflow during test time based on feedback, enabling dynamic adaptation to task requirements.\n* **Requirement-oriented benchmark:** A new benchmark, rSDE-Bench, is introduced, featuring complex software requirements and automated evaluation, moving beyond function-level coding tasks. \n* **Effectiveness of multi-agent collaboration:** EvoMAC consistently outperforms single-agent and previous multi-agent systems, highlighting the power of collaboration and self-evolution in LLM-based systems.",
  "takeaways": "This paper introduces exciting possibilities for JavaScript developers working with LLMs in multi-agent systems, particularly in the realm of web development. Here's how you can apply its insights:\n\n**1. Self-Evolving Coding Agents for Web Apps**\n\nImagine building a web app with dynamic content requiring complex logic, like a personalized dashboard. \n\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** You can use a JavaScript LLM library like `langchain.js` to empower agents. Each agent specializes in a subtask:\n    * **Agent 1 (HTML Generation):** Takes user preferences as input and generates the initial HTML structure.\n    * **Agent 2 (CSS Styling):** Receives the generated HTML and applies dynamic CSS based on user preferences or device. \n    * **Agent 3 (JS Functionality):** Adds JavaScript interactions to the elements, like data fetching or event handling.\n\n* **EvoMAC in Action:**\n    * The agents collaborate and produce code iteratively, similar to the paper's coding team.\n    * Unit tests, created with frameworks like Jest or Jasmine, act as the \"target proxy,\" evaluating the generated code.\n    * A Node.js backend process can simulate the \"environment,\" running the tests and providing feedback. \n    * Based on the test results, a \"gradient agent,\" also powered by an LLM, analyzes errors and suggests improvements. These could be as specific as \"missing function call in `script.js`\" or \"incorrect CSS selector for element styling.\"\n    * An \"updating agent\" modifies the prompts of the coding agents. For example, if Agent 2 consistently fails to style a specific element, its prompt might be refined to include more context about that element's structure or intended appearance.\n\n**2. Requirement-Driven Development with LLMs**\n\nThe paper emphasizes the importance of detailed software requirements.  Let's say you are building an e-commerce site.\n\n* **Detailed Requirements:** Instead of vague instructions, provide LLMs with itemized requirements:\n    * \"Implement a product page with image carousel, customer reviews, and 'add to cart' functionality.\"\n    * \"The checkout process must integrate with Stripe API for secure payment processing.\"\n\n* **EvoMAC and JavaScript:**\n    * You can use LLMs to automatically generate unit tests (using a library like `jsdom` for DOM manipulation) from these detailed requirements.\n    * Libraries like `Puppeteer` or `Playwright` can be used by the \"environment\" to interact with the web app like a real user, providing richer feedback.\n    * The EvoMAC cycle ensures the generated code fulfills each specific requirement, leading to more robust and reliable web applications.\n\n**3. JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries**\n\n* **Langchain.js:**  Provides the building blocks for creating LLM-powered agents, managing chains of actions, and handling prompts.\n* **Jest/Jasmine:**  Crucial for writing unit tests that guide the self-evolution of your agents.\n* **jsdom:** Enables testing and manipulating the DOM in a Node.js environment, essential for web development scenarios.\n* **Puppeteer/Playwright:** Enable browser automation for more realistic user interaction simulations during testing.\n\n**Key Takeaways for JavaScript Developers**\n\n* **Shift in Mindset:** Embrace the power of LLMs for more than just code completion. Think about how they can drive entire development workflows.\n* **Detailed Requirements are Key:** The clearer and more specific your requirements, the better LLMs can understand and fulfill them.\n* **Embrace Automation:** Automate the testing and feedback loop as much as possible to enable continuous improvement of your LLM agents. \n\nBy combining the insights of this paper with the power of JavaScript and its ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, you can be at the forefront of building the next generation of intelligent, self-evolving web applications.",
  "pseudocode": "The provided text includes an algorithm described within the context of a research paper. However, it is not presented in a traditional \"pseudocode block\" format. Therefore, I cannot convert it directly into JavaScript. \n\nThe algorithm's steps are described in natural language within \"Algorithm 1: Self-Evolving Paradigm\" and further elaborated upon in section 8 of the paper. \n\nTo provide you with a JavaScript-like representation, I would need more specific instructions on how to structure the code. For example, you could ask me to:\n\n* Create a JavaScript class that implements the core logic of the self-evolving paradigm.\n* Define JavaScript functions for each step of the algorithm, using illustrative examples for the inputs and outputs.\n* Focus on a specific aspect of the algorithm, such as the textual backpropagation mechanism, and provide a JavaScript implementation for that part. \n\nPlease provide me with more specific instructions so I can generate useful JavaScript code for you.",
