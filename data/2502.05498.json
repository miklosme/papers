  "title": "Riemannian Manifold Learning for Stackelberg Games with Neural Flow Representations",
  "abstract": "We present a novel framework for online learning in Stackelberg general-sum games, where two agents, the leader and follower, engage in sequential turn-based interactions. At the core of this approach is a learned diffeomorphism that maps the joint action space to a smooth Riemannian manifold, referred to as the Stackelberg manifold. This mapping, facilitated by neural normalizing flows, ensures the formation of tractable isoplanar subspaces, enabling efficient techniques for online learning. By assuming linearity between the agents' reward functions on the Stackelberg manifold, our construct allows the application of standard bandit algorithms. We then provide a rigorous theoretical basis for regret minimization on convex manifolds and establish finite-time bounds on simple regret for learning Stackelberg equilibria. This integration of manifold learning into game theory uncovers a previously unrecognized potential for neural normalizing flows as an effective tool for multi-agent learning. We present empirical results demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach compared to standard baselines, with applications spanning domains such as cybersecurity and economic supply chain optimization.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces a new method for training AI agents to play Stackelberg games, where one agent (the leader) acts first, and the other (the follower) responds. The core idea is to simplify the game by mapping the possible actions of both agents onto a spherical surface called the \"Stackelberg manifold\" using a type of neural network called a normalizing flow. This simplifies the problem by allowing the leader to anticipate the follower's optimal actions and reduce the complexity of coordinating strategies.\n\nFor LLM-based multi-agent systems, this research suggests a way to improve the efficiency and performance of agents in conversational settings or other hierarchical interactions. By learning a simplified representation of the interaction space, LLMs could better anticipate user responses and optimize their own actions, leading to more natural and effective communication. This method addresses the challenge of uncertainty in how users might respond, a key aspect of real-world interactions with LLMs.  The concept of using a learned manifold could also be applied to other multi-agent scenarios involving LLMs beyond just conversational agents.",
  "takeaways": "This paper introduces a novel approach to optimizing Stackelberg games using Riemannian manifold learning and neural normalizing flows, which has exciting potential applications for LLM-based multi-agent systems in web development. Here are some practical examples for JavaScript developers:\n\n**1. Collaborative Content Creation:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine a web app where multiple LLMs collaborate to write a story. One LLM acts as the leader, setting the plot direction, and others act as followers, generating text based on the leader's input.\n* **Application:**  The GISA algorithm can optimize the leader's \"plot moves\" to maximize story coherence and engagement, learning from user feedback (e.g., ratings, comments). The leader's actions could be high-level plot points, and the followers' actions could be sentences or paragraphs.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * **Frontend:**  A React or Vue.js frontend could handle user interaction and display the generated story.\n    * **Backend:**  A Node.js backend could host the LLMs and implement the GISA algorithm. TensorFlow.js could be used to implement the neural normalizing flow.  Communication between agents can be facilitated by a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ) or a real-time framework like Socket.IO.\n    * **Library:**  LangChain.js can manage interactions with LLMs and provide tools for prompt engineering.\n\n**2. Interactive Game Design:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Develop a web-based game where an LLM acts as a game master, adapting the game's difficulty and narrative based on the actions of multiple human players (followers).\n* **Application:** The GISA algorithm can optimize the game master's actions (e.g., introducing new challenges, adjusting enemy AI) to maintain optimal player engagement and challenge.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * **Frontend:**  A Phaser.js or Babylon.js frontend could handle the game's graphics and user input.\n    * **Backend:** Similar to the previous example, a Node.js backend could host the LLM and implement the GISA algorithm.\n    * **Library:**  Game development libraries like Lance.gg could handle the multiplayer aspects.\n\n**3. Personalized Recommendation Systems:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  Build a recommendation system where one LLM acts as a leader, recommending products or content, and another LLM acts as a follower, generating personalized explanations for the recommendations based on user profiles.\n* **Application:** The GISA algorithm can optimize the leader's recommendations to maximize click-through rates or purchase conversions, learning from user interactions.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * **Frontend:**  Any modern JavaScript framework could handle displaying recommendations and user interactions.\n    * **Backend:** A Node.js backend could run the LLMs and the GISA algorithm.\n\n**4. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs):**\n\n* **Scenario:** Design a DAO where LLMs act as agents proposing and voting on governance decisions. One LLM might act as a leader, proposing initiatives, while others act as followers, evaluating and voting on the proposals.\n* **Application:**  The GISA algorithm could be used to optimize the leader's proposals to maximize the likelihood of approval by the follower LLMs, considering their individual \"preferences\" (learned through training).\n* **Implementation:**\n    * **Smart Contracts:** Solidity smart contracts could govern the voting process and token distribution.\n    * **Off-Chain Logic:** A Node.js backend could host the LLMs and implement the GISA algorithm. Web3.js could interact with the smart contracts.\n\n\n**Key JavaScript Technologies and Libraries:**\n\n* **LLM Interaction:** LangChain.js\n* **Neural Networks:** TensorFlow.js, Brain.js\n* **Frontend Frameworks:** React, Vue.js, Angular\n* **Backend Frameworks:** Node.js, Express.js\n* **Game Development:** Phaser.js, Babylon.js, Lance.gg\n* **Real-time Communication:** Socket.IO\n* **Web3 Integration:** Web3.js, Ethers.js\n\nBy understanding the principles of Riemannian manifold learning and the GISA algorithm, JavaScript developers can create innovative LLM-based multi-agent applications that adapt and optimize their behavior in complex web environments. These examples merely scratch the surface of the potential applications, and we can expect to see many more exciting developments in this field in the coming years.",

It aims to find the optimal action for a leader agent in a Stackelberg game by leveraging the properties of the Stackelberg manifold. It alternates between exploration (sampling actions from the boundary of the confidence ball) and exploitation (choosing actions that minimize the geodesic distance to the follower's anticipated optimal response).\n\n**Algorithm 2 (Spherical to Cartesian):** This function converts spherical coordinates to Cartesian coordinates in n-dimensional space.  It's a utility function used within the GISA algorithm to work with data represented on the spherical manifold.\n\n**Algorithm 3 (Cartesian to Spherical):**  This function converts Cartesian coordinates to spherical coordinates. It's the inverse of Algorithm 2 and is also used by the GISA algorithm for transformations between the ambient space and the manifold.\n\n**Algorithm 4 (Newsvendor Learning):** This algorithm, taken from [LR24], is used as a baseline comparison in the Newsvendor Pricing Game experiments. It's a specific algorithm designed for a two-player Stackelberg game scenario involving a supplier and a retailer. It demonstrates the standard approach before the manifold-based optimization introduced by the paper.  Note that this pseudocode omits certain details present in the original paper because the purpose is to use it as a benchmark in their experimental setup, not to implement the Newsvendor algorithm itself.\n\n\nPlease note that the provided JavaScript code is a simplified implementation for illustrative purposes and would require further details (e.g. implementation of helper functions like `createStackelbergEmbedding`, `sampleFromConfidenceBallBoundary`, `minimizeGeodesicDistance`, `getRewards`, `updateTheta`, `calculateConfidenceInterval`, `argmax_a`, `f1`, `calculateOptimisticParamsAndBestResponse` and `d` ) to be fully functional. The core structure and logic, however, align with the algorithms described in the research paper.",
