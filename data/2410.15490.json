  "title": "Dynamic Intelligence Assessment: Benchmarking LLMs on the Road to AGI with a Focus on Model Confidence",
  "abstract": "Abstract-As machine intelligence evolves, the need to test and compare the problem-solving abilities of different AI models grows. However, current benchmarks are often overly simplistic, allowing models to perform uniformly well and, making it difficult to distinguish their capabilities. Additionally, benchmarks typically rely on static question-answer pairs, which models might memorize or guess. To address these limitations, we introduce the Dynamic Intelligence Assessment (DIA), a novel methodology for testing AI models using dynamic question templates and improved metrics across multiple disciplines such as mathematics, cryptography, cybersecurity, and computer science. The accompanying DIA-Bench dataset, which includes 150 diverse and challenging task templates with mutable parameters, is presented in various formats (text, PDFs, compiled binaries, and visual puzzles). Our framework introduces four new metrics to assess a model's reliability and confidence across multiple attempts. These metrics revealed that even simple questions are frequently answered incorrectly when posed in varying forms, highlighting significant gaps in models' reliability. Notably, models like GPT-40 tended to overestimate their mathematical abilities, while ChatGPT-40 demonstrated better decision-making and performance through effective tool usage. We evaluated eight state-of-the-art LLMs using DIA-Bench, showing that current models struggle with complex tasks and often display unexpectedly low confidence, even with simpler questions. The DIA framework sets a new standard for assessing not only problem-solving but also a model's adaptive intelligence and ability to assess its own limitations. The dataset is publicly available on our project's website. https://github.com/DIA-Bench",
  "summary": "1. This paper introduces a new method, called Dynamic Intelligence Assessment (DIA), for evaluating the reliability and confidence of large language models (LLMs) when answering complex questions. They created a benchmark dataset with many challenging tasks to test LLMs and see how well they perform, especially when asked to solve variations of similar problems. \n\n2. Key points:\n    * Current ways of evaluating LLMs are too simple and don't accurately reflect how well they can solve problems consistently. \n    * LLMs are better at \"pattern matching\" than actual reasoning, often failing when a question is asked in a slightly different way.\n    *  LLMs often struggle to assess their own limitations, attempting tasks they are not equipped to handle, especially without access to tools. \n    * This research highlights the importance of building LLMs that can reliably solve different types of problems and accurately know when they can't solve something, which is crucial for building trustworthy multi-agent systems.",
  "takeaways": "This paper offers some really interesting points for JavaScript developers building LLM-powered multi-agent systems for the web. Here's how you can apply its insights:\n\n**1. Building Reliable Agent Interactions**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine building a collaborative web app for project management where multiple AI agents, each representing a team member, interact to schedule tasks, allocate resources, and even draft communications.\n* **Problem:**  Current benchmarks often rely on a single attempt, leading to a false sense of capability. An agent might correctly solve a problem once but fail on slight variations.\n* **Solution:**  Incorporate the paper's \"Dynamic Intelligence Assessment\" (DIA) principles:\n    * **Dynamic Task Generation:** Use JavaScript to create variations of common tasks. For example, instead of \"Schedule a meeting for tomorrow at 3 PM,\" generate variations like \"Find a 1-hour slot for a meeting tomorrow with John and Sarah.\"\n    * **Reliability Score:**  Don't just track if an agent succeeded. Implement a reliability score (as described in the paper) in your JavaScript code. Penalize incorrect or hallucinated responses more heavily. This highlights agents prone to errors, even if they sometimes succeed.\n    * **Confidence Index:** Track how often an agent confidently completes *all* variations of a task.  A high confidence index means you can rely on the agent for that task category.\n\n**2.  Leveraging Tools (and Knowing When to Skip)**\n\n* **Scenario:**  You're building a customer support chatbot system. The agents need to access a knowledge base, potentially run database queries, or even trigger external actions like refunds. \n* **Problem:**  LLMs without tool-using abilities will try to hallucinate answers when they should be delegating or asking for help.\n* **Solution:**\n    * **Tool-Aware Agents:**  Use frameworks like Langchain ([https://js.langchain.com/docs/](https://js.langchain.com/docs/)) or LlamaIndex ([https://llamaindex.ai/](https://llamaindex.ai/)) to empower your agents with tool access. This lets them make API calls, run code, or query external data.\n    * **\"I Don't Know\" is Powerful:**  The paper shows that even the best LLMs struggle with self-assessment.  Build in explicit logic: If an agent's confidence score is below a threshold, train it to respond with \"I'm not sure, let me find more information\" or escalate to a human agent.\n\n**3. Experimenting with JavaScript Libraries**\n\n* **Langchain.js / LlamaIndex:**  These libraries are great for prototyping multi-agent systems and integrating external tools. \n* **TensorFlow.js:**  If you need more control over model fine-tuning or want to experiment with on-device inference for agents, TensorFlow.js is a powerful option.\n* **Web Workers:** For computationally intensive agent logic, offload processing to separate threads using Web Workers to maintain a responsive UI.\n\n**Code Example (Conceptual - using Langchain.js):**\n\n```javascript\nimport { OpenAI } from \"langchain/llms/openai\";\nimport { Calculator } from \"langchain/tools/calculator\";\n\nconst model = new OpenAI({ temperature: 0 }); // Lower temp = more deterministic\n\nconst calculatorTool = new Calculator();\n\nconst runAgent = async (task) => {\n  // 1. DYNAMIC TASK: (Generate variations of 'task' here) \n  // ...\n\n  const response = await model.call(task, [calculatorTool]); // Pass in tools\n\n  // 2. RELIABILITY: (Implement your scoring logic)\n  const score = calculateReliability(response, expectedAnswer);\n\n  // 3. CONFIDENCE & SKIPPING:\n  if (score < 0.8) { \n    return \"I'm not sure about that. Can I get more information?\";\n  } \n\n  return response;\n}\n```\n\n**Key Takeaways for JavaScript Developers**\n\n* **Reliability over One-Shot Success:**  Don't be fooled by benchmarks showing high accuracy on single attempts. Focus on consistent, reliable problem-solving by your agents.\n* **Tools are Essential:**  Empower your agents with the ability to use tools, just as humans do, to interact with your web application and the wider world.\n* **Self-Awareness is Key (and Difficult):** Train agents to recognize their limitations and when to ask for help or escalate to a human.\n\nThis paper is a call to action for building more robust, reliable, and practically useful multi-agent AI applications, especially in the context of web development.",
