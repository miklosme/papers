  "title": "Single-Agent Planning in a Multi-Agent System: A Unified Framework for Type-Based Planners",
  "abstract": "We consider a general problem where an agent is in a multi-agent environment and must plan for herself without any prior information about her opponents. At each moment, this pivotal agent is faced with a trade-off between exploiting her currently accumulated information about the other agents and exploring further to improve future (re-)planning. We propose a theoretic framework that unifies a spectrum of planners for the pivotal agent to address this trade-off. The planner at one end of this spectrum aims to find exact solutions, while those towards the other end yield approximate solutions as the problem scales up. Beyond theoretical analysis, we also implement 13 planners and conduct experiments in a specific domain called multi-agent route planning with the number of agents up to 50, to compare their performances in various scenarios. One interesting observation comes from a class of planners that we call safe-agents and their enhanced variants by incorporating domain-specific knowledge, which is a simple special case under the proposed general framework, but performs sufficiently well in most cases. Our unified framework, as well as those induced planners, provides new insights on multi-agent decision-making, with potential applications to related areas such as mechanism design.",
  "summary": "This paper proposes a unified framework for single-agent planning in multi-agent systems where the agent has no prior information about its opponents.  It focuses on the trade-off between exploiting known information and exploring to gain more. The framework unifies various planning approaches, from exact solutions (like POMDPs) to approximations (like belief-based MDPs and Monte Carlo Tree Search), allowing for scalability in complex environments.\n\n\nKey points for LLM-based multi-agent systems:\n\n* **Opponent Modeling:** The framework uses type-based reasoning, where opponent strategies are represented as types (predefined models). This is relevant to LLMs, which can be used to learn and represent these opponent types.\n* **Belief Updates:**  The system maintains a belief over possible opponent types and updates it based on observed actions. LLMs can facilitate more nuanced belief updates by incorporating richer contextual information and reasoning about opponent motivations.\n* **Planning with Uncertainty:**  The framework addresses the challenge of planning in partially observable environments with unknown opponent strategies. LLMs can enhance planning by generating diverse hypothetical scenarios and predicting opponent actions.\n* **Scalability:** The proposed framework unifies a range of planners with different levels of complexity, enabling developers to choose an approach that balances performance and computational cost. This is crucial for LLM-based agents, which can be computationally expensive.\n* **Safe Agents:** The paper highlights \"safe agents,\" which prioritize avoiding collisions, as a simple yet effective strategy, particularly in complex scenarios.  This concept can be incorporated into LLM-based agents to ensure robust and safe behavior.\n* **Potential for Hybrid Approaches:**  The framework suggests using learned models (like those from RL) or Nash Equilibrium solvers as heuristics within the tree search. This opens up possibilities for hybrid approaches combining LLMs with other AI techniques.  For instance, an LLM can generate initial strategies, which are then refined using tree search guided by an NE solver.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents a unified framework for single-agent planning in multi-agent systems, particularly relevant for JavaScript developers working with LLM-based multi-agent web apps.  Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply its insights:\n\n**1. Building Interactive Narratives/Storytelling:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine a collaborative storytelling web app where users and LLMs interact as characters, shaping a dynamic narrative.\n* **Application:** Use the \"safe-agent\" concept. Each LLM-powered character can be a safe-agent, prioritizing narrative consistency (avoiding plot holes, character contradictions) over maximizing individual narrative impact. This could be implemented using a rule-based system in JavaScript, checking proposed narrative actions against pre-defined constraints before submitting them to the shared story space. This ensures a smoother, more coherent story evolution, even with multiple LLMs contributing.  Libraries like `json-rules-engine` can manage the rule sets.\n\n**2. Collaborative Design Tools:**\n\n* **Scenario:** A web app for collaborative design (e.g., UI design, architectural planning) where LLMs assist users by suggesting design elements, ensuring consistency, and handling layout.\n* **Application:** Implement the belief-update mechanism using a JavaScript library like TensorFlow.js or Brain.js. As users and LLMs interact (e.g., placing elements, suggesting changes), the system updates its belief about each agent's design preferences.  This allows the system to make more informed suggestions, anticipating user needs and maintaining design coherence across multiple contributors.\n\n**3. Real-time Strategy Games:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Browser-based real-time strategy games where LLMs control some or all of the opposing factions.\n* **Application:** Implement the \"belief-mixed MDP (QMDP)\" approach.  Pre-train LLM agents with different strategies (aggressive, defensive, economic focus, etc.).  During gameplay, the player's client-side JavaScript code can use a simplified belief model (based on observed opponent actions) to estimate the likelihood of each opponent using each strategy. Then, it can select actions based on pre-calculated best responses to the mixed belief, creating more dynamic and challenging opponents.\n\n**4. Chatbots and Virtual Assistants:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  A multi-agent system where chatbots and virtual assistants cooperate to handle complex user requests in a web application.\n* **Application:** Use the unified framework's tree search principle. When a user request requires multiple agents (e.g., booking a flight and reserving a hotel), a coordinating agent can perform a limited-depth tree search (implemented in client-side JavaScript) to evaluate possible action sequences and select the best plan based on predicted user satisfaction.  This approach is more adaptable than pre-defined workflows and handles unexpected situations better.\n\n**5. Decentralized Marketplaces:**\n\n* **Scenario:** A peer-to-peer marketplace built on web technologies, where LLM-powered agents negotiate prices and manage transactions.\n* **Application:** Implement a simplified version of the paper's framework where agents (running JavaScript code in users' browsers) can perform local tree search to explore potential negotiation strategies before making offers.  By considering opponent models (beliefs about other agents' preferences), agents can negotiate more effectively than simple reactive strategies.\n\n\n**JavaScript Frameworks/Libraries:**\n\n* **TensorFlow.js/Brain.js:**  For implementing belief updates and other machine learning components.\n* **LangChain/LlamaIndex:** For integrating and managing LLMs.\n* **json-rules-engine:** For implementing rule-based safe-agents.\n* **Web Workers:** For offloading computationally intensive tasks (like tree search) to background threads, maintaining UI responsiveness.\n\n**Example (simplified belief update with TensorFlow.js):**\n\n```javascript\n// Simplified example - assumes agent actions are discrete (0, 1, 2...)\n// and belief is a probability distribution over those actions.\n\nimport * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';\n\n// Initial belief (uniform)\nlet belief = tf.ones([numActions]).div(numActions);\n\nfunction updateBelief(observedAction) {\n  // Increase probability of observed action (simplified update)\n  const learningRate = 0.1;\n  const updatedProb = belief.gather(observedAction).add(learningRate); \n  belief = belief.mul(1 - learningRate); // Decrease other probabilities\n  belief = belief.scatterND([[observedAction]], [updatedProb]); // Update specific action\n\n  belief = belief.div(belief.sum()); // Normalize\n}\n\n\n// Example usage\nupdateBelief(1); // Observed agent took action 1\nconsole.log(belief.arraySync()); // Updated belief\n```\n\nBy combining the theoretical insights of this paper with readily available JavaScript tools, developers can build sophisticated multi-agent web applications with enhanced interactivity and intelligence.  This framework offers a practical path to incorporating cutting-edge AI research into real-world web development projects.",

Each algorithm represents a different approach to handling uncertainty about the other agents.\n\n* **Algorithm 1 (planBeliefFixed):**  This is the simplest approach. The agent forms an initial belief about opponent strategies and induces a Markov Decision Process (MDP) based on this belief. It then solves this MDP to find an optimal policy and sticks to this policy throughout the interaction, even if observations suggest the initial belief was incorrect.  This is computationally inexpensive but can lead to suboptimal outcomes if the initial belief is inaccurate.\n\n* **Algorithm 2 (planBeliefUpdated):** This algorithm improves on the previous one by updating the belief about opponent strategies after every observation. At each step, the agent updates its belief, induces a new MDP based on this updated belief, solves the MDP for a new policy, and acts according to the new policy. This is more computationally expensive than `planBeliefFixed` but can lead to better performance as the agent adapts to new information.\n\n* **Algorithm 3 (planQMDP):**  This algorithm computes the optimal Q-values for each possible opponent strategy upfront. At each step, it uses the current belief distribution over opponent strategies to compute a weighted average of the Q-values and chooses the action with the highest expected value. This is more computationally expensive than the previous two algorithms, especially upfront.\n\n* **Algorithm 4 (planContextualRL):**  This algorithm uses contextual reinforcement learning to train an agent that takes both the current state and the belief distribution as input. This approach allows the agent to learn complex relationships between beliefs and optimal actions. This is typically the most computationally expensive approach due to the training process but has the potential to achieve the best performance.\n\n* **Algorithm 5 (planTS):** This algorithm uses a look-ahead tree search to plan. At each step, it performs a tree search to evaluate possible future outcomes, considering different actions and possible opponent responses. This approach balances exploration and exploitation and can be adapted to different computational budgets by controlling the depth of the search.  Algorithms 6 and 7 are helper functions for Algorithm 5, providing specific tree search implementations.\n\n\nAlgorithms 1-4 exemplify different ways to manage uncertainty in multi-agent environments.  Algorithm 5 and its helpers show how tree search can be employed for planning with beliefs. The choice of algorithm depends on the specific problem, available computational resources, and desired performance level.",
