  "title": "ROMAS: A Role-Based Multi-Agent System for Database monitoring and Planning",
  "abstract": "In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in data analytics when integrated with Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). However, these systems often struggle with complex tasks that involve diverse functional requirements and intricate data processing challenges, necessitating customized solutions that lack broad applicability. Furthermore, current MAS fail to emulate essential human-like traits such as self-planning, self-monitoring, and collaborative work in dynamic environments, leading to inefficiencies and resource wastage. To address these limitations, we propose ROMAS, a novel Role-Based Multi-Agent System designed to adapt to various scenarios while enabling low code development and one-click deployment. ROMAS has been effectively deployed in DB-GPT [Xue et al., 2023a, 2024b], a well-known project utilizing LLM-powered database analytics, showcasing its practical utility in real-world scenarios. By integrating role-based collaborative mechanisms for self-monitoring and self-planning, and leveraging existing MAS capabilities to enhance database interactions, ROMAS offers a more effective and versatile solution. Experimental evaluations of ROMAS demonstrate its superiority across multiple scenarios, highlighting its potential to advance the field of multi-agent data analytics.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces ROMAS, a new role-based multi-agent system for database monitoring and planning within the DB-GPT framework. ROMAS uses LLMs and assigns agents specific roles (planner, monitor, worker) to improve flexibility, self-monitoring, self-planning, and collaboration in complex data analysis tasks. Key features relevant to LLM-based multi-agent systems include role-based collaboration, self-reflection/planning mechanisms, low-code development within DB-GPT, enhanced database interaction, and the use of memory, error handling, and gap-narrowing strategies for optimized performance.  It's tested on financial and general knowledge question answering datasets showing improvements over other LLM and Multi-agent approaches.",
  "takeaways": "This paper introduces ROMAS, a role-based multi-agent system for database monitoring and planning, and its implementation within the DB-GPT framework. Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights to LLM-based multi-agent AI projects, focusing on web development scenarios:\n\n**1. Role-Based Agent Architecture:**\n\n* **Concept:**  ROMAS assigns distinct roles to agents (Planner, Monitor, Worker/Tasker/Retriever/Extractor/Painter) for specialized tasks, improving organization and efficiency.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * Use classes or objects to define agent roles, each with specific methods corresponding to their tasks. For instance, a `Planner` class might have methods like `createPlan()`, `assignTasks()`, and a `Monitor` class could have `monitorProgress()`, `handleError()`.\n    * Consider using a message broker (like Redis or RabbitMQ, accessible via Node.js libraries) for inter-agent communication, reflecting the message queues in ROMAS.  Each agent can subscribe to relevant topics for task assignments or error alerts.\n\n```javascript\n// Example: Planner Agent\nclass Planner {\n  constructor(llm) {\n    this.llm = llm; \n  }\n\n  async createPlan(goal, constraints, resources) {\n    // Use this.llm to generate a plan based on goal, constraints, resources \n    // ...\n    return plan;\n  }\n\n  async assignTasks(plan, workers) {\n    // Assign tasks from the plan to available worker agents\n    // Use message broker to publish task assignments\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n\n\n// Example: Worker Agent (Tasker)\nclass Tasker {\n  constructor(llm) {\n    this.llm = llm;\n  }\n\n   async executeTask(task) {\n    // Use this.llm to execute the received task\n    // ... \n    // Publish results/errors through the message broker\n   }\n}\n\n// ... other agent classes (Monitor, Retriever, etc.)\n```\n\n**2. Self-Monitoring and Self-Planning:**\n\n* **Concept:** Agents evaluate their own performance and adjust actions dynamically, improving robustness and adaptability.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * Implement methods within each agent class for self-reflection. For example, after completing a task, a `Tasker` agent could call `selfReflect(results)` which uses the LLM to assess the quality of the results and potentially trigger retries or alternative approaches.\n    * Use performance metrics (e.g., task completion time, error rate) collected during execution to inform self-planning and resource allocation.\n\n```javascript\n// Example self-reflection in Tasker agent\nasync selfReflect(results) {\n  const evaluation = await this.llm.evaluate(results, taskDescription); // LLM evaluates results\n  if (evaluation.quality < threshold) {\n   // Retry task or adjust approach\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n**3. Low-Code Development & Deployment:**\n\n* **Concept:**  ROMAS aims for simplified development and deployment within the DB-GPT framework.  While DB-GPT is not directly JavaScript-based, its principles can be adopted.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * Create modular, reusable components for agent functionality.  Consider using a component-based UI framework (React, Vue, Angular) to build a user interface for managing and interacting with your multi-agent system.\n    * Leverage serverless functions or containerization for easy deployment and scaling of agents.\n\n\n**4. Enhanced Database Interactions (Inspired by DB-GPT):**\n\n* **Concept:** ROMAS optimizes database interactions.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * Use efficient database libraries (e.g., Prisma, TypeORM, Mongoose if using MongoDB) in your Node.js backend to manage database operations performed by agents.\n    * Implement caching strategies to minimize database load and improve response times.\n\n\n**Web Development Scenarios:**\n\n* **Dynamic Content Generation:** Agents can collaborate to personalize website content based on user behavior and preferences.  A Planner agent could determine content strategy, Retriever agents gather information, and Painter agents generate the final HTML.\n* **Chatbots and Customer Support:**  Implement a multi-agent chat system where a Dispatcher agent assigns user requests to specialized support agents based on the type of query.\n* **Real-time Data Analysis and Visualization:** Monitor agents could track website traffic or application usage data.  A Planner agent could then dynamically adjust resource allocation based on demand or trigger alerts if anomalies are detected.\n\n\n**JavaScript Libraries and Frameworks:**\n\n* **LLM Integration:** `langchain.js` for easier access to LLMs.\n* **Message Brokers:**  Node.js libraries for Redis, RabbitMQ, or Kafka.\n* **UI Frameworks:** React, Vue, Angular for building interfaces.\n* **Database Libraries:** Prisma, TypeORM, Mongoose.\n\n\nBy adopting these strategies and leveraging the power of JavaScript and its ecosystem, developers can translate the theoretical concepts from the ROMAS paper into practical and impactful web applications powered by multi-agent LLM systems. Remember that these implementations offer starting points, and further exploration, experimentation, and refinement based on your specific project requirements will be essential.",

Its purpose is to generate a new, optimized strategy (`Sopt`) based on the current system's state, feedback from the monitor, and the previous strategy.\n\n1. **New Strategy Generation:**  An LLM generates an initial new strategy (`Snew`) considering the global state (`G`), recommendations from the monitor (`R`), the user query (`Q`), the old strategy (`Sold`), and the scenario prompt (`P`).\n\n2. **Difference Computation:**  The algorithm then uses the LLM to identify the specific differences (`D`) between the new strategy (`Snew`) and the old strategy (`Sold`).\n\n3. **Prerequisite Application and Regeneration:** A set of predefined rules or prerequisites (`R`) are applied to each difference (`di`).  If a difference violates a prerequisite, it's regenerated by the LLM, incorporating the global state and other relevant information.  This iterative process aims to minimize modifications to the old strategy and ensure consistency.  The function `reflectAndCheckImprovement` assesses whether the new difference contributes to an actual improvement over the old strategy.  If not, all the differences are regenerated.\n\n4. **Integration and Optimization:** Finally, the individually corrected differences are integrated into the new strategy to form the final optimized strategy (`Sopt`), which is then returned.\n\n\nThis JavaScript code provides a structural representation of the pseudocode algorithm.  To make it fully functional, you'd need to replace the placeholder functions with actual implementations that interact with your LLM, manage strategy representation, implement prerequisite rules, and evaluate strategy improvement.  Furthermore, error handling, memory management, and context limitations as mentioned in the paper should also be taken into account for real-world application.",
