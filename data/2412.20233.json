  "title": "Decentralized Unlabeled Multi-Agent Navigation in Continuous Space",
  "abstract": "Abstract. In this work, we study the problem where a group of mobile agents needs to reach a set of goal locations, but it does not matter which agent reaches a specific goal. Unlike most of the existing works on this topic that typically assume the existence of the centralized planner (or controller) and limit the agents' moves to a predefined graph of locations and transitions between them, in this work we focus on the decentralized scenarios, when each agent acts individually relying only on local observations/communications and is free to move in arbitrary direction at any time. Our iterative approach involves agents individually selecting goals, exchanging them, planning paths, and at each time step choose actions that balance between progressing along the paths and avoiding collisions. The proposed method is shown to be complete under specific assumptions on how agents progress towards their current goals, and our empirical evaluation demonstrates its superiority over a baseline decentralized navigation approach in success rate (i.e. is able to solve more problem instances under a given time limit) and a comparison with the centralized TSWAP algorithm reveals its efficiency in minimizing trajectory lengths for mission accomplishment.",
  "summary": "This paper tackles the problem of coordinating multiple agents to reach target destinations without collisions, *without pre-assigned agent-goal pairings*.  Agents operate in a continuous space, using local communication and observation. A key contribution is a decentralized goal-exchanging mechanism, allowing agents to dynamically re-assign goals based on local information for better efficiency and collision avoidance. This method shows promising results compared to centralized approaches and other decentralized methods, particularly in complex environments.  While not explicitly using LLMs, the decentralized, communicative, and dynamic nature of the goal assignment mechanism is relevant to LLM-based multi-agent systems, which often involve similar coordination and negotiation among agents. This research provides insights into effective decentralized control strategies that can be adapted for LLM agents needing flexible and robust coordination.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents a decentralized approach to multi-agent navigation, particularly relevant for LLM-based multi-agent applications in web development. Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights:\n\n**1. Decentralized Coordination in Browser-Based Multi-Agent Simulations:**\n\nImagine building a real-time strategy game in the browser where multiple units (agents) controlled by LLMs need to navigate a map, collect resources, and engage in combat. This paper's decentralized approach, using local communication and individual pathfinding, translates well into a browser environment.\n\n* **Agents as JS Objects:** Each agent can be represented as a JavaScript object with properties like position, goal, velocity, and an LLM instance for decision-making.\n* **Local Communication with WebSockets or Shared State:**  Simulate local communication using WebSockets for real-time updates or a shared state management library like Redux for turn-based interactions.  The `goalUpdate` logic from the paper can be adapted to resolve goal conflicts based on agent priorities (e.g., unit type).\n* **Pathfinding with JavaScript Libraries:** Integrate a JavaScript pathfinding library like PathFinding.js or EasyStar.js.  The `constructPath` function from the paper maps directly to these libraries.\n* **Collision Avoidance with ORCA.js:**  Adapt ORCA (Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance) for JavaScript to handle collision avoidance in real-time, implementing the `computeAction` function.\n* **Visualization with Canvas or WebGL:** Use HTML5 Canvas or WebGL for visualizing the agents and their movements.\n\n**Example Code Snippet (Conceptual):**\n\n```javascript\n// Agent object\nclass Agent {\n  constructor(id, position, llm) {\n    this.id = id;\n    this.position = position;\n    this.goal = null;\n    this.llm = llm; // LLM instance\n  }\n\n  async update(neighboringAgents, goals) {\n    // ... Implement goalUpdate logic (Algorithm 2 from the paper) ...\n\n    this.goal = newGoal;\n    this.path = PathFinding.findPath(this.position, this.goal, mapGrid);\n    this.velocity = ORCA.computeAction(this.position, this.velocity, neighboringAgents); \n    this.position = updatePosition(this.position, this.velocity);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n\n**2. Collaborative Web Design with Multi-Agent Systems:**\n\nImagine a multi-agent system where LLMs collaboratively design website layouts. Each LLM (agent) is responsible for a specific component (navigation bar, content area, footer, etc.) and needs to arrange its component in a visually appealing and functional way.\n\n* **Components as Agents:**  Each component is an agent with properties like size, position, and style. The LLMs control these properties.\n* **Constraint Satisfaction with Local Communication:** Agents communicate constraints (e.g., \"I need at least 200px of horizontal space\") to their neighbors. This communication informs the `goalUpdate` procedure, enabling agents to adjust their goals (positions and sizes).  A constraint solver could further refine the layout.\n* **Visualization and Interaction:**  Use a JavaScript framework like React, Vue, or Svelte to render and manipulate the components visually, allowing the user to interact with the multi-agent design process.\n\n\n**3. Dynamic Content Delivery with Decentralized Agents:**\n\nConsider a news website distributing content across multiple servers (agents).  Decentralized agents can dynamically redirect traffic based on server load, network latency, and user location.\n\n* **Servers as Agents:**  Each server is an agent that monitors its load and network conditions.\n* **Load Balancing with Goal Exchanging:** Agents communicate their load levels.  The `goalUpdate` logic can be adapted to redistribute content (goals) to less loaded servers dynamically, optimizing content delivery.\n* **Implementation with Serverless Functions and APIs:**  Use serverless functions (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions) and APIs to implement the agents and their communication.  Client-side JavaScript can handle redirection based on server instructions.\n\n\n**Key Takeaways for JavaScript Developers:**\n\n* **Modularity:** The paper's decentralized approach encourages modular JavaScript code, where each agent encapsulates its logic and communicates with its neighbors.\n* **Real-time Applications:** This approach is well-suited for real-time web applications requiring dynamic agent coordination, like games, simulations, and collaborative tools.\n* **Scalability:** Decentralized systems can be more scalable than centralized ones, as each agent operates independently, reducing the load on a central coordinator.\n\n\nBy adapting the concepts from this paper, JavaScript developers can build sophisticated LLM-based multi-agent systems for a wide range of web applications, creating truly innovative and dynamic user experiences.  Remember that using LLMs for complex coordination can be challenging; careful design of agent communication and goal negotiation is crucial.  Experimenting with simpler scenarios first will be key to success.",
  "pseudocode": "The paper contains pseudocode blocks for two algorithms: `DEC-UNAV` and `goalUpdate`. Here are their JavaScript implementations with explanations:\n\n**1. DEC-UNAV (Decentralized Unlabeled Navigation)**\n\n```javascript\nasync function decUnav(agentId, workspace, position, goals, maxAction) {\n  let goal = selectGoal(goals, workspace, position);\n  let path = await constructPath(position, goal, workspace);\n\n  if (!path) {\n    return \"fail\"; // Pathfinding failed\n  }\n\n  let status = \"moveToGoal\";\n  let reachedGoals = {};\n  goals.forEach(g => reachedGoals[g] = false);\n\n  while (true) {\n    let neighbors = identifyLocalAvailableAgents();\n    let [positions, controls] = await receivePositionsControls(neighbors);\n    let goalAssignments = await receiveGoalAssignment(neighbors);\n    let agentStatuses = await receiveStatuses(neighbors);\n\n    let [newGoal, newStatus, newReachedGoals] = await goalUpdate(agentId, neighbors, goals, positions, goalAssignments, agentStatuses, reachedGoals);\n\n\n    if (!newGoal) return \"fail\";\n\n    reachedGoals = newReachedGoals;\n    status = newStatus;\n\n    if (goal !== newGoal || isDeviatingFromPath(position, path)) {\n      path = await constructPath(position, newGoal, workspace);\n      goal = newGoal;\n      if (!path) return \"fail\"\n    }\n\n\n    let action = computeAction(positions, controls, workspace, path, maxAction);\n    position = applyAction(position, action);\n  }\n}\n\n// Helper functions (placeholders; need actual implementation based on environment and navigation logic)\nfunction selectGoal(goals, workspace, position) { /* ... */ }\nasync function constructPath(start, goal, workspace) { /* ... */ }\nfunction identifyLocalAvailableAgents() { /* ... */ }\nasync function receivePositionsControls(neighbors) { /* ... */ }\nasync function receiveGoalAssignment(neighbors) { /* ... */ }\nasync function receiveStatuses(neighbors) { /* ... */ }\nfunction computeAction(positions, controls, workspace, path, maxAction) { /* ... */ }\nfunction applyAction(position, action) { /* ... */ }\nfunction isDeviatingFromPath(position, path){ /* ... */}\n```\n\n* **Purpose:** This algorithm guides a single agent in a multi-agent system to reach a goal location without collisions, in a decentralized and unlabeled manner.  \"Unlabeled\" signifies that agents are not pre-assigned to specific goals. \"Decentralized\" means each agent makes decisions based on local information and communication with nearby agents.\n* **Explanation:**  The agent selects a goal (initially the closest or randomly), plans a path, and moves towards it. Crucially, it communicates with neighbors, updates its goal if necessary (via `goalUpdate`), and replans the path if deviating significantly or its goal changes. Collision avoidance is handled by `computeAction`. The `async`/`await` syntax reflects the asynchronous nature of communication and potentially pathfinding in a real-world setting.\n\n\n**2. goalUpdate**\n\n```javascript\nasync function goalUpdate(agentId, neighbors, goals, positions, goalAssignments, agentStatuses, reachedGoals) {\n\n  for (let j of neighbors) {\n    if (agentStatuses[j] === \"moveToGoal\" && reachedGoals[goalAssignments[j]]) {\n      let newGoalForJ = findClosestUnreachedGoal(positions[j], goals, reachedGoals);\n\n      if (!newGoalForJ) return [null, null, null]; // failure\n\n      goalAssignments[j] = newGoalForJ;\n    }\n\n\n\n    if (agentStatuses[j] !== \"reached\" && isNear(positions[j], goalAssignments[j])) {\n      agentStatuses[j] = \"reached\";\n      reachedGoals[goalAssignments[j]] = true;\n\n        for (let k of neighbors) {\n\n            if (neighbors.indexOf(j) > neighbors.indexOf(k)) { // Check for prior k than j, and apply the following\n\n\n                if(goalAssignments[j] === goalAssignments[k]){ //if goals are same\n\n                        let alternateGoalForJ = findClosestUnreachedGoal(positions[j], goals, reachedGoals)\n                        if (!alternateGoalForJ) return [null, null, null]; // failure\n\n\n                    if(agentStatuses[j] !== \"reached\" && goalAssignments[j] !== alternateGoalForJ){\n\n                         goalAssignments[j] = alternateGoalForJ\n\n\n                    } else {\n\n                        let alternateGoalForK = findClosestUnreachedGoal(positions[k], goals.filter(g => g !== goalAssignments[j]) , reachedGoals)\n                        if (!alternateGoalForK) return [null, null, null]; // failure\n\n                        goalAssignments[k] = alternateGoalForK;\n\n                        agentStatuses[k] = \"moveToGoal\"\n\n\n                    }\n\n\n\n                } else if (agentStatuses[j] !== \"reached\" && agentStatuses[k] !== \"reached\" && !reachedGoals[goalAssignments[k]]) {\n\n                    if(swappable(positions[j], goalAssignments[j], positions[k], goalAssignments[k])){\n\n                        [goalAssignments[j], goalAssignments[k]] = [goalAssignments[k], goalAssignments[j]];\n\n                        goals = goals.filter(g => g !== goalAssignments[j]);\n\n\n                    }\n\n\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n    }\n\n\n\n  }\n  return [goalAssignments[agentId], agentStatuses[agentId], reachedGoals];\n\n}\n\n\nfunction isNear(position, goal) { /* ... */ }\nfunction findClosestUnreachedGoal(position, goals, reachedGoals) {/* ... */}\nfunction pathLen(start, goal){/*...*/}\nfunction swappable(positionJ, goalJ, positionK, goalK){/*...*/}\n```\n\n\n\n* **Purpose:** Manages goal assignments within a group of agents to ensure consistency and efficiency.\n* **Explanation:** This function iterates through neighboring agents. It reassigns a goal if it's already reached by another agent. It also resolves conflicts when two agents have the same goal, prioritizing the agent with the higher ID. The `swappable` criterion checks if swapping goals between two agents can improve overall path efficiency, leading to a swap if beneficial.\n\n\nThese JavaScript implementations reflect the logic presented in the pseudocode, ready for integration into a larger multi-agent system development project. You will still need to implement the helper functions according to your specific application's requirements. Remember that effective implementation also relies on appropriate choice of data structures and efficient handling of communication between agents.",
