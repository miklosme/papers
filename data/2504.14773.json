  "title": "PLANET: A Collection of Benchmarks for Evaluating LLMs' Planning Capabilities",
  "abstract": "Planning is central to agents and agentic AI. The ability to plan, e.g., creating travel itineraries within a budget, holds immense potential in both scientific and commercial contexts. Moreover, optimal plans tend to require fewer resources compared to ad-hoc methods. To date, a comprehensive understanding of existing planning benchmarks appears to be lacking. Without it, comparing planning algorithms' performance across domains or selecting suitable algorithms for new scenarios remains challenging. In this paper, we examine a range of planning benchmarks to identify commonly used testbeds for algorithm development and highlight potential gaps. These benchmarks are categorized into embodied environments, web navigation, scheduling, games and puzzles, and everyday task automation. Our study recommends the most appropriate benchmarks for various algorithms and offers insights to guide future benchmark development.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces PLANET, a comprehensive survey of benchmarks for evaluating the planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in the context of agentic AI.  It categorizes existing benchmarks based on application domains like embodied environments, web navigation, scheduling, games, and task automation.\n\nKey takeaways for LLM-based multi-agent systems include:\n\n* **Emphasis on planning:** The paper highlights the crucial role of planning in LLM agents for complex task completion.\n* **Benchmark categorization:** Provides a structured overview of various planning benchmarks, facilitating selection for specific multi-agent scenarios.\n* **Multi-agent environments:** Benchmarks like GAMA-Bench and AgentBoard specifically test LLM decision-making in competitive and collaborative multi-agent settings.\n* **Gaps in current benchmarks:** Identifies areas needing improvement, such as the complexity of world models, long-horizon tasks, planning under uncertainty, and multimodal planning support. This is particularly relevant for building robust multi-agent systems.\n* **Relevance of games:** Games are emphasized as valuable testbeds for strategic planning and multi-agent behavior in LLMs.\n* **Shift towards embodied and web-based agents:** The survey demonstrates a growing trend towards testing LLMs in interactive environments like simulated households (ALFWorld, VirtualHome) and websites (WebArena, Mind2Web), pushing beyond text-based reasoning. This trend is directly applicable to building real-world multi-agent applications.",
  "takeaways": "This paper provides a comprehensive overview of planning benchmarks for LLM agents, which is extremely valuable for JavaScript developers venturing into multi-agent web applications. Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights:\n\n**1. Understanding the Benchmarks:**\n\n* **Embodied Environments (VirtualHome, ALFRED):**  While primarily for robotics, these inspire JavaScript developers to think about modeling user interfaces as \"embodied\" spaces.  A user navigating a complex web app (e.g., e-commerce, project management) can be seen as an agent in an environment.  This informs the design of agent actions (clicks, form submissions) and state representation (DOM elements, application state).  Frameworks like React or Vue.js, with their component-based structure, lend themselves well to representing UI elements as parts of an environment.\n* **Web Navigation (WebArena, Mind2Web):**  Directly relevant to web development.  Use these benchmarks as inspiration for creating test scenarios for your multi-agent web app.  Puppeteer or Playwright can simulate agent interactions (clicks, form fills) with the webpage, while the LLM agent makes decisions based on the webpage's content (extracted using libraries like Cheerio).\n* **Scheduling (TravelPlanner):**  Imagine building a multi-agent meeting scheduler within a web app.  TravelPlanner's focus on constraints (time, location, resources) is crucial.  JavaScript developers can represent these constraints using objects and implement planning algorithms (potentially LLM-assisted) that satisfy them, visualizing the schedule with libraries like FullCalendar.\n* **Games and Puzzles (AucArena, GAMA-Bench):**  The strategic planning aspect of these benchmarks is highly transferable.  Imagine a multi-agent game in a browser, or a collaborative planning tool.  Game theory concepts become relevant.  Libraries like TensorFlow.js can be used for implementing reinforcement learning algorithms for agent training, if the LLM doesn't handle agent policy generation directly.\n\n**2. Building Multi-Agent Web Apps:**\n\n* **Agent Architecture:**  LangChain.js is an ideal framework for building LLM-powered agents.  Define agent tools (e.g., web scraping, database access, API interaction) using JavaScript and have the LLM agents use these tools to execute their plans.  Each agent can have its own toolset, fostering specialization.\n* **Communication & Coordination:**  Consider implementing a message-passing system (e.g., using WebSockets or a serverless function backend) for agent communication and coordination. The benchmarks' focus on multi-agent interactions (e.g., GAMA-Bench) emphasizes the need for communication protocols.\n* **State Representation:** Define a clear state representation for your web application.  This could be a JavaScript object containing relevant information (e.g., user profiles, product listings, game board state). This will be the input to the LLM agents for decision-making, mimicking the state representation in the benchmarks.\n* **Evaluation:** Use metrics inspired by the benchmarks to evaluate your multi-agent system.  For web navigation tasks, success rate (like in WebArena) is important.  For scheduling, constraint satisfaction and efficiency (like in TravelPlanner) matter.  Implement logging and analytics within your JavaScript code to track these metrics.\n\n**3. Example Scenario (Collaborative Project Management Tool):**\n\nImagine a multi-agent system where one agent manages tasks, another handles communication, and a third tracks resources.  Each agent would be a LangChain.js agent with specialized tools.\n\n* **Task Agent:** Uses tools to access a task database, update task status, and assign tasks to team members (using API calls written in JavaScript).\n* **Communication Agent:**  Uses tools to send emails, post updates to a project chat, and summarize progress reports.\n* **Resource Agent:** Tracks budget, time allocation, and resource availability, and alerts other agents to potential conflicts.\n\nThe state representation would be a JavaScript object containing the project's tasks, resources, and team member information.\n\nBy using the benchmarks as a guide, and leveraging the power of LLMs through frameworks like LangChain.js, JavaScript developers can create innovative multi-agent web applications that exhibit enhanced automation, personalized experiences, and efficient task management. The paper encourages you to not just *use* LLMs but to *evaluate* them critically and design appropriate testing scenarios.  This will help you unlock the full potential of multi-agent systems in the web development space.",
