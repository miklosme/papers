  "title": "INCREASING THE VALUE OF INFORMATION DURING PLANNING IN\nUNCERTAIN ENVIRONMENTS",
  "abstract": "ABSTRACT. Prior studies have demonstrated that for many real-world problems, POMDPS can be solved through online algorithms both quickly and with near optimality [10, 8, 6]. However, on an important set of problems where there is a large time delay between when the agent can gather information and when it needs to use that information, these solutions fail to adequately consider the value of information. As a result, information gathering actions, even when they are critical in the optimal policy, will be ignored by existing solutions, leading to sub-optimal decisions by the agent. In this research, we develop a novel solution that rectifies this problem by introducing a new algorithm that improves upon state-of-the-art online planning by better reflecting on the value of actions that gather information. We do this by adding Entropy to the UCB1 heuristic in the POMCP algorithm. We test this solution on the hallway problem. Results indicate that our new algorithm performs significantly better than POMCP.",
  "summary": "This research tackles the challenge of making online planning algorithms, specifically POMCP, more effective in situations where gathering information is crucial but delayed rewards make it difficult for the algorithm to recognize its value. \n\nA key insight relevant to LLM-based multi-agent systems is the proposed solution: incorporating \"entropy\" into the decision-making process. By favoring actions that reduce uncertainty (i.e., lower entropy), even if they don't yield immediate rewards, the algorithm becomes better at recognizing the long-term value of information gathering. This is particularly relevant for LLM-based agents which often operate in information-rich environments where strategically acquiring information is key.",
  "takeaways": "This research paper delves into a critical limitation of the POMCP algorithm (a core algorithm for decision-making in uncertain environments), particularly for LLM-based multi-agent web applications.  Hereâ€™s how JavaScript developers can apply its insights:\n\n**The Problem: Delayed Rewards in Web Apps**\n\nImagine building a multi-agent system for a collaborative code editor like CodePen, where each agent is an LLM instance assisting a developer.  An agent might need to:\n\n1. **Gather Information:**  Analyze the codebase, understand the developer's intent (e.g., through comments or past edits). This is analogous to 'listening for the tiger' in the paper.\n2. **Delay Action:**  Wait for an opportune moment to suggest a code completion or refactor, potentially many user actions later. This delay is where POMCP falters.\n\n**The Paper's Solution: Prioritizing Information with Entropy**\n\nThe paper introduces POMCPe, a modified algorithm that values information gathering even when rewards are delayed.  Here's how you might apply it:\n\n**1. Agent Implementation (Langchain.js)**\n\n```javascript\nimport { AgentExecutor, ZeroShotAgent } from 'langchain/agents';\nimport { OpenAI } from 'langchain/llms';\n\nconst llm = new OpenAI(); // Assuming you have OpenAI API setup\n\n// Define agent's tools/actions (e.g., analyze code, suggest edit)\nconst tools = [/*... your custom tools*/];\n\n// Create a custom agent class incorporating entropy in decision-making\nclass EntropyAwareAgent extends ZeroShotAgent {\n  // ... (Implement logic to select actions based on POMCPe's entropy heuristic) \n}\n\nconst agent = new EntropyAwareAgent({ \n  llm, \n  tools,\n  // ... other agent configuration\n});\n\nconst executor = new AgentExecutor({ agent, tools });\n\n// ... Use the 'executor' to interact with your web app's environment\n```\n\n**2. Practical Application (Socket.IO)**\n\n* **Real-time Collaboration:** Use Socket.IO to create a persistent connection between the web app and your LLM agents.\n* **Event-Driven Architecture:**  Trigger agent actions based on user events (code changes, comments, etc.). This allows agents to gather information continuously.\n* **Entropy-Based Prioritization:** Modify your agent's decision-making logic (see Langchain.js example) to prioritize actions that reduce uncertainty about the developer's goals or the project's structure.\n\n**JavaScript Libraries & Frameworks**\n\n* **Langchain.js:** For building the core agent logic and tool integrations.\n* **TensorFlow.js:** To potentially implement more sophisticated entropy calculations or belief state representations.\n* **Socket.IO:** For real-time communication between your web app frontend and backend LLM agents.\n\n**Impact on Web Development**\n\n* **Smarter Assistants:**  Imagine LLM-powered agents that proactively provide insights during a coding session, anticipating your needs based on subtle cues.\n* **Enhanced Collaboration:**  Multi-agent systems where LLMs act as mediators, resolving conflicts, suggesting solutions, and optimizing workflows in collaborative web apps (e.g., design tools, project management platforms).\n\n**Experimentation**\n\n1. **Simplified Scenario:** Start with a simplified version of your web app (e.g., a single-page code editor).\n2. **Simulated Users:**  Generate synthetic user actions to test your agents' behavior under various uncertainty levels.\n3. **Metric Tracking:**  Measure how often agents choose information-gathering actions and how this impacts overall performance. \n\nThis paper offers a practical way to address a common challenge in LLM-based multi-agent systems. By incorporating entropy into agent decision-making, you can build web applications with a new level of intelligence and responsiveness.",

It is responsible for planning a sequence of actions for the agent to take in the environment. \n * **Explanation:** The function starts by checking if the belief node has any particles. If it does not, then it samples a state from the initial belief. Otherwise, it samples a state from the particle filter. The function then calls the `simulate` function to simulate the environment starting from the sampled state. The process is repeated until the planning time runs out.\n\n**Algorithm 2: `simulate(state, beliefNode, depth)`**\n * **Purpose:** This function simulates the environment for a given state, belief node, and depth. \n * **Explanation:** The function first checks if the maximum planning depth has been reached. If it has, then it returns 0. Otherwise, it checks if the belief node is a leaf node and if the environment has not terminated. If both of these conditions are true, then the function expands the belief node by adding action nodes for all possible actions. The function then performs a rollout simulation from the current state and returns the reward. If the belief node is not a leaf node or if the environment has terminated, then the function chooses the best action to take based on the UCB1 heuristic and the entropy heuristic. The function then executes the chosen action in the environment and gets the child belief node corresponding to the observation. If the child belief node doesn't exist, then the function creates it. The function then adds the current state to the particle filter of the child belief node and updates the entropy of the child belief node. Finally, the function updates the visit counts and values of the belief nodes and action nodes and returns the reward.\n\n**Algorithm 3: `rollout(state, beliefNode, depth)`**\n * **Purpose:**  This function performs a rollout simulation from a given state, belief node, and depth. \n * **Explanation:** The function first checks if the maximum planning depth has been reached. If it has, then it returns 0. Otherwise, it chooses a random action and executes the chosen action in the environment. The function then gets the child belief node corresponding to the observation. If the child belief node doesn't exist, then the function creates it. Finally, the function returns the reward plus the discounted reward from the rollout simulation.",
