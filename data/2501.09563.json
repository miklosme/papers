  "title": "A multi-agent system for hybrid optimization",
  "abstract": "Optimization problems in process engineering, including design and operation, can often pose challenges to many solvers: multi-modal, non-smooth, and discontinuous models often with large computational requirements. In such cases, the optimization problem is often treated as a black box in which only the value of the objective function is required, sometimes with some indication of the measure of the violation of the constraints. Such problems have traditionally been tackled through the use of direct search and meta-heuristic methods. The challenge, then, is to determine which of these methods or combination of methods should be considered to make most effective use of finite computational resources. This paper presents a multi-agent system for optimization which enables a set of solvers to be applied simultaneously to an optimization problem, including different instantiations of any solver. The evaluation of the optimization problem model is controlled by a scheduler agent which facilitates cooperation and competition between optimization methods. The architecture and implementation of the agent system is described in detail, including the solver, model evaluation, and scheduler agents. A suite of direct search and meta-heuristic methods has been developed for use with this system. Case studies from process systems engineering applications are presented and the results show the potential benefits of automated cooperation between different optimization solvers and motivates the implementation of competition between solvers.",
  "summary": "This paper presents a multi-agent system for optimizing complex engineering problems, particularly those involving \"black box\" scenarios where internal workings are opaque.  It uses multiple optimization algorithms (solvers) concurrently, coordinated by a scheduler agent, and evaluates solutions using separate model evaluation agents. An analysis agent tracks the best solutions found and shares them with the solvers, enabling cooperation.\n\nKey points for LLM-based multi-agent systems:\n\n* **Black Box Optimization:** The system's design is relevant to LLMs, which can also be considered black boxes due to their complex inner workings. The agent-based architecture can be adapted for optimizing LLM prompts and parameters.\n\n* **Agent Collaboration:**  The scheduler and analysis agents facilitate collaboration among solvers (optimization algorithms). This structure can be used in LLM-based systems where multiple agents, each utilizing different prompting strategies or LLMs, collaborate to achieve a goal.\n\n* **Decoupled Evaluation:** Separating the model evaluation from the solvers allows for flexible and potentially parallel evaluation, suitable for situations where interacting with an LLM is computationally expensive.\n\n* **Dynamic Optimization:** The system adapts its search based on ongoing results. This is relevant for dynamic LLM tasks where the optimal strategy might change based on user interactions or other evolving factors.\n\n* **Multi-Objective Optimization:** The system's support for multiple objectives is applicable to optimizing LLMs for multiple criteria (e.g., accuracy, fluency, safety).",
  "takeaways": "This research paper presents a valuable concept for JavaScript developers working with LLM-based multi-agent systems: allowing diverse AI agents (using different LLMs or prompting strategies) to cooperate and even compete to solve complex tasks. Hereâ€™s how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights:\n\n**1. Decoupled Model Evaluation:**\n\n* **Concept:** The paper emphasizes separating model evaluation (LLM interaction) from the individual solver agents. This creates a central point of control and efficiency.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** Create a dedicated `ModelEvaluator` class. This class handles all interactions with the LLM (e.g., OpenAI API, LangChain). Solver agents send requests to this class, which returns the LLM's response.  This avoids redundant calls and facilitates resource management.\n\n```javascript\nclass ModelEvaluator {\n  constructor(llm) {\n    this.llm = llm;\n  }\n\n  evaluate(agentId, prompt) {\n    return this.llm.call(prompt).then(response => ({ agentId, response })); \n  }\n}\n```\n\n**2. Scheduler Agent:**\n\n* **Concept:** The scheduler acts as a central coordinator, assigning tasks to solver agents and managing communication. It can implement priority queues as suggested in the paper.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** A scheduler can be implemented using Node.js with libraries like `async` or Promises to manage concurrent operations. It uses a priority queue data structure (easily implemented with a library or custom code) to manage agent requests.\n\n```javascript\nclass Scheduler {\n  constructor(modelEvaluator, agents) { /* ... */ }\n\n  addTask(agentId, task) { /* Add task to priority queue */ }\n\n  run() { \n    /* Continuously pick highest priority task, send to ModelEvaluator,\n       handle response, and update agents */\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**3. Diverse Solver Agents:**\n\n* **Concept:** The power of this approach is using diverse agents with different strategies (different LLMs, prompts, or even traditional algorithms).\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** Create separate classes for different agents.  Each agent implements its own logic for prompt construction or problem-solving.\n\n```javascript\nclass AgentA { // Uses GPT-3.5\n  constructor(scheduler, modelEvaluator) { /* ... */ }\n  solve(task) { /* Construct prompt for GPT-3.5 */ }\n}\n\nclass AgentB { // Uses a custom heuristic\n  solve(task) { /* Apply heuristic to the task */ }\n}\n```\n\n**4. Analysis Agent:**\n\n* **Concept:** This agent monitors results, tracks the best solutions, and informs the scheduler.  It's essential for multi-objective optimization.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** A simple class that receives results from the `ModelEvaluator`, compares them using defined metrics (e.g., for multi-objective optimization as described in the paper), and updates the scheduler about improvements.\n\n**5. Web Application Scenarios:**\n\n* **Content Creation:** Different agents specialize in generating different types of content (e.g., headlines, body text, images).  The scheduler orchestrates their work to produce a complete article or website section.\n* **Chatbots:** Agents with different personalities or expertise can collaboratively handle complex user queries.  The scheduler selects the most suitable agent or combines their responses.\n* **E-commerce:** Agents could handle pricing optimization, product recommendations, and customer service, cooperating to maximize sales and customer satisfaction.\n\n**6. JavaScript Frameworks:**\n\n* **Node.js:** Essential for building the backend of a multi-agent system, providing asynchronous programming and the ability to easily communicate with LLMs via API calls.\n* **LangChain:** Simplifies LLM interaction, chain creation, and prompt management.\n* **WebSockets:** Enable real-time communication between the backend (agents, scheduler) and a frontend UI to display progress or allow user interaction.\n* **React/Vue/Angular:** For building interactive frontend interfaces for multi-agent applications.\n\n\n**Example - Collaborative Content Creation:**\n\nImagine building a web application for generating marketing copy.  You could have one agent specialize in catchy headlines (using GPT-3.5 with specific prompts), another in informative body text (using a different LLM or a fine-tuned model), and a third in image generation using DALL-E.  The JavaScript scheduler would coordinate their tasks, ensuring a coherent and effective final output.\n\nBy implementing these concepts in JavaScript, developers can leverage the power of multi-agent AI systems to create more sophisticated and intelligent web applications. The ability to combine and control diverse AI agents opens exciting new possibilities for web development.",
  "pseudocode": "The provided research paper contains a flowchart (Figure 2) describing the scheduler agent's logic, which can be interpreted as a pseudocode representation. Here's the JavaScript equivalent:\n\n```javascript\nclass SchedulerAgent {\n  constructor() {\n    this.schedulingQueue = []; // Priority queue for evaluation requests\n    this.availableModels = [];  // Queue of available model evaluators\n  }\n\n  async receiveMessage(message) {\n    if (message.type === 'NEW_BEST_SOLUTION') {\n      // Broadcast the new best solution to all solvers\n      for (const solver of solvers) { // Assuming 'solvers' is an array of solver agents\n        solver.send(message);\n      }\n    } else if (message.type === 'MODEL_AVAILABLE') {\n      this.availableModels.push(message.sender);\n    } else if (message.type === 'EVALUATE_POINT') {\n      this.schedulingQueue.push(message); // Add evaluation request to queue\n    }\n\n    // Process queues if both are not empty\n    while (this.schedulingQueue.length > 0 && this.availableModels.length > 0) {\n      const request = this.schedulingQueue.shift(); // Get highest priority request\n      const model = this.availableModels.shift();\n\n      // Send point to model for evaluation\n      const evaluationResult = await model.evaluate(request.point);\n\n      // Send evaluation result back to the requesting solver\n      request.sender.send({ type: 'EVALUATION_RESULT', result: evaluationResult });\n\n      // Send result to analysis agent as well (not explicitly shown in flowchart)\n      analysisAgent.send({ type: 'EVALUATION_RESULT', result: evaluationResult });\n\n      this.updateQueues(); // Update priority levels in the scheduling queue\n    }\n  }\n\n  updateQueues() {\n    // Implement logic to promote requests in the scheduling queue based on priority\n    // This is similar to multi-tasking scheduling, as described in the paper\n    // ... (Implementation details will depend on the specific priority scheme used)\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n// Example usage (simplified):\nconst scheduler = new SchedulerAgent();\nconst analysisAgent = new AnalysisAgent(); // Assuming AnalysisAgent is defined elsewhere\n\n// Register solvers with the scheduler (not explicitly shown in the flowchart but necessary)\n// ...\n\n// Example of a solver requesting an evaluation:\nconst solver = /* ... */;\nconst point = /* ... */;\n\nscheduler.receiveMessage({ \n  type: 'EVALUATE_POINT', \n  point: point, \n  sender: solver //  pass the solver instance\n});\n\n\n// Example of a model becoming available:\nconst model = /* ... */;\nscheduler.receiveMessage({ type: 'MODEL_AVAILABLE', sender: model });\n\n// Example of a new best solution being found:\nconst bestSolution = /* ... */;\nscheduler.receiveMessage({ type: 'NEW_BEST_SOLUTION', solution: bestSolution });\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Explanation and Purpose:**\n\nThe Scheduler Agent is the core of the multi-agent system.  Its primary responsibility is to manage the evaluation of points in the search space, efficiently distributing the workload among available model evaluation agents. It uses two queues: `schedulingQueue` for incoming evaluation requests from solver agents and `availableModels` for ready-to-work model evaluators.  It prioritizes requests and dispatches them to models as they become available.  It also broadcasts new best solutions, received from the analysis agent, back to the solvers to enable cooperation. The `updateQueues` function, which manages the request promotion logic, isn't fully specified in the paper, but it uses a priority-based scheme, similar to operating system task schedulers. This code converts the flowchart's logic into a working JavaScript structure, incorporating message passing, queuing, and task distribution.  The async/await mechanism handles the asynchronous nature of model evaluations.  This implementation makes it easier for JavaScript developers to build and experiment with multi-agent optimization systems.",
