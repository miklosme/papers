  "title": "Towards Computer-Using Personal Agents",
  "abstract": "Computer-Using Agents (CUA) enable users to automate increasingly-complex tasks using graphical interfaces such as browsers. As many potential tasks require personal data, we propose Computer-Using Personal Agents (CUPAs) that have access to an external repository of the user's personal data. Compared with CUAs, CUPAs offer users better control of their personal data, the potential to automate more tasks involving personal data, better interoperability with external sources of data, and better capabilities to coordinate with other CUPAs in order to solve collaborative tasks involving the personal data of multiple users.",
  "summary": "This paper proposes Computer-Using Personal Agents (CUPAs), which are AI agents (like existing CUAs, such as OpenAI's Operator) with secure access to a user's personal data, envisioned as a Personal Knowledge Graph (PKG).  This allows CUPAs to perform complex, personalized tasks involving sensitive information while giving users greater control and oversight.\n\nKey points for LLM-based multi-agent systems:\n\n* **LLMs as the core of CUPAs:** LLMs would drive the interaction with graphical user interfaces, websites, and APIs, enabling complex task automation.\n* **PKG for data management:**  The PKG acts as a structured, private data store managed by the user, addressing privacy and control concerns.\n* **Multi-agent negotiation:** CUPAs could negotiate with other CUPAs on behalf of their users, leveraging personal data for mutually beneficial outcomes.\n* **AI alignment and user-in-the-loop:**  CUPAs must prioritize user intentions and values, remaining accountable and explainable.  User oversight is crucial for sensitive actions.\n* **Interoperability and communication:** CUPAs need standardized communication protocols and data formats to interact with each other and diverse web services.\n* **Security and privacy:** Robust security measures are essential for protecting sensitive data within the PKG and during agent interactions.",
  "takeaways": "This paper introduces the concept of Computer-Using Personal Agents (CUPAs), which are essentially AI agents with access to a user's personal data, stored in a Personal Knowledge Graph (PKG).  Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights:\n\n**1. Building a PKG:**\n\n* **Data Storage:**  Use JavaScript libraries like `jsonld.js` or `rdflib.js` to represent the PKG data in formats like JSON-LD or RDF.  These formats are well-suited for semantic web technologies and allow for richer data representation and reasoning. Consider decentralized storage solutions like Solid pods or IPFS for enhanced user control over their data.\n* **Access Control:**  Implement access control policies using ODRL or similar languages.  Libraries like `node-odrl` can help with policy parsing and enforcement. This ensures the CUA only accesses the data the user permits.\n* **PKG Population:**  Create JavaScript functions to populate the PKG from various sources:\n    * **Browser Extensions:** Develop extensions that capture user interactions with web forms and add that data to the PKG.\n    * **APIs:**  Integrate with APIs from social media, calendars, or other services to import user data with appropriate consent.\n    * **User Input:** Provide user interfaces for manual data entry and updates to the PKG.\n\n**2. Developing the CUA:**\n\n* **LLM Integration:** Use JavaScript libraries like `langchain.js` to integrate with Large Language Models (LLMs) for tasks like natural language understanding, text generation, and reasoning.\n* **Agent Framework:** Leverage agent frameworks like `agents.js` or develop custom agent logic to manage the CUA's behavior. Define goals, actions, and decision-making processes based on the user's needs and the PKG data.\n* **Web Interactions:** Use browser automation libraries like `Puppeteer` or `Playwright` to enable the CUA to interact with websites, fill out forms, and perform other tasks on the user's behalf.  Alternatively, explore using `node-fetch` or `axios` for direct interaction with website APIs as suggested in the paper for \"Web-aware CUPAs\".\n* **Negotiation & Coordination:** For multi-agent scenarios, implement communication protocols and negotiation strategies using libraries like `socket.io` or message queues. This allows CUPAs to collaborate and share information.\n\n**3. Practical Web Development Examples:**\n\n* **E-commerce:** A CUA could help users find products based on their preferences (stored in the PKG), compare prices across different websites, and automatically apply coupons or discounts.\n* **Travel Planning:** A CUA could book flights and hotels based on the user's travel history, preferences, and budget, negotiating with other agents (e.g., airline booking systems) to find the best deals.\n* **Personal Assistants:** A CUA could manage the user's calendar, set reminders, and provide personalized recommendations based on their interests and daily routines.\n* **Healthcare:**  A CUA could help users manage their health records, schedule appointments, and track medication adherence, taking into account allergies and other medical information from the PKG.\n\n**4. Addressing Challenges:**\n\n* **Explainability & Traceability:** Log CUA actions and decisions, including the data used from the PKG and the reasoning behind the actions. This creates an audit trail and improves transparency.\n* **Security & Privacy:** Implement robust security measures to protect the PKG data, including encryption and access control. Adhere to relevant privacy regulations like GDPR.\n* **User-in-the-Loop:** Design clear user interfaces that allow users to control the CUA, provide feedback, and adjust settings. Balance autonomy with user oversight.\n\n**Example JavaScript Snippet (PKG Data Representation using JSON-LD):**\n\n```javascript\nconst pkg = {\n  \"@context\": {\n    \"name\": \"http://schema.org/name\",\n    \"address\": \"http://schema.org/address\"\n  },\n  \"@id\": \"user:sam\",\n  \"name\": \"Sam\",\n  \"address\": {\n    \"@id\": \"address:home\",\n    \"streetAddress\": \"123 Main St\"\n  }\n};\n```\n\nBy combining these techniques, JavaScript developers can build practical and powerful CUPAs that enhance user experiences and automate complex web-based tasks while respecting privacy and ensuring user control. The paper's roadmap provides a structured approach to progressively enhance CUPA capabilities, starting with PKG integration and moving toward web-aware and multi-agent systems.",
