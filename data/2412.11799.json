  "title": "Adaptive Manipulation for Coalitions in Knockout Tournaments",
  "abstract": "Knockout tournaments, also known as single-elimination or cup tournaments, are a popular form of sports competitions. In the standard probabilistic setting, for each pairing of players, one of the players wins the game with a certain (a priori known) probability. Due to their competitive nature, tournaments are prone to manipulation. We investigate the computational problem of determining whether, for a given tournament, a coalition has a manipulation strategy that increases the winning probability of a designated player above a given threshold. More precisely, in every round of the tournament, coalition players can strategically decide which games to throw based on the advancement of other players to the current round. We call this setting adaptive constructive coalition manipulation. To the best of our knowledge, while coalition manipulation has been studied in the literature, this is the first work to introduce adaptiveness to this context. We show that the above problem is hard for every complexity class in the polynomial hierarchy. On the algorithmic side, we show that the problem is solvable in polynomial time when the coalition size is a constant. Furthermore, we show that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the coalition size and the size of a minimum player set that must include at least one player from each non-deterministic game. Lastly, we investigate a generalized setting where the tournament tree can be imbalanced.",
  "summary": "This paper explores how a group of cooperating players (a coalition) can manipulate a knockout tournament to make their chosen player win. It introduces the concept of *adaptive* manipulation, where coalition members decide which matches to intentionally lose based on who advances in each round, using the most up-to-date information.\n\nKey points relevant to LLM-based multi-agent systems:\n\n* **Adaptive strategies:** The paper highlights the importance of adaptive strategies in multi-agent systems, where agents adjust their behavior based on real-time observations. This relates to how LLMs in multi-agent scenarios could adjust responses based on evolving interactions.\n* **Complexity of coordination:**  The paper demonstrates the computational complexity of coordinating actions even in a simplified tournament setting. This highlights the challenges of designing efficient coordination mechanisms for LLM-based multi-agent systems.\n* **Game theory:** The manipulation strategies considered are essentially game-theoretic in nature, involving players optimizing their actions to achieve a desired outcome. This emphasizes the relevance of game theory concepts in designing and analyzing LLM-based multi-agent interactions.\n* **Best-response calculation:**  The \"best-response\" problem introduced, where agents calculate the optimal action for the current round, connects to how LLMs could be used to determine the best next response in multi-agent conversations or tasks.",
  "takeaways": "This paper explores the computational complexity of manipulating knockout tournaments with coalitions of cooperating agents, introducing the concept of *adaptive* strategies. While the paper focuses on theoretical complexity, its insights about adaptive manipulation, coalition behavior, and the challenges of predicting outcomes in probabilistic environments are valuable for JavaScript developers building LLM-based multi-agent web apps.\n\nHere are some practical examples illustrating how JavaScript developers can apply these insights:\n\n**1. Adaptive Strategies in Multi-Agent Games:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine building a web-based strategy game where multiple LLM-powered agents compete for resources. Each agent controls a faction, and players can form alliances (coalitions).\n* **Application of Insights:** Instead of pre-programming fixed strategies, developers can design agents that adapt their tactics based on the current game state and the actions of other agents.  The paper highlights the power of such adaptive manipulations.  In JavaScript, this could involve using a game state tree or a similar data structure to track game progression and trigger different LLM prompts based on the branching path.  Libraries like `chess.js` (for chess-like logic) or custom state management solutions with React, Vue, or Angular could be employed.\n\n```javascript\n// Example: Adaptive resource gathering based on opponent actions\nif (opponentFaction.resourceLevel > threshold) {\n  // Prompt the LLM to prioritize attacking opponent's resource sources\n  const llmPrompt = `Prioritize disrupting ${opponentFaction.name}'s resource acquisition. Current resources: ${myFaction.resourceLevel}.`;\n  const llmResponse = await queryLLM(llmPrompt);\n  // ...Process LLM response and adjust agent actions...\n}\n```\n\n\n**2. Coalition Formation and Management:**\n\n* **Scenario:** A collaborative web application where LLM agents assist users with complex tasks, such as project planning or content creation. Agents can form coalitions to address larger projects.\n* **Application of Insights:** The paper's analysis of coalition manipulation emphasizes the importance of carefully considering coalition members' capabilities and potential conflicts.  In a JavaScript application, you might represent coalitions as objects with properties for member agents, shared goals, and communication channels.  Using Socket.IO or similar libraries, real-time negotiation and task allocation amongst coalition members can be implemented.\n\n```javascript\n// Example: Coalition formation based on agent skills\nconst coalition = {\n  members: [agentA, agentB],\n  goal: \"Write a marketing proposal\",\n  communicationChannel: socket, // Using Socket.IO\n};\n\nsocket.on(\"taskAssigned\", (agent, task) => {\n  // Update coalition's internal task allocation\n});\n\n```\n\n\n**3. Probabilistic Modeling of LLM Behavior:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Building a customer service chatbot that uses multiple specialized LLM agents, each handling a different aspect of customer interaction (e.g., order processing, technical support).\n* **Application of Insights:** Recognizing that LLM outputs are probabilistic (not deterministic), developers can design systems that account for uncertainty.  The paper's focus on probabilistic tournament outcomes translates to predicting the success of LLM-driven conversations.  JavaScript developers could use probabilistic data structures or Bayesian networks to model the likelihood of different conversation paths and optimize the agent selection process.  Libraries like `bayes.js` could be helpful.\n\n\n**4.  Simulating LLM-based Agent Interactions:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  Before deploying a complex multi-agent system, it's crucial to test its behavior under various conditions.\n* **Application of Insights:** The knockout tournament structure provides a framework for creating simulations. Developers can simulate interactions between LLM-powered agents using a tournament-style setup, observing how coalitions form and how adaptive strategies perform in a controlled environment.  This can be done in Node.js, using a library like `tournament` to manage the tournament structure.  The simulations can inform parameter tuning and strategy refinement for the LLMs.\n\n\n\nBy incorporating these insights, JavaScript developers can create more robust, adaptive, and effective LLM-based multi-agent applications for the web.  The key takeaways are to embrace adaptability, manage coalitions thoughtfully, and design systems that handle the inherent uncertainty of LLM outputs.",
