  "title": "ConvoyLLM: Dynamic Multi-Lane Convoy Control Using LLMs",
  "abstract": "Abstract-This paper proposes a novel method for multi-lane convoy formation control that uses large language models (LLMs) to tackle coordination challenges in dynamic highway environments. Each connected and autonomous vehicle in the convoy uses a knowledge-driven approach to make real-time adaptive decisions based on various scenarios. Our method enables vehicles to dynamically perform tasks, including obstacle avoidance, convoy joining/leaving, and escort formation switching, all while maintaining the overall convoy structure. We design a Interlaced formation control strategy based on locally dynamic distributed graphs, ensuring the convoy remains stable and flexible. We conduct extensive experiments in the SUMO simulation platform across multiple traffic scenarios, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective, robust, and adaptable to dynamic environments. The code is available at: https://github.com/chuduanfeng/ConvoyLLM.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces ConvoyLLM, a system using Large Language Models (LLMs) to control multi-lane vehicle convoys on highways.  Each vehicle uses its own LLM to make real-time driving decisions (lane changes, speed adjustments) based on its perception of the environment and the state of other vehicles in the convoy. A shared memory and interlaced formation control strategy promote cooperation and flexibility within the convoy.  The system aims to improve traffic flow, safety, and fuel efficiency by intelligently coordinating autonomous vehicles in dynamic multi-lane scenarios.  Key LLM aspects include per-vehicle decision-making using LLMs, few-shot prompting, a shared memory for collaborative learning, and an action decoder to translate LLM outputs into control commands.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents exciting opportunities for JavaScript developers working with LLM-based multi-agent systems, particularly in web-based simulations and collaborative applications. Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply the insights from the ConvoyLLM paper:\n\n**1. Client-Side Agent Reasoning with LLMs:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine building a collaborative online strategy game where multiple user-controlled units (agents) interact.  Each unit could have a client-side LLM (like a smaller version of LLaMA) integrated using a JavaScript library like `transformers.js` (hypothetical, research is ongoing to make this practical for browser environments).\n* **ConvoyLLM application:** Mimic the reasoning module by feeding the LLM contextual information (game state, unit stats, nearby enemy units) formatted as prompts, similar to the paper's approach.  The LLM then outputs high-level actions (attack, defend, move).\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    ```javascript\n    // Hypothetical example using a transformers.js library\n    const llm = new transformers.js.LLM('llama-mini'); // Load a lightweight LLM\n\n    function getAgentAction(gameState, unitStats, nearbyEnemies) {\n      const prompt = `Current state: ${gameState}\\nUnit stats: ${unitStats}\\nNearby enemies: ${nearbyEnemies}\\nAction:`;\n      const action = await llm.generate(prompt);\n      return action;\n    }\n    ```\n* **Framework Integration:** Integrate this with a game framework like Phaser or Babylon.js to handle rendering and game logic.\n\n**2. Shared Memory with Serverless Functions:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  In a collaborative design tool where multiple users (agents) are editing a 3D model or document simultaneously.\n* **ConvoyLLM application:**  Replicate the shared memory concept using a serverless function (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions) written in Node.js.  This function stores the history of agent actions and design changes.  LLMs on the client-side can query this shared memory for context when making decisions (e.g., suggest design changes based on previous user interactions).\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** Client-side JavaScript would use fetch or Axios to send API requests to the serverless function to retrieve shared memories.\n\n**3. Local Dynamic Distributed Graph with WebSockets:**\n\n* **Scenario:** A real-time traffic simulation in the browser.\n* **ConvoyLLM application:**  The interlaced formation control strategy can be implemented using a library like `vis.js` or `sigma.js` to visualize the graph. WebSockets (Socket.IO) can maintain real-time connections between the simulated vehicles (agents) and update the graph dynamically as agents move and change lanes.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** Use the WebSocket API or Socket.IO to handle the communication between the agents, sending their position and status updates to the server.\n\n**4. Trajectory Planning with JavaScript Libraries:**\n\n* **Scenario:** A robotics simulation in a web browser.\n* **ConvoyLLM application:**  Use a JavaScript math library (like NumJs or Math.js) to implement the distributed control law and calculate the trajectories for each agent based on their desired actions from the LLM and the interlaced formation.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    ```javascript\n    // Simplified example of calculating a trajectory\n    function calculateTrajectory(currentPos, targetPos, speed) {\n      const direction = math.subtract(targetPos, currentPos);\n      const distance = math.norm(direction);\n      const timeToTarget = distance / speed;\n      // ... more sophisticated trajectory calculations\n      return trajectory;\n    }\n    ```\n\n**5. Experimentation and Libraries:**\n\n* **LangChainJS:**  Can be used to manage the interactions with the LLM, construct prompts, and handle the output parsing.\n* **LLM providers:** Explore browser-compatible LLM options or APIs from providers like Hugging Face, Replicate, or OpenAI.\n\n\nThese are just a few starting points.  The key takeaway is to break down the ConvoyLLM concepts (reasoning module, shared memory, local dynamic distributed graph) and find appropriate JavaScript frameworks and libraries to implement them in your web development projects.  This area is still evolving, so experimentation is crucial! Remember to prioritize privacy and security considerations when integrating LLMs and user data in web applications.",
  "pseudocode": "The paper doesn't contain explicit pseudocode blocks.  However, the core logic is described mathematically in equations (1) and (2). These equations can be translated into JavaScript functions.\n\n**Equation (1): Distributed Control Law for Longitudinal and Lateral Movement**\n\nThis equation calculates the control input for each vehicle based on its neighbors' positions, the desired inter-vehicle distance, and the target lane and speed from the reasoning module.\n\n```javascript\nfunction calculateControlInput(egoVehicle, neighbors, targetLane, targetSpeed) {\n  let longitudinalControl = 0;\n  let lateralControl = 0;\n\n  const Dsafe = 10; // Safe distance parameter (from Table 1)\n\n  // Weight coefficients (from Table 1) â€“ can be adjusted\n  const weights = {\n    Wf: 2.0,\n    Wb: 1.0,\n    Wfl: 1.0,\n    Wfr: 1.0,\n    Wbl: 0.1,\n    Wbr: 0.1,\n    Wy: 1.8, \n  };\n\n  for (const neighbor of neighbors) {\n    let desiredDistance = (egoVehicle.lane === neighbor.lane) ? Dsafe : Dsafe / 2;\n    let weight = weights[`W${neighbor.relativePosition}`]; // e.g., 'Wf', 'Wbl'\n\n    if(neighbor.x !== undefined){ //Check if the neighbor exists\n      longitudinalControl += weight * (neighbor.x - egoVehicle.x - desiredDistance);\n    }\n  }\n  lateralControl = weights.Wy * (targetLane - egoVehicle.y);\n\n  // Incorporate target speed\n  longitudinalControl += targetSpeed; // or potentially scale by another weight\n\n  return { longitudinal: longitudinalControl, lateral: lateralControl };\n}\n\n\n// Example usage (assuming you have data structures for vehicles)\nconst egoVehicle = { x: 50, y: 1.8 , lane: 1};  // Example ego vehicle state\nconst neighbors = [\n  { x: 65, lane: 1, relativePosition: 'Wf' },\n  { x: 35, lane: 1, relativePosition: 'Wb' },\n  // ... other neighbors\n];\nconst targetLane = 2;\nconst targetSpeed = 25;\n\nconst controlInput = calculateControlInput(egoVehicle, neighbors, targetLane, targetSpeed);\nconsole.log(controlInput); // Output the calculated control inputs\n\n```\n\n**Purpose:** This function determines how a vehicle should adjust its speed and lane position to maintain the convoy formation, avoid collisions, and move towards its target lane and speed. It's a core part of the multi-agent coordination strategy.\n\n\n\n**Equation (2): Speed Coordination within the Same Lane**\n\nThis equation adjusts a vehicle's speed to match the speed of the vehicle in front of it in the same lane.\n\n```javascript\nfunction adjustSpeed(egoVehicle, frontVehicle) {\n    const Wv = 0.5; // Weight coefficient (from Table 1)\n    if (frontVehicle) {\n        return Wv * (frontVehicle.speed - egoVehicle.speed);\n    }\n    return 0; // no adjustment if there isn't a front vehicle.\n}\n\n// Example usage\nconst egoVehicle = { speed: 20 };\nconst frontVehicle = { speed: 25 };\n\nconst speedAdjustment = adjustSpeed(egoVehicle, frontVehicle);\nconst newSpeed = egoVehicle.speed + speedAdjustment;\n\nconsole.log(\"Speed adjustment:\", speedAdjustment);\nconsole.log(\"New speed:\", newSpeed);\n```\n\n**Purpose:** This ensures smooth and safe following behavior within each lane of the convoy, preventing sudden speed differences that could lead to collisions.\n\n\nThese JavaScript functions represent the core control algorithms described in the paper. You can adapt and integrate them into a larger simulation or multi-agent system framework.  Note that the paper emphasizes the high-level decision-making role of the LLM, so these control functions would work in conjunction with an LLM's output to achieve the overall dynamic convoy control.  Additionally, the paper mentions a trajectory planning module which isn't fully detailed but would be necessary to translate these control signals into actual vehicle trajectories.",
