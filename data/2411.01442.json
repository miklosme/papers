  "title": "Online Relational Inference for Evolving Multi-agent Interacting Systems",
  "abstract": "We introduce a novel framework, Online Relational Inference (ORI), designed to efficiently identify hidden interaction graphs in evolving multi-agent interacting systems using streaming data. Unlike traditional offline methods that rely on a fixed training set, ORI employs online backpropagation, updating the model with each new data point, thereby allowing it to adapt to changing environments in real-time. A key innovation is the use of an adjacency matrix as a trainable parameter, optimized through a new adaptive learning rate technique called AdaRelation, which adjusts based on the historical sensitivity of the decoder to changes in the interaction graph. Additionally, a data augmentation method named Trajectory Mirror (TM) is introduced to improve generalization by exposing the model to varied trajectory patterns. Experimental results on both synthetic datasets and real-world data (CMU MoCap for human motion) demonstrate that ORI significantly improves the accuracy and adaptability of relational inference in dynamic settings compared to existing methods. This approach is model-agnostic, enabling seamless integration with various neural relational inference (NRI) architectures, and offers a robust solution for real-time applications in complex, evolving systems. Code is available at https://github.com/beomseokg/ORI.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces Online Relational Inference (ORI), a new method for identifying the hidden relationships between agents in a multi-agent system as it changes over time, using only the agents' observable actions (trajectories).  It's like figuring out how different parts of a machine interact just by watching the machine operate, even if the parts start interacting differently over time.\n\nKey points for LLM-based multi-agent systems:\n\n* **Adaptability to changing environments:** ORI is designed to adapt to evolving agent interactions, unlike existing offline methods. This is crucial for real-world multi-agent systems where relationships aren't static.\n* **Real-time processing of streaming data:** ORI updates its understanding of agent relationships with each new piece of data, making it suitable for real-time applications.\n* **Model-agnostic approach:** ORI can be integrated with various existing multi-agent models (including those using LLMs), offering flexibility in architecture.\n* **Adaptive learning rate:** ORI introduces \"AdaRelation,\" a technique to dynamically adjust the learning rate based on how agent interactions are changing, crucial for stable and efficient learning in dynamic environments.\n* **Data augmentation:** \"Trajectory Mirror\" enhances model generalization by creating variations in the observed data, improving the ability to identify correct relationships regardless of the perspective from which agents' actions are observed.\n* **Potential for improved interpretability:** While primarily focused on accurate relationship inference, initial results suggest ORI might offer better interpretability compared to some existing methods.  This could be valuable for understanding *why* LLMs in a multi-agent system make certain decisions.",
  "takeaways": "This paper introduces Online Relational Inference (ORI), a method for dynamically inferring relationships between agents in a multi-agent system. Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights to LLM-based multi-agent projects in web development:\n\n**1. Dynamic Relationship Updates in Collaborative Web Apps:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine a collaborative document editing app like Google Docs where multiple users (agents) interact. ORI can be used to infer the relationships between users based on their actions (e.g., editing the same paragraph, commenting on each other's work).\n* **Implementation:**\n    * **Frontend (JavaScript):** Use a library like `vis-network` or `sigma.js` to visualize the dynamic interaction graph between users. The graph updates in real-time as ORI infers new relationships based on user actions streamed to the backend.\n    * **Backend (Node.js):** Implement ORI using TensorFlow.js or a similar library. Stream user actions (e.g., text edits, comments) as input to the ORI model. The model outputs the updated adjacency matrix, which is then sent to the frontend for visualization.\n* **Benefits:** Understanding dynamic relationships can enhance collaboration features. For example, the app could highlight related edits by different users or suggest relevant collaborators based on inferred relationships.\n\n**2. Personalized Content Recommendations in E-commerce:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  An e-commerce site with multiple chatbots (agents) assisting customers. ORI can infer relationships between chatbots based on customer interactions and product recommendations.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * **Frontend (React/Vue.js):**  Integrate with the chatbot UI.  Display related product recommendations generated by related chatbots.\n    * **Backend (Node.js):** Implement ORI. Log chatbot interactions (e.g., product views, questions asked) and recommendations. Train ORI to infer relationships between chatbots based on shared customer interests and successful recommendations.\n* **Benefits:** Improves recommendation quality and diversity by leveraging the collective knowledge of related chatbots.\n\n**3. Adaptive Learning for Multi-Agent Game Development:**\n\n* **Scenario:** A browser-based multiplayer game with AI-controlled characters (agents). ORI can be used to infer dynamic relationships between characters based on their in-game actions and adapt their strategies.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * **Frontend (Phaser.js/Babylon.js):** Integrate ORI with the game engine.  Update character behavior based on the inferred relationships.\n    * **Backend (Node.js):** Implement ORI. Use game events (e.g., attacks, healing, movement) as input to ORI.  The model infers relationships (e.g., alliances, rivalries) between characters. These relationships influence character decision-making (e.g., targeting enemies, offering support to allies).\n* **Benefits:** Creates more dynamic and engaging gameplay with evolving character relationships.\n\n**Key JavaScript Concepts and Libraries:**\n\n* **TensorFlow.js:** For implementing the ORI model in the browser or Node.js backend.\n* **WebSockets:** For real-time communication between frontend and backend to stream user actions and update the interaction graph.\n* **Graph Visualization Libraries (`vis-network`, `sigma.js`):** For visualizing the dynamic interaction graph on the frontend.\n* **Frontend Frameworks (React, Vue.js, Angular):** For building interactive user interfaces that integrate with the ORI model and visualization.\n* **Game Engines (Phaser.js, Babylon.js):** For integrating ORI with browser-based games.\n\n**Example Code Snippet (Conceptual):**\n\n```javascript\n// Frontend (using TensorFlow.js and vis-network)\n// ... import libraries\n\nconst model = await tf.loadLayersModel('ori_model.json'); // Load pre-trained ORI model\n\n// Websocket to receive updates from backend\nsocket.on('relationUpdate', (adjacencyMatrix) => {\n  // Update the visualization with the new adjacency matrix\n  network.setData({ edges: adjacencyMatrixToEdges(adjacencyMatrix) }); \n});\n\n// Send user actions to backend\nconst userAction = { type: 'edit', documentId: 1, paragraphId: 5 };\nsocket.emit('userAction', userAction);\n\n\n// Backend (Node.js and TensorFlow.js)\n// ... import libraries\n\nsocket.on('userAction', async (userAction) => {\n  // ... preprocess user action\n\n  const updatedAdjacencyMatrix = await model.predict(tf.tensor(userAction));\n\n  socket.emit('relationUpdate', updatedAdjacencyMatrix.arraySync());\n});\n\n```\n\nBy implementing these concepts, JavaScript developers can leverage the power of ORI to build more dynamic, personalized, and engaging web applications with LLM-based multi-agent systems. Remember that the above code is highly conceptual; adapting ORI for specific LLM scenarios requires detailed implementation work. Implementing AdaRelation and Trajectory Mirror further enhances ORI's performance, especially in dynamically changing web environments.",

Use the currentLearningRate in your model's adjacency matrix update ...\n}\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Explanation of AdaRelation Algorithm and its Purpose:**\n\nThe AdaRelation algorithm is designed to adaptively adjust the learning rate used for updating the adjacency matrix in online relational inference.  Its purpose is to improve the model's ability to track evolving relationships between agents in a multi-agent system.\n\n**Key Concepts and Steps:**\n\n1. **Initialization:** The algorithm initializes with a starting learning rate, upper and lower bounds for the learning rate, a threshold (`e`), and an adaptation step size (`a`).  It also maintains a history of past adjacency matrices.\n\n2. **Update Learning Rate:** In each training iteration, the algorithm receives the current adjacency matrix from the model. It calculates the L1-norm difference ( `D1(t)` in the paper) between the current adjacency matrix and the adjacency matrix from `w` time steps ago. This difference reflects how much the predicted interaction strengths have changed.\n\n3. **Adaptive Adjustment:**  If the L1-norm difference is greater than the threshold `e`, it means the predicted relationships are changing rapidly.  In this case, the algorithm decreases the learning rate (using the adaptation step size `a`).  This helps to stabilize the learning process and prevents overshooting.\n\n4.  If the L1-norm difference is less than or equal to the threshold, the learning rate is increased (by `a`).  This allows the model to adapt more quickly when the relationships are evolving more slowly.\n\n\n5. **Clipping:** The updated learning rate is clipped to stay within the specified lower and upper bounds. This ensures the learning rate remains within a reasonable range.\n\n**Benefits of AdaRelation:**\n\n* **Improved Adaptability:** AdaRelation allows the model to adjust to both fast and slow changes in the relationships between agents.\n* **Enhanced Stability:** By reducing the learning rate during periods of rapid change, AdaRelation helps prevent instability in the learning process.\n* **Faster Convergence:** By increasing the learning rate when appropriate, AdaRelation can potentially speed up the model's convergence to the optimal solution.\n\n\nThe provided JavaScript code implements the AdaRelation algorithm. The example usage section demonstrates how to integrate it into a training loop. Note that the example uses random adjacency matrices for illustration. In a real application, you would use the adjacency matrix output from your model. Also, the example usage code requires you to adapt it to your specific model architecture and training framework.  You would replace the placeholder comment with the actual adjacency matrix update logic from your model.  The key is to use the `currentLearningRate` returned by the `adaRelation.getLearningRate()` method to control the update step of your adjacency matrix.",
