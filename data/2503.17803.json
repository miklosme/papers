  "title": "A ROADMAP TOWARDS IMPROVING MULTI-AGENT REINFORCEMENT LEARNING WITH CAUSAL DISCOVERY AND INFERENCE",
  "abstract": "Causal reasoning is increasingly used in Reinforcement Learning (RL) to improve the learning process in several dimensions: efficacy of learned policies, efficiency of convergence, generalisation capabilities, safety and interpretability of behaviour. However, applications of causal reasoning to Multi-Agent RL (MARL) are still mostly unexplored. In this paper, we take the first step in investigating the opportunities and challenges of applying causal reasoning in MARL. We measure the impact of a simple form of causal augmentation in state-of-the-art MARL scenarios increasingly requiring cooperation, and with state-of-the-art MARL algorithms exploiting various degrees of collaboration between agents. Then, we discuss the positive as well as negative results achieved, giving us the chance to outline the areas where further research may help to successfully transfer causal RL to the multi-agent setting.",
  "summary": "This paper explores using causal reasoning to improve multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL).  It proposes a framework called Causality-Driven Reinforcement Learning (CDRL) that learns a simplified causal model of the environment dynamics (how actions influence states and rewards) and then uses this model to filter out risky actions and guide agents towards better outcomes.  Experiments showed mixed results: while the causal augmentation improved performance in some tasks, particularly for independent learners in less cooperative scenarios, it struggled when agents needed to heavily collaborate.\n\n\nKey points for LLM-based multi-agent systems:\n\n* Causal reasoning can potentially improve the efficacy, efficiency, and safety of MARL policies, especially in less cooperative scenarios or when safety is a primary concern.\n* Learning and leveraging a causal model of the environment can provide valuable insights into how actions influence outcomes, which aligns with the goal of creating more interpretable and predictable LLM agents.\n* Applying causal discovery to LLM-based agents raises challenges, including the computational complexity of causal discovery in high-dimensional spaces and the issue of validating the learned causal models.\n* The paper highlights the potential for integrating causal reasoning with various MARL algorithms, even those using deep learning, offering avenues for enhancing current LLM-based multi-agent systems.\n* The paper's focus on interventions and counterfactual reasoning, which are key concepts in causality, provides a solid theoretical foundation for building LLM agents capable of reasoning about the consequences of their actions.",
  "takeaways": "This paper explores using causal discovery and inference to improve multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in web development contexts, focusing on LLM-based agents. Here are practical examples for JavaScript developers working with LLMs in multi-agent scenarios:\n\n**1. Collaborative Content Creation:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Multiple LLM agents collaborate on writing a story, article, or code.  One agent might focus on plot, another on dialogue, and a third on style.\n* **Causal Inference for Action Filtering:**  Each agent can use a causal model (represented as a Bayesian Network in JavaScript using a library like `bayesian.js`) to predict the impact of its actions (e.g., adding a sentence) on the overall quality (reward signal). Actions predicted to negatively impact the reward, such as introducing inconsistencies or stylistic clashes, can be filtered out or modified.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** The client-side interface (e.g., using React or Vue) could display suggestions from each agent, highlighting those approved by the causal filter.  Agents could communicate using a message broker like Redis, and the causal inference could be implemented as a Node.js microservice.\n\n**2. Multi-Agent Chatbots for Customer Service:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  Several LLM-powered chatbots handle different aspects of customer interaction: one for order tracking, one for technical support, and another for general inquiries.\n* **Causal Discovery and Routing:** Analyze past chatbot interactions to discover causal relationships between customer queries and chatbot responses.  Build a causal model to predict which chatbot is best suited for a given query based on predicted customer satisfaction (reward).\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**  A Node.js server could host the causal model and routing logic.  Incoming chat messages would be routed to the most appropriate chatbot using a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ) based on the causal inference.\n\n**3. Interactive Game Development:**\n\n* **Scenario:** LLM-based agents act as non-player characters (NPCs) in a browser-based game. The NPCs interact with each other and the human player.\n* **Causal Inference for NPC Behavior:** NPCs can use causal models to predict how their actions (e.g., movement, dialogue, combat) affect the game state and player experience (reward).  This allows NPCs to make more realistic and engaging decisions, like forming alliances, trading, or avoiding conflict based on predicted outcomes.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** The game logic could be implemented in a JavaScript game engine like Phaser or Babylon.js. Causal inference could be performed by individual NPCs on the client-side using TensorFlow.js or WebAssembly-based libraries for Bayesian Network inference.\n\n**4. Personalized Web Experiences:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  LLM agents manage different aspects of website personalization, including content recommendation, ad placement, and user interface customization.\n* **Causal Discovery and Intervention:** Analyze user behavior data to uncover causal relationships between website features and user engagement (reward). This could involve A/B testing different layouts, recommending various content types, or changing ad placements. LLMs can use the learnt causal models to intervene on website design and optimize the user experience.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** Client-side JavaScript code (e.g., using a framework like Next.js) could interact with a server-side API (e.g., built with Node.js and Express) that hosts the causal model and personalization logic.\n\n**Key Libraries and Frameworks:**\n\n* **TensorFlow.js:** For implementing and deploying neural networks related to causal inference in the browser.\n* **WebAssembly:**  For running computationally intensive causal inference algorithms with near-native speed in the browser.\n* **Bayesian.js:**  For working with Bayesian Networks in JavaScript.\n* **Node.js, Express, RabbitMQ, Redis:**  For building server-side infrastructure for multi-agent communication and coordination.\n* **React, Vue, Next.js, Phaser, Babylon.js:** For building engaging user interfaces and browser-based applications that integrate LLM agents.\n\n\nBy using these examples and technologies, JavaScript developers can begin experimenting with causal MARL for LLM-based multi-agent systems and contribute to the development of more sophisticated and intelligent web applications. Remember to consult the linked research paper for detailed implementation and further research directions mentioned in the roadmap.",

Its purpose is to leverage a learned Causal Bayesian Network (CBN) to guide action selection by filtering out less desirable actions and promoting more promising ones.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n1. **Conditioning the Markov Blanket:** The function receives the CBN and the current observation as input. It first identifies the Markov Blanket of the reward node in the CBN.  The Markov Blanket consists of the parents, children, and children's parents of a node. It provides all the information necessary to predict the value of that node. The code then sets the values of the nodes in the Markov Blanket according to the current observation.\n\n2. **Computing Reward Inference Data Structure:**  This step simulates interventions (using Pearl's do-operator) on each action variable. It iterates through all possible values of each action, sets the action variable to that value in the CBN, and computes the resulting probability distribution of the reward variable. These distributions are stored in the `rewardInference` object, allowing the agent to predict the consequences of its actions.\n\n3. **Computing Likability Scores:** The code calculates a \"likability score\" for each action-value pair. The score is calculated as the expected reward, weighted by the probability distribution of the reward obtained in step 2. Higher likability scores indicate actions that are more likely to lead to higher rewards.\n\n4. **Computing Action Mask:** This part implements the action filtering logic.  The example code uses a percentile-based strategy. It filters out actions whose likability scores are below the 25th percentile. If there are actions with scores above the 75th percentile, it only selects among those, further promoting high-reward actions. The specific filtering strategy can be customized.\n\n5. **Returning the Action Mask:** The function returns the `actionMask`, which dictates the admissible actions for the agent in the current state. This mask can then be used to constrain the action selection process of the RL algorithm, guiding it towards more promising actions according to the learned causal model.\n\nThis causal inference process effectively incorporates causal knowledge into the decision-making of the RL agent. It uses the CBN to reason about the potential outcomes of its actions and strategically restricts its choices to improve the chances of achieving higher rewards or desired states. This approach is expected to enhance the learning efficiency, efficacy, and potentially the safety of the RL agents.",
