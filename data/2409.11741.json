  "title": "HARP: Human-Assisted Regrouping with Permutation Invariant Critic for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning",
  "abstract": "Abstract-Human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning integrates human expertise to accelerate agent learning and provide critical guidance and feedback in complex fields. However, many existing approaches focus on single-agent tasks and require continuous human involvement during the training process, significantly increasing the human workload and limiting scalability. In this paper, we propose HARP (Human-Assisted Regrouping with Permutation Invariant Critic), a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework designed for group-oriented tasks. HARP integrates automatic agent regrouping with strategic human assistance during deployment, enabling and allowing non-experts to offer effective guidance with minimal intervention. During training, agents dynamically adjust their groupings to optimize collaborative task completion. When deployed, they actively seek human assistance and utilize the Permutation Invariant Group Critic to evaluate and refine human-proposed groupings, allowing non-expert users to contribute valuable suggestions. In multiple collaboration scenarios, our approach is able to leverage limited guidance from non-experts and enhance performance. The project can be found at https://github.com/huawen-hu/HARP.",
  "summary": "This paper presents HARP, a new system for improving multi-agent teamwork in AI. HARP lets non-expert humans give feedback on how agents are grouped, leading to better strategies than AI alone. This is especially useful in complex tasks like StarCraft II, where HARP achieved a 100% win rate. \n\nKey to HARP's success are: 1) dynamic regrouping: agents can be rearranged based on human feedback, making the system adaptable, and 2) a \"permutation invariant\" approach: HARP understands the roles of agents within a group, no matter their order, leading to more robust strategy suggestions. This is promising for future work where LLMs could give feedback based on analyzing different data sources.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents a novel approach to multi-agent reinforcement learning that is highly relevant to JavaScript developers building LLM-based AI systems for the web. Let's break down how a JavaScript developer can leverage its insights:\n\n**1. Dynamic Agent Grouping with LLM-based Coordination:**\n\n* Imagine you're building a collaborative web application for tasks like code review using LLMs. You can use the concept of dynamic grouping to form teams of LLM agents specialized in different aspects (e.g., code style, security vulnerabilities, code optimization).\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** Use a graph data structure (e.g., `vis.js` or `cytoscape.js`) to visually represent agents and their relationships. Implement the \"Select and Kick\" algorithm using JavaScript to dynamically adjust these groupings based on LLM agent contributions (e.g., measured by the relevance or accuracy of their code review suggestions).\n\n**2.  Human-in-the-Loop Feedback with GUI Integration:**\n\n* In the code review example, the system can identify when the variance of LLM agent suggestions is high (indicating uncertainty or disagreement). At this point, it can proactively seek feedback from human developers through a well-designed GUI.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** Integrate a JavaScript frontend framework like React, Vue, or Svelte to build an intuitive interface that visualizes LLM agent suggestions and allows developers to provide feedback (e.g., upvote/downvote suggestions, provide additional comments, or manually regroup agents).\n\n**3. Permutation Invariant Group Critic for LLM Evaluation:**\n\n*  LLMs don't perceive information in a fixed order. Use the Permutation Invariant Group Critic (PIGC) concept to evaluate the performance of LLM groups regardless of the order in which they generate suggestions.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** Adapt the PIGC idea by representing LLM interactions as a graph. Use JavaScript libraries like TensorFlow.js or Brain.js to implement a graph convolutional network (GCN) that learns to evaluate group performance based on this graph structure.\n\n**Practical Web Development Scenarios:**\n\n* **Collaborative Content Creation:** Build a platform where human users and LLM agents collaborate to write stories, articles, or marketing copy. Dynamic grouping ensures teams of LLMs with complementary skills are formed.\n* **Real-Time Strategy Games:** Develop browser-based games where teams of LLM agents compete against each other or human players. Use dynamic grouping and human feedback to improve agent coordination and strategy over time. \n* **Personalized Educational Experiences:** Create interactive learning platforms where LLM agents adapt to each student's learning style and pace. Dynamically group LLMs specializing in different subjects or teaching methods.\n\n**Key Takeaways for JavaScript Developers:**\n\n* **LLMs as Team Players:**  Think of LLMs not as individual entities but as agents that can be dynamically grouped to work together.\n* **Human-AI Collaboration:**  Design your applications from the ground up to seamlessly integrate human feedback, especially when LLM agents face uncertainty.\n* **Don't Reinvent the Wheel:** Leverage existing JavaScript libraries for graph visualization, frontend development, and machine learning to implement these concepts effectively.\n\nBy applying the insights from this paper, JavaScript developers can be at the forefront of creating innovative and intelligent web applications powered by the collaborative power of LLMs and human intelligence.",
  "pseudocode": "```javascript\nwhile (!terminate) {\n  // Get the current state and Q-values from the agent network\n  const [ht, Q] = agentNetwork.getOutputs(); \n\n  // Load the current group index \n  const G = loadGroupIndex();\n\n  // Calculate the variance of group return using equation (8) \n  const groupVariance = calculateGroupVariance(G, Q);\n\n  if (groupVariance > threshold) { \n    let done = false;\n    while (!done) {\n      // Get new group index and actions from human feedback\n      const [Ghuman, uhuman] = getHumanInput(); \n\n      // Calculate new group Q-values using the Permutation Invariant Group Critic\n      const QGhuman = permutationInvariantGroupCritic(Ghuman); \n\n      // If the human-suggested grouping leads to higher Q-values, accept the suggestion\n      if (QGhuman > QG) { \n        done = true;\n      }\n    }\n    // Execute the actions suggested by the human\n    executeActions(uhuman); \n  } else {\n    // If the variance is within acceptable limits, continue with the agent's own actions\n    const u = argmax(Q); \n    executeActions(u);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThis JavaScript code implements the **HARP Deployment Algorithm** (Algorithm 1 in the provided research paper). \n\n**Purpose:**\n\nThis algorithm aims to improve the performance of a multi-agent system during deployment by incorporating human feedback for dynamic agent grouping adjustments. \n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. **Agent Action Selection:** The agent network processes the current state (ht) and outputs Q-values (Q) representing the expected reward for each possible action.\n2. **Variance Calculation:** It calculates the variance of group return (`groupVariance`) using a predefined function `calculateGroupVariance`. This variance indicates the stability and effectiveness of the current grouping strategy.\n3. **Human Intervention Request:** If the variance exceeds a predefined threshold, the system actively seeks human intervention through the `getHumanInput()` function.\n4. **Human Feedback Evaluation:**  The system receives new group indices (`Ghuman`) and corresponding actions (`uhuman`) from human feedback. It then evaluates the quality of this feedback by calculating the expected Q-values (`QGhuman`) for the human-suggested grouping using the Permutation Invariant Group Critic.\n5. **Action Execution:** If the human-suggested grouping leads to higher Q-values than the current grouping, the system accepts and executes the human-suggested actions (`uhuman`). Otherwise, the system continues with the agent's own actions based on the highest calculated Q-value.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Human-in-the-loop Learning:** This algorithm actively integrates human feedback to guide the learning process, particularly in situations where the agent's own decision-making is uncertain.\n* **Dynamic Agent Grouping:** The algorithm dynamically adjusts the grouping of agents based on the task's demands and the effectiveness of different grouping strategies.\n* **Permutation Invariant Group Critic:** This component ensures that the evaluation of group performance is not sensitive to the order in which agents are arranged within a group, allowing for more robust and consistent evaluation of human feedback.",
