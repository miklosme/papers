  "title": "Agentic Business Process Management: The Past 30 Years And Practitioners' Future Perspectives",
  "abstract": "Abstract. With the advent of generative Artificial Intelligence (genAI), the notion of an agent has seen a resurgence in popularity. This has also led to speculation about the extent to which business process management, as a discipline and research field, may impact and be impacted by the deployment of genAI-based agents. To better ground such speculations into the state-of-the-art, we draw from the past 30 years of research on agents and business process management to establish the concept of Agentic Business Process Management (agentic BPM) that is only loosely coupled to the genAI hype. We conduct a series of interviews with BPM practitioners to explore their understanding, expectations, and concerns related to agent autonomy, adaptability, human collaboration, and governance in processes. The findings reflect both challenges with respect to data inconsistencies, manual interventions, identification of process bottlenecks, actionability of process improvements, as well as the opportunities of enhanced efficiency, predictive process insights and proactive decision-making support. While the technology offers potential benefits, practitioners also anticipate risks such as biases, over-reliance, lack of transparency, and job displacement within organizations. These concerns underscore the need for a robust methodological framework for managing agents in organizations.",
  "summary": "This paper explores the concept of Agentic Business Process Management (ABPM), which involves using autonomous software agents to achieve business goals and applying agent-based concepts to design and analyze these agents.  It reviews the history of agents in BPM, from early goal-oriented agents to RPA and the current resurgence with LLM-based agents.\n\nKey points relevant to LLM-based multi-agent systems include:\n* LLMs are driving a new wave of interest in agent-based systems for BPM.\n* Agentic BPM aims to integrate agents into business processes while retaining human oversight and control.\n* Practitioner interviews reveal perceived benefits of agentic AI such as efficiency, data quality, and compliance, but also concerns like bias, over-reliance, job displacement, and lack of transparency.\n* Key requirements highlighted are clear rules and guidelines, human-agent collaboration frameworks, and customization options for agent autonomy.\n*  Adaptability is seen as crucial but needs careful management through transparency and oversight.  \n*  A robust methodological framework is needed to manage these systems effectively.",
  "takeaways": "This paper advocates for Agentic Business Process Management (ABPM), a framework for managing autonomous agents within business processes.  For JavaScript developers working with LLM-based multi-agent systems, this translates to practical considerations for design, development, and deployment. Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply the paper's insights:\n\n**1. Defining Clear Business Goals and Context:**\n\n* **Practical Example:** Imagine building a multi-agent customer support system for a website.  The business goal is to resolve customer issues faster and improve satisfaction. Each agent might specialize in different product areas or support tasks.  Define these goals and specializations clearly in your JavaScript code, perhaps using configuration files or a dedicated module that outlines agent roles and objectives.\n\n**2. Implementing Guardrails and Governance:**\n\n* **Practical Example:** To prevent agents from going off-track or performing unintended actions (e.g., offering inappropriate discounts), implement constraints in your JavaScript code. For example, if an agent needs to access sensitive customer data, ensure authorization checks are implemented using libraries like `jsonwebtoken` or OAuth 2.0 implementations.  Log agent actions for auditing and transparency.\n\n**3. Facilitating Human-Agent Collaboration:**\n\n* **Practical Example:** Design your agents to request human intervention when they encounter complex or ambiguous scenarios. Use WebSockets (e.g., with `socket.io`) to create real-time communication channels between agents and human operators. Display agent reasoning to the operator (e.g., \"I'm recommending this solution because...\") using JavaScript UI frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular.\n\n**4. Customization and Adaptability:**\n\n* **Practical Example:** Design your agent architecture with modularity and flexibility in mind. Use a component-based approach with JavaScript frameworks to facilitate customization of agent behavior for different contexts. Employ environment variables or configuration files to adjust agent parameters dynamically.\n\n**5. Managing Risks and Fallback Mechanisms:**\n\n* **Practical Example:** Use JavaScript's `try...catch` blocks extensively to handle errors and unexpected behavior from LLMs.  Implement rate limiting to prevent runaway agent actions.  Create a \"circuit breaker\" pattern to disable agents that consistently fail or behave erratically.  Provide a fallback mechanism, such as transferring the interaction to a human operator, when an agent encounters critical errors.\n\n**6. Experimentation and Monitoring:**\n\n* **Practical Example:**  Use A/B testing frameworks to evaluate the performance of different agent strategies or LLM prompts.  Monitor agent behavior using logging and analytics tools. Integrate with existing website analytics to measure the impact of agents on business metrics like conversion rates or customer satisfaction.\n\n**JavaScript Libraries and Frameworks:**\n\n* **Langchain.js:**  For building and chaining LLM interactions and managing prompts.\n* **LlamaIndex.js:**  For connecting LLMs to your data and enabling data-aware reasoning.\n* **React/Vue/Angular:**  For building interactive user interfaces for human-agent collaboration.\n* **Socket.io:** For real-time communication between agents and human operators.\n* **Node.js:** For server-side implementation of agents and management logic.\n* **Cloud Platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP):** Provide serverless functions and managed services to deploy and scale multi-agent systems.\n\n**Example Scenario: E-commerce Product Recommendation Agent:**\n\nA JavaScript developer could build a multi-agent system where each agent specializes in recommending products based on different user preferences (e.g., price sensitivity, brand loyalty, style).  The agents could collaborate by sharing user context and refining recommendations. The developer can use Langchain.js or LlamaIndex.js to manage the LLM interactions, React to build the user interface, and Node.js to implement the agent logic.  Guardrails could be implemented to prevent agents from recommending out-of-stock or unavailable items.\n\nBy considering these examples and leveraging relevant JavaScript tools, developers can practically apply the ABPM framework to build robust, effective, and manageable LLM-based multi-agent systems for the web.",
