  "title": "Accelerating Manufacturing Scale-Up from Material Discovery Using Agentic Web Navigation and Retrieval-Augmented AI for Process Engineering Schematics Design",
  "abstract": "Process Flow Diagrams (PFDs) and Process and Instrumentation Diagrams (PIDs) are critical tools for industrial process design, control, and safety. However, the generation of precise and regulation-compliant diagrams remains a significant challenge, particularly in scaling breakthroughs from material discovery to industrial production in an era of automation and digitalization. This paper introduces an autonomous agentic framework to address these challenges through a two-stage approach involving knowledge acquisition and generation. The framework integrates specialized sub-agents for retrieving and synthesizing multimodal data from publicly available online sources and constructs ontological knowledge graphs using a Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) paradigm. These capabilities enable the automation of diagram generation and open-domain question answering (ODQA) tasks with high contextual accuracy. Extensive empirical experiments demonstrate the framework's ability to deliver regulation-compliant diagrams with minimal expert intervention, highlighting its practical utility for industrial applications.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces a two-stage framework using a multi-agent system and a Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) approach to automate the creation of Process Flow Diagrams (PFDs) and Process & Instrumentation Diagrams (PIDs) for chemical processes.  This addresses the challenge of scaling material discoveries to industrial production.\n\nKey points for LLM-based multi-agent systems: Specialized sub-agents autonomously gather information from online sources (images, scholarly articles, patents, wikis, etc.) using SerpAPI and LLMs.  A meta-agent coordinates these sub-agents and uses feedback from human experts and a \"Gold\" LLM to refine the collected knowledge.  This information is then structured into an ontological knowledge graph using Graph RAG, which enables efficient retrieval and complex question-answering about PFD/PID generation, overcoming limitations of traditional RAG. This framework allows for automated generation of diagrams and precise answers to technical questions, bridging the gap between computational design and real-world industrial implementation.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents a valuable framework for JavaScript developers working with LLM-powered multi-agent systems, especially in domains requiring knowledge synthesis like engineering or research. Here's how its insights can be applied practically:\n\n**1. Agentic Web Navigation with JavaScript:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine building a multi-agent app where agents research and synthesize information about a new chemical compound for industrial production.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * **Specialized Agents:** Create JavaScript classes (e.g., `ImageAgent`, `ScholarAgent`, `PatentAgent`) with distinct functionalities.  Each agent utilizes a web scraping library like `Cheerio` or `Puppeteer` alongside a search API (e.g., SerpAPI, Google Custom Search API) to query specific sources (Google Images, Google Scholar, PatentsView).\n    * **LLM Integration:**  Integrate with a LLM API (e.g., OpenAI, Cohere) within each agent to process retrieved data (text, images) and generate concise summaries. Libraries like `LangChain` and `LlamaIndex` can be extremely useful for this.\n    * **Meta-Agent Coordination:** Implement a `MetaAgent` class to manage sub-agents.  Use asynchronous JavaScript (`async`/`await`) to execute agent tasks concurrently and efficiently aggregate results. Libraries like `node-schedule` can be used to schedule and prioritize tasks.\n\n```javascript\n// Example (simplified) using LangChain & Puppeteer\nimport { OpenAI } from \"langchain/llms/openai\";\nimport { PuppeteerWebBaseLoader } from \"langchain/document_loaders/web/puppeteer\";\n\nclass ScholarAgent {\n  async getSummary(query) {\n    const loader = new PuppeteerWebBaseLoader(\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=\" + query);\n    const docs = await loader.load();\n    const llm = new OpenAI();\n    const summary = await llm.call(docs.map((doc) => doc.pageContent).join(\"\\n\"));\n    return summary;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n**2. Graph RAG Implementation in JavaScript:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Enable your multi-agent app to answer complex questions about the synthesized chemical compound information, requiring multi-hop reasoning.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * **Knowledge Graph Creation:** Use a JavaScript graph database library like `Neo4j-driver` or a client-side graph library like `vis.js` to store the extracted information as a knowledge graph. Represent entities and relationships as nodes and edges.\n    * **Graph Traversal & Querying:** Implement logic to traverse the graph based on user questions. Use a graph traversal algorithm (e.g., breadth-first search, depth-first search) to find relevant information. Libraries like `Cypher.js` can be used to formulate queries against Neo4j.\n    * **LLM-powered Answer Generation:** Combine retrieved information from the graph with the user's question and feed it to the LLM to generate contextually relevant answers.\n\n```javascript\n// Example (conceptual) of graph query & LLM integration\nasync function answerQuestion(question, graph) {\n  const relevantNodes = graph.findNodes(question); // Simplified graph traversal\n  const paths = graph.findPaths(relevantNodes); // Simplified path finding\n  const context = paths.map((path) => path.toString()).join(\"\\n\");\n  const llm = new OpenAI();\n  const answer = await llm.call(`${question}\\n${context}`);\n  return answer;\n}\n\n```\n\n**3. Feedback Loop Integration:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Continuously improve the accuracy and quality of information retrieved and generated by your agents.\n* **Implementation:**\n    * **User Feedback:** Implement UI elements for users to provide feedback on agent responses.\n    * **LLM as Judge:** Use a separate LLM as a judge to evaluate agent outputs based on predefined criteria (helpfulness, correctness, etc.). Use embeddings to compare similarity and consistency of outputs.\n    * **Reinforcement Learning (Optional):**  For advanced applications, consider implementing a reinforcement learning loop in JavaScript to train agents based on feedback, improving their performance over time. Libraries like `ReinforceJS` could be a starting point.\n\n\n**Key JavaScript Libraries & Frameworks:**\n\n* **LLM Integration:** `LangChain`, `LlamaIndex`\n* **Web Scraping:** `Cheerio`, `Puppeteer`\n* **Search APIs:** SerpAPI, Google Custom Search API\n* **Graph Databases:** `Neo4j-driver`, `vis.js`, `Cypher.js`\n* **Asynchronous Operations:** `async`/`await`, Promises\n* **Scheduling:** `node-schedule`\n* **Reinforcement Learning (Advanced):** `ReinforceJS`\n\nBy adopting these practices, JavaScript developers can build robust, scalable, and intelligent multi-agent applications, leveraging the power of LLMs and knowledge graphs for enhanced web development experiences. Remember to focus on modularity and maintain clear separation of concerns between agent functionalities, LLM interactions, and knowledge graph management. This will make your code easier to maintain, debug, and extend.",
  "pseudocode": "The provided text includes two algorithms written in pseudocode. Here are their JavaScript equivalents along with explanations:\n\n**Algorithm 1: Autonomous Agentic Web Navigation Framework for Knowledge Generation**\n\n```javascript\nasync function autonomousAgenticWebNavigation(Q) {\n  // Q: Query related to PFDs or PIDs on primary dataset\n\n  const metaAgent = new MetaAgent(Q); // Initialize Meta-Agent with task Q\n  const subtasks = decomposeQuery(Q); // Decompose Q into subtasks\n\n  const results = {};\n  for (const qi of subtasks) {\n    let bestAgent = null;\n    let maxSimilarity = -1;\n\n    for (const tj of metaAgent.subAgents) {\n      const v_qi = await embedText(qi); // Embedding of the subtask query\n      const v_dj = await embedText(tj.capabilities); // Embedding of the agent's capabilities\n\n      const similarity = cosineSimilarity(v_qi, v_dj);\n\n      if (similarity > maxSimilarity) {\n        maxSimilarity = similarity;\n        bestAgent = tj;\n      }\n    }\n\n    const params = {\n      instructions: \"Instructions for the sub-agent\", // Example instruction\n      context: \"Relevant context\", // Example context\n      specificQuery: qi,\n    };\n\n    results[qi] = await bestAgent.invoke(params);\n  }\n\n  // Manage dependencies using DAG (using a library like 'dagre' is recommended)\n  const dag = new DAG();\n  for (const qi of subtasks) {\n    dag.addNode(qi);\n  }\n  // Add edges based on dependencies between subtasks - omitted for brevity\n\n  const sortedTasks = dag.topologicalSort();\n\n\n    const agentOutputs = {};\n\n    for(const task of sortedTasks) {\n        const tj = getAgentForTask(task, metaAgent);\n        const result = await processSubtask(task, tj, results[task])\n        agentOutputs[task] = result\n\n    }\n\n  let A = await metaAgent.aggregate(agentOutputs); // Initial knowledge aggregation\n\n  let i = 0;\n  while (i < MAX_ITERATIONS && !meetsQualityStandards(A)) {\n    const feedback = await getFeedback(A); // from experts and benchmark models\n    A = await metaAgent.aggregateWithFeedback(Q, A, feedback)\n    i++;\n  }\n\n  return A; // Optimized generated knowledge\n}\n\n\n\n// Helper functions (examples - you'll need to implement these based on your needs)\nasync function embedText(text) {\n    // Use a library like 'transformers.js' to generate embeddings.  \n    return [0.1, 0.2, 0.3]; // Example embedding.\n}\n\nfunction cosineSimilarity(vec1, vec2) {\n   // calculate cosine similarity\n    return 0.9; // Example similarity score\n}\n\nclass MetaAgent {\n\n    constructor(Q) {\n        this.Q = Q;\n        this.subAgents = [\n            new ImageAgent(),\n            new ScholarAgent(),\n            // etc.\n        ]\n    }\n    //other methods omitted for brevity.\n}\n\nclass ImageAgent {\n    async invoke(params) { /*Implementation omitted*/ }\n\n}\n\n\n// Etc for other agent types.\n\n```\n\n\n\n**Explanation:** This algorithm orchestrates multiple specialized agents to gather information about PFDs and PIDs. A meta-agent breaks down a user's query into subtasks and assigns them to appropriate sub-agents (e.g., image agent, scholar agent). Each sub-agent retrieves relevant data from its domain using SerpAPI and processes it with LLMs. The meta-agent then combines the results, refines them through a feedback loop (using human experts and a reward model), and outputs the final, optimized knowledge.\n\n**Algorithm 2: Knowledge Graph Construction and Utilization in ODQA**\n\n```javascript\nasync function knowledgeGraphConstructionAndUtilization(documents, query, w, s, tSim, tStr) {\n\n  const graph = new Graph();\n\n  for (const document of documents) {\n    const chunks = chunkDocument(document, w, s);\n\n    for (const chunk of chunks) {\n      const context = await generateContext(chunk); // Contextual summary\n      const enrichedChunk = context + chunk;\n\n      const entities = await extractEntities(enrichedChunk);\n      const relations = await extractRelations(enrichedChunk);\n\n\n        for(const e of entities) {\n            graph.addNode(e)\n        }\n\n        for(const r of relations) {\n            graph.addEdge(r.source, r.target, r.relation)\n\n        }\n    }\n  }\n\n  // Deduplicate entities\n  const nodes = graph.getNodes();\n    for (let i = 0; i < nodes.length; i++) {\n        for(let j = i + 1; j < nodes.length; j++) {\n            const node1 = nodes[i]\n            const node2 = nodes[j]\n\n            const semanticSim = cosineSimilarity(await embedText(node1), await embedText(node2))\n            const stringSim = 1 - levenshteinDistance(node1, node2)/ Math.max(node1.length, node2.length);\n\n            if(semanticSim > tSim && stringSim > tStr) {\n\n                graph.mergeNodes(node1, node2) // Implementation omitted\n            }\n\n\n        }\n    }\n\n  // Community detection (using a suitable library for Leiden algorithm is recommended)\n  const communities = leidenAlgorithm(graph);\n\n  const communitySummaries = {};\n  for (const community of communities) {\n    const paths = extractPaths(community); // Relationships paths\n    communitySummaries[community.id] = await summarizePaths(paths);  // Using LLM\n\n  }\n\n\n\n    const rankedCommunities = Object.values(communitySummaries).sort((c1, c2) => cosineSimilarity(query, c2) - cosineSimilarity(query, c1))\n\n\n    // Take top K - omitted for brevity.\n\n\n\n  // Subgraph extraction (implementation omitted for brevity.)\n\n  const paths = extractPaths(subgraph)\n  const answer = await generateAnswer(query, paths);\n\n  return answer;\n}\n\n\n// Helper functions (examples - needs actual implementation)\n\nfunction chunkDocument(document, w, s) {  return [] }\n\n\nasync function generateContext(chunk) {}\n\n\nasync function extractEntities(chunk) {}\n\n\n\nasync function extractRelations(chunk) {}\n\n\nfunction levenshteinDistance(str1, str2) {}\n\n\n\n\n\n// Etc for other helper functions.\n\n```\n\n\n**Explanation:** This algorithm constructs a knowledge graph from processed text chunks. It extracts entities and relationships within chunks using LLMs, merges duplicate entities, and performs community detection using the Leiden algorithm.  For a given query, it retrieves relevant subgraphs from the knowledge graph and uses an LLM to generate a contextually accurate answer. This structured knowledge representation enables efficient retrieval and reasoning, especially for complex, multi-hop queries.\n\n\n\nThese JavaScript implementations provide a starting point for developers. Remember to install and import necessary libraries (e.g., 'transformers.js', 'dagre', a graph library with Leiden algorithm implementation, a vector similarity library).  You'll need to adapt these implementations according to your specific needs and context.  Critically, much of the functionality relies upon well-trained LLMs to perform complex tasks such as summarization, embedding, entity recognition and relation extraction. These would need to be acquired or trained before use.",
