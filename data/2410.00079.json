  "title": "INTERACTIVE SPECULATIVE PLANNING: ENHANCE AGENT EFFICIENCY THROUGH CO-DESIGN OF SYSTEM AND USER INTERFACE",
  "abstract": "Agents, as user-centric tools, are increasingly deployed for human task delegation, assisting with a broad spectrum of requests by generating thoughts, engaging with user proxies, and producing action plans. However, agents based on large language models (LLMs) often face substantial planning latency due to two primary factors: the efficiency limitations of the underlying LLMs due to their large size and high demand, and the structural complexity of the agents due to the extensive generation of intermediate thoughts to produce the final output. Given that inefficiency in service provision can undermine the value of automation for users, this paper presents a human-centered efficient agent planning method – Interactive Speculative Planning – aiming at enhancing the efficiency of agent planning through both system design and human-AI interaction. Our approach advocates for the co-design of the agent system and user interface, underscoring the importance of an agent system that can fluidly manage user interactions and interruptions. By integrating human interruptions as a fundamental component of the system, we not only make it more user-centric but also expedite the entire process by leveraging human-in-the-loop interactions to provide accurate intermediate steps. Code and data will be released.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces \"Interactive Speculative Planning,\" a method for making LLM-based agent planning more efficient and user-friendly. It uses a faster, less accurate \"approximation agent\" to speed up the planning process of a slower, more accurate \"target agent.\" It also integrates a user interface that lets users view and interrupt the process, further improving speed and user experience.  The key point relevant to LLM-based multi-agent systems is the collaboration between multiple agents with varying capabilities to improve overall performance and user satisfaction.",
  "takeaways": "This paper offers a fresh perspective on LLM-based multi-agent systems, especially relevant for JavaScript developers aiming for real-world web app deployments. Here are some practical examples leveraging the paper's insights:\n\n**1. Building a Customer Support Chatbot with Speculative Planning**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine you're building a customer support chatbot using a JavaScript framework like React.  You want the bot to be both helpful (using a powerful, but potentially slower, LLM like GPT-4) and responsive (avoiding long delays).\n* **Applying the Paper's Insights:**\n    * **Approximation Agent (A):** Implement A using a faster LLM like GPT-3.5-turbo.  A can handle common queries, providing quick initial responses or suggesting relevant help articles.\n    * **Target Agent (T):** Use GPT-4 as T. It operates asynchronously, refining A's responses or tackling more complex issues in the background.\n    * **UI Integration (React):**  Display A's response immediately, but visually indicate that T is \"thinking.\"  Use React's state management to seamlessly update the response as T finishes, or offer the option for the user to \"See more detailed answer.\" \n\n**2. Collaborative Code Editor with Human-in-the-Loop**\n\n* **Scenario:**  You're creating a collaborative code editor (think Google Docs for code) where multiple developers can work on the same project, assisted by AI agents.\n* **Applying the Paper's Insights:**\n    * **Approximation Agent (A):** Use a code-specialized LLM like Codex (GitHub Copilot) as A to provide quick code suggestions or auto-completions as developers type.\n    * **Target Agent (T):**  Implement T with a more advanced model that understands code logic and best practices, potentially using multi-agent debate (as in the paper's Setting 3). T runs asynchronously, validating A's suggestions or offering more complex refactorings.\n    * **UI Integration (JavaScript & WebSockets):**  Utilize WebSockets for real-time collaboration. Display A's suggestions in the editor (e.g., using CodeMirror or Monaco editor). Allow developers to accept, reject, or trigger a \"deeper analysis\" from T.\n\n**3. JavaScript Libraries and Frameworks**\n\n* **LLM Integration:** `langchain.js` can help integrate both approximation (faster models) and target (slower, more capable models) agents.\n* **UI:** React's state management (useState, useReducer, or a library like Redux) is ideal for managing the asynchronous responses from A and T and updating the UI accordingly.\n* **Real-Time Communication:** Socket.IO or other WebSocket libraries are crucial for collaborative scenarios like the code editor example.\n\n**Key Takeaways for JavaScript Developers**\n\n* **Don't treat all LLM calls equally:** Identify opportunities to use faster models for initial responses, reserving more powerful LLMs for complex tasks.\n* **Embrace asynchronicity:** Design your UI and application logic with the understanding that target agent responses will likely be asynchronous.\n* **Empower users:**  Give users control, allowing them to interrupt, provide feedback, or request deeper analysis.\n* **Think about cost:**  While not explicitly covered in these examples, consider the cost implications of different LLMs. The paper's insights on efficiency can guide you in building more cost-effective systems.",

This algorithm aims to enhance the efficiency of an LLM-based agent planning system by incorporating a faster, less accurate \"approximation agent\" (A) alongside a slower, more accurate \"target agent\" (T). \n\n**Purpose:**\n\n- **Accelerated Planning:** It leverages the speed of the approximation agent to generate potential action steps quickly.\n- **Accuracy Assurance:** It verifies these steps using the target agent, ensuring the final plan is still accurate.\n- **Reduced Latency:** By running A and T concurrently and speculatively executing steps, the algorithm reduces the overall planning time, especially when A's predictions are often correct.\n\n**Key Components:**\n\n1. **`speculativePlanning(A, T, taskPrompt, k, maxApproximationSteps)`:** The main function orchestrating the speculative planning process.\n    - **`A`:** The approximation agent function.\n    - **`T`:** The target agent function.\n    - **`taskPrompt`:** The initial description or goal of the task.\n    - **`k`:** Hyperparameter controlling the maximum number of speculative steps by A.\n    - **`maxApproximationSteps`:** The maximum steps from the approximation agent.\n\n2. **Concurrent Execution:** `Promise.all()` is used to execute A and T concurrently, exploiting asynchronous JavaScript execution for potential time savings.\n\n3. **Mismatch Handling:** The code includes logic to handle cases where A's predictions are incorrect. In such situations, the target agent's results are used, and speculative steps based on the wrong prefix are discarded.\n\n4. **Termination:** The algorithm continues until a \"terminate\" action is generated, indicating the completion of the task.\n\n**Note:** The provided code is a simplified representation of the algorithm and requires the implementation of placeholder functions (`A`, `T`, `executeAction`, `updatePrompt`) based on the specific agents and tasks.",
