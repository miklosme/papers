  "title": "Learning to Negotiate via Voluntary Commitment",
  "abstract": "The partial alignment and conflict of autonomous agents lead to mixed-motive scenarios in many real-world applications. However, agents may fail to cooperate in practice even when cooperation yields a better outcome. One well-known reason for this failure comes from non-credible commitments. To facilitate commitments among agents for better cooperation, we define Markov Commitment Games (MCGs), a variant of commitment games, where agents can voluntarily commit to their proposed future plans. Based on MCGs, we propose a learnable commitment protocol via policy gradients. We further propose incentive-compatible learning to accelerate convergence to equilibria with better social welfare. Experimental results in challenging mixed-motive tasks demonstrate faster empirical convergence and higher returns for our method compared with its counterparts. Our code is available at https://github.com/shuhui-zhu/DCL.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces Markov Commitment Games (MCGs), a framework for multi-agent systems where agents can propose and commit to future actions, fostering cooperation in mixed-motive scenarios.  A learning algorithm, Differentiable Commitment Learning (DCL), enables agents to learn effective commitment strategies through policy gradients.  DCL considers joint actions and backpropagates through other agents' policies (or estimated policies in decentralized settings) for more accurate training.  Key points for LLM-based multi-agent systems include the learnable commitment mechanism without explicit reward manipulation, the potential for improved cooperation in complex environments through DCL, and the ability to generalize across tasks without pre-defined rules or centralized control (decentralized DCL).  The MCG framework, combined with DCL, offers a promising approach for building cooperative LLM-based multi-agent systems.",
  "takeaways": "This paper introduces Markov Commitment Games (MCGs) and Differentiable Commitment Learning (DCL) as a way for self-interested AI agents to learn cooperation through voluntary commitments. Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights to LLM-based multi-agent projects in web development:\n\n**1. Building Collaborative Content Creation Tools:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine a multi-agent system where LLMs collaboratively write articles or stories. Each LLM agent has its own writing style and expertise. MCGs can facilitate cooperation by allowing agents to propose text segments, commit to integrating others' contributions, and then generating subsequent text.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * **LangChain.js:**  A framework for developing applications powered by language models. It can be used to structure the interaction between LLM agents.\n    * **Message Queues (e.g., Redis, RabbitMQ):** For asynchronous communication between LLM agents during the proposal and commitment stages.\n    * **TensorFlow.js or ONNX.js:** To implement the policy networks and the DCL algorithm, handling gradient updates and policy evaluations within the browser or on a server.\n* **Example:** Agent 1 proposes an introduction, Agents 2 and 3 commit to expanding on specific points mentioned in the introduction. Agent 1 can then generate the next paragraph, considering the commitments made by Agents 2 and 3.\n\n**2. Decentralized Task Management Applications:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  An application where multiple LLM agents manage tasks, schedule meetings, or coordinate resources.  MCGs can help agents decide which tasks to take on without centralized control.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * **Web Workers:**  To manage each LLM agent as a separate process for parallel processing.\n    * **LocalForage or IndexedDB:** To store each agent's policy and DCL-related data.\n    * **Node.js with Express.js:** For server-side coordination and handling of commitment protocols.\n* **Example:**  An agent proposes to handle booking a meeting room. If other agents commit to handling related tasks like sending invitations and preparing the agenda, the first agent commits to finalizing the room booking.\n\n**3. Interactive Narrative Experiences:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Creating interactive stories or games where LLM agents represent different characters, each with their own goals and motivations. MCGs can help characters negotiate actions and storylines.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * **React.js or Vue.js:**  For building the user interface and managing the state of the narrative.\n    * **Serverless Functions (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions):** To execute LLM inferences and manage agent interactions.\n* **Example:** Character A proposes to go investigate a mysterious sound. Character B commits to following if Character A promises to share any discoveries. Character A agrees, and the narrative proceeds accordingly.\n\n**4. Personalized Recommendation Systems:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Multiple LLM agents specialize in recommending different types of products or content (movies, books, articles, etc.). MCGs can help agents coordinate their recommendations to provide a diverse and relevant experience for the user.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * **Personalized Recommendation Libraries:**  Many browser/server libraries for handling user preferences and making recommendations.\n    * **LLMs** specialized for specific product categories.\n* **Example:** Agent 1 (movies) proposes a sci-fi film. Agent 2 (books) notices the user enjoys reading fantasy and commits to recommending a related book if Agent 1 agrees to also suggest a behind-the-scenes documentary about the film. This creates a richer experience.\n\n**Key Considerations for JavaScript Developers:**\n\n* **Simplified DCL:** The full DCL algorithm might be computationally expensive for browser environments.  Consider simplifications or approximations to reduce the computational load.\n* **Decentralized Implementation:** Favor decentralized DCL whenever possible for scalability and robustness.  Libraries for peer-to-peer communication (e.g., Libp2p) can be helpful.\n* **LLM Inference Optimization:**  LLM inferences can be slow and costly.  Use techniques like caching, batching, and quantization to improve performance.\n* **User Interface Design:** The proposal and commitment stages should be integrated seamlessly into the user interface to create a natural and engaging experience.\n\n\nBy combining the insights of this research paper with available JavaScript frameworks and libraries, developers can unlock the potential of multi-agent LLM systems to build more sophisticated and engaging web applications. Remember to focus on practical scenarios and consider the computational limitations of the browser environment when implementing these complex AI concepts.",
  "pseudocode": "The provided research paper includes pseudocode blocks describing the DCL algorithms. Here are the JavaScript equivalents:\n\n**Algorithm 1: Differentiable Commitment Learning**\n\n```javascript\n// Input parameters (replace with actual values)\nconst numAgents = 2; // N\nconst numIterations = 10000; // T\nconst learningRate = 0.0004; // beta\nconst lambda = 0.1; // lambda\n\n// Initialize policy parameters (theta, zeta, eta) and action-value function (w) for each agent\n// ...\n\nfor (let k = 0; k < numIterations; k++) {\n    // 1. Collect trajectories by running current policies\n    const trajectories = collectTrajectories(policies); // Implement this function based on your environment\n\n    // 2. Compute Monte Carlo discounted accumulative rewards\n    const rewards = computeMonteCarloRewards(trajectories); // Implement this\n\n    // 3. Update value function (w) for each agent using gradient descent\n    for (let i = 0; i < numAgents; i++) {\n        w[i] = updateValueFunction(w[i], trajectories, rewards[i]); // Implement MSE loss and gradient descent\n    }\n\n    // 4.

Update policy parameters using gradient ascent\n    for (let i = 0; i < numAgents; i++) {\n        theta[i] = updatePolicy(theta[i], actionGradients[i], learningRate); // Implement gradient ascent\n        zeta[i] = updatePolicy(zeta[i], commitmentGradients[i], learningRate);\n        eta[i] = updatePolicy(eta[i], proposalGradients[i], learningRate);\n    }\n\n    // ... (Logging and other necessary operations)\n}\n\n// Helper functions to implement (collectTrajectories, computeMonteCarloRewards, updateValueFunction, \n// estimateActionGradients, estimateCommitmentGradients, estimateProposalGradients, updatePolicy)\n// ...\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThis algorithm implements the core DCL process.  It iteratively collects trajectories based on the agents' current policies, computes rewards, updates value function estimates, calculates policy gradients, and then updates the proposal, commitment, and action policies using gradient ascent.  The incentive-compatible constraint (Eq. 7) encourages agents to make beneficial proposals.\n\n**Algorithm 2: Centralized DCL**\n\nSee the JavaScript code for Algorithm 1, as Algorithm 2 is very similar. The key difference is in step 4, where Algorithm 2 calculates policy gradients using *actual* policies of other agents. This means the helper function `estimateProposalGradients` (and potentially others) would need to be adapted to use the true policies instead of estimated ones.\n\n\n**Algorithm 3: Decentralized DCL**\n\nThe JavaScript code for Algorithm 3 is quite similar to Algorithm 1, with two key changes:\n1. Each agent maintains estimates of other agentsâ€™ policies and value functions (`bib`, `Zib`, `á¿†ib`, `á¿¶ib`).\n2. Steps 3 and 4 now include estimating other agentsâ€™ policy gradients and value function updates. The key difference is that agents cannot directly access the actual policies of other agents in a decentralized setting, requiring agents to differentiate through *estimated* policies instead of actual ones.\n\n**Purpose:**\n\n* Algorithm 1 provides a general template for DCL.\n* Algorithm 2 illustrates a centralized implementation where all agent policies are accessible to every agent.\n* Algorithm 3 implements a decentralized version where agents learn by estimating other agents' policies and value functions, reflecting realistic multi-agent scenarios.\n\n\nThese JavaScript implementations serve as a starting point.  You'll need to flesh out the helper functions based on your specific multi-agent environment, state and action spaces, and the chosen policy representations (e.g., neural networks). Consider libraries like TensorFlow.js or Brain.js for neural network implementation.  You'll also need to decide on suitable gradient-based optimization algorithms (e.g., Adam).  The inclusion of the Gumbel-Softmax trick for differentiating through discrete commitments would require a custom implementation or adaptation of existing libraries.",
