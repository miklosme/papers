  "title": "LLMDR: LLM-Driven Deadlock Detection and Resolution in Multi-Agent Pathfinding",
  "abstract": "Abstract-Multi-Agent Pathfinding (MAPF) is a core challenge in multi-agent systems. Existing learning-based MAPF methods often struggle with scalability, particularly when addressing complex scenarios that are prone to deadlocks. To address these challenges, we introduce LLMDR (LLM-Driven Deadlock Detection and Resolution), an approach designed to resolve deadlocks and improve the performance of learned MAPF models. LLMDR integrates the inference capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with learned MAPF models and prioritized planning, enabling it to detect deadlocks and provide customized resolution strategies. We evaluate LLMDR on standard MAPF benchmark maps with varying agent numbers, measuring its performance when combined with several base models. The results demonstrate that LLMDR improves the performance of learned MAPF models, particularly in deadlock-prone scenarios, with notable improvements in success rates. These findings show the potential of integrating LLMs to improve the scalability of learning-based MAPF methods.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces LLMDR, a system that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to help multi-agent pathfinding systems avoid and escape deadlocks.  LLMDR works by analyzing the planned movements of agents, identifying potential deadlocks using the LLM, and then using LLM-generated strategies along with a prioritized planning algorithm (PIBT) to adjust agent actions and priorities to resolve the deadlock.  Experiments showed LLMDR improved the performance of existing multi-agent pathfinding methods, especially in complex scenarios.  Key for LLM-based multi-agent systems is the demonstration of using LLMs for high-level reasoning (deadlock detection and strategy generation) combined with a more traditional algorithm for low-level action planning, addressing some limitations of using LLMs for the entire task.",
  "takeaways": "This paper introduces LLMDR, a method for enhancing multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) in deadlock-prone scenarios using LLMs. Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights to LLM-based multi-agent AI projects, focusing on web development:\n\n**Practical Examples for JavaScript Developers:**\n\n1. **Real-time Multi-Agent Collaboration in a Browser Game:** Imagine developing a browser-based strategy game with multiple AI-controlled units.  LLMDR's principles can be applied to prevent unit congestion and deadlocks.\n\n   * **JavaScript Implementation:**  Use a library like `Phaser` or `Babylon.js` for game development.  Represent the game map as a grid. Implement the base MAPF algorithm (e.g., DHC, DCC) in JavaScript.  Integrate an LLM (via API calls to services like OpenAI or Cohere) for deadlock detection and resolution as described in the paper. The LLM receives agent positions and goals, and returns the \"leader\" or \"radiation\" strategy for each deadlock group.  Use this information to adjust agent priorities in your JavaScript MAPF implementation.\n\n   * **Deadlock Detection:**  Periodically send agent positions and goals to the LLM.  The LLM analyzes the data and identifies potential deadlocks based on movement patterns.\n\n   * **Resolution:** The LLM suggests resolution strategies (\"leader,\" \"radiation\").  Implement these strategies in JavaScript, adjusting agent priorities within the existing MAPF algorithm. For example, the \"leader\" strategy might be implemented by temporarily increasing the \"leader\" agent's priority in the pathfinding algorithm, allowing it to move first and resolve the blockage.\n\n2. **Collaborative Web Design Tools:**  Consider a collaborative web design tool where multiple AI agents assist users in arranging elements on a webpage. LLMDR can be used to coordinate the agents' actions, preventing conflicts and ensuring smooth collaboration.\n\n   * **JavaScript Framework:** Use a framework like `React` or `Vue.js` to manage the UI. Each AI agent can be represented as a component.\n\n   * **LLM Integration:** The LLM can analyze the agents' current actions (e.g., moving elements, resizing) and predict potential conflicts. It then suggests adjustments to the agents' behavior (e.g., one agent waits, another repositions the element differently) to avoid the conflict.\n\n   * **Example:** If two agents try to move the same element to overlapping positions, the LLM could assign one agent as the \"leader\" and instruct the other to \"yield,\" preventing a conflict and ensuring a consistent user experience.\n\n3. **Simulating Crowd Behavior in Web Applications:**  For applications simulating crowd behavior (e.g., for architectural design or event planning), LLMDR can help simulate more realistic movement and avoid artificial gridlocks.\n\n   * **JavaScript Library:**  Use a library like `Three.js` or `p5.js` for visualization and simulation.\n\n   * **LLM-Driven Crowd Control:**  The LLM analyzes agent movement patterns within the simulation. When it detects a potential bottleneck or jam, it can suggest adjustments to individual agent behavior (e.g., slight changes in direction, temporary speed adjustments) to improve flow and avoid gridlock.  These adjustments are implemented in JavaScript within the simulation logic.\n\n\n**Key JavaScript Concepts & Libraries:**\n\n* **LLM API Integration:** Use JavaScript `fetch` or libraries like `axios` to interact with LLM APIs.\n* **Asynchronous Programming:** Handle LLM responses asynchronously using `Promises` or `async/await`.\n* **Data Structures:** Use JavaScript arrays and objects to represent agents, their states, and the environment (e.g., game map, webpage layout).\n* **Pathfinding Libraries:**  Consider existing JavaScript pathfinding libraries as a starting point for your base MAPF implementation (e.g., `PathFinding.js`).\n\n\nBy combining the insights from the LLMDR paper with these JavaScript tools and techniques, developers can build more sophisticated and robust multi-agent AI systems for web applications. Remember to focus on modular design and clear separation of concerns between the base MAPF logic, the LLM integration, and the UI components. This will make your code more maintainable and scalable.",
  "pseudocode": "The paper contains two pseudocode blocks. Here are their JavaScript equivalents along with explanations:\n\n**Algorithm 1: Priority Inheritance with Backtracking (PIBT)**\n\n```javascript\nfunction pibt(currentStates, agentPriorities, staticObstacles) {\n  const reserved = new Set(); // Use a Set for efficient checking\n  const moves = {}; // Stores the chosen move for each agent\n\n  for (const k of agentPriorities.keys().sort((a, b) => agentPriorities.get(a) - agentPriorities.get(b))) { // Sort agent priorities\n    if (!(k in moves)) {\n      if (pibt_h(k, currentStates, reserved, moves, staticObstacles)) { \n        return moves; // Return moves if a solution is found\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  return null; // No solution found (can return empty object or other indicator if preferred)\n\n  function pibt_h(agent, currentStates, reserved, moves, staticObstacles) {\n    const possibleActions = getPossibleActions(agent, currentStates); // Placeholder for getting possible actions\n\n    for (const action of possibleActions) { \n      const nextState = transition(currentStates[agent], action); // Placeholder for state transition function\n\n      const reservedLocation = nextState.x * 100 + nextState.y; // Example of generating unique reserved location\n      const reservedMove = currentStates[agent].x * 100 + currentStates[agent].y + \"_\" + nextState.x * 100 + nextState.y;\n      if (collides(nextState, staticObstacles) || reserved.has(reservedLocation) || reserved.has(reservedMove)) {\n        continue;\n      }\n\n      moves[agent] = action;\n      reserved.add(reservedLocation);\n      reserved.add(reservedMove);\n\n\n      for (let j = 0; j < currentStates.length; j++) {\n        if (j !== agent && currentStates[j].x === nextState.x && currentStates[j].y === nextState.y) {\n          if (!pibt_h(j, currentStates, reserved, moves, staticObstacles)) {\n            moves[agent] = null;\n            reserved.delete(reservedLocation);\n            reserved.delete(reservedMove);\n          } else{\n             return true; // Successfully found move\n          }\n          break;// already checked collision, dont need to check other agent\n        }\n      }\n\n      return true; // Successfully found move\n    }\n\n    return false;\n  }\n\n\n\n  function collides(state, obstacles) {\n    return obstacles.some(obstacle => state.x === obstacle.x && state.y === obstacle.y);\n  }\n\n  function transition(currentState, action) {\n    // This function should implement the transition logic based on the action\n    // This is a placeholder, replace with actual implementation. Assume actions are directions.\n    const nextState = { ...currentState };\n    switch (action) {\n      case \"up\": nextState.y++; break;\n      case \"down\": nextState.y--; break;\n      case \"left\": nextState.x--; break;\n      case \"right\": nextState.x++; break;\n      case \"stay\": break; // No change to position for \"stay\"\n    }\n    return nextState;\n  }\n\n  function getPossibleActions(agent, currentStates){\n    // Placeholder - implement action selection here.  Includes \"stay\" action.\n    return [\"up\", \"down\", \"left\", \"right\", \"stay\"];\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n```\n\n* **Purpose:** This algorithm finds collision-free paths for multiple agents in a grid environment, taking agent priorities into account. Higher-priority agents get to choose their actions first. \n* **Explanation:**  PIBT extends prioritized planning by allowing lower-priority agents to \"inherit\" the priority of a higher-priority agent if they are blocking its path. It also uses backtracking to explore alternative paths if an agent gets stuck.\n* **Key improvements:**\n    * Use of `Set` for `reserved` provides efficient checking of reserved locations and moves.\n    * Explicitly handles the \"stay\" action for clearer logic.\n    * Placeholder functions (`getPossibleActions`, `transition`) are included to highlight areas where custom implementation is needed.\n    * Uses unique representation of reserved locations to prevent collisions.\n    * Uses the `sort` method with a custom comparison function for better readability and control over priority sorting.\n    * Returns `null` explicitly when no solution is found, providing a cleaner exit condition.\n\n\n**Algorithm 2: Strategized PIBT for Deadlock Resolution**\n\n```javascript\nfunction strategizedPibt(currentStates, actions, strategy, staticObstacles) {\n  const agentPriorities = {};\n  const actionsSorted = {};\n\n  for (const k in currentStates) { // Iterate over agent IDs\n    agentPriorities[k] = strategy.priorityForAgent(k);\n    actionsSorted[k] = actions[k].sort((a, b) => strategy.actionPriorityForAgent(k, a) - strategy.actionPriorityForAgent(k, b));\n  }\n\n  return pibt(currentStates, agentPriorities, staticObstacles);\n}\n```\n\n* **Purpose:** This function integrates an LLM-generated `strategy` into the PIBT algorithm.\n* **Explanation:**  The LLM provides two functions: `priorityForAgent(k)` which returns the priority of agent `k`, and `actionPriorityForAgent(k, a)` which returns the priority of action `a` for agent `k`. These priorities are then used to sort the agents and their actions before passing them to the `pibt` function. This allows the LLM to guide the deadlock resolution process.\n\nThis conversion uses JavaScript's object and array structures to represent the data used in the algorithms. The placeholder functions in Algorithm 1 are there to indicate areas requiring specific implementations based on the environment and agent capabilities.  The comments clarify specific choices and improve overall readability.  The revised code now clarifies how to handle actions like \"stay\" and how states transition in the search space.",
