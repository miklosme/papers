  "title": "Urban Air Mobility as a System of Systems: An LLM-Enhanced Holonic Approach",
  "abstract": "Abstract-Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is an emerging System of System (SoS) that faces challenges in system architecture, planning, task management, and execution. Traditional architectural approaches struggle with scalability, adaptability, and seamless resource integration within dynamic and complex environments. This paper presents an intelligent holonic architecture that incorporates Large Language Model (LLM) to manage the complexities of UAM. Holons function semi-autonomously, allowing for real-time coordination among air taxis, ground transport, and vertiports. LLMs process natural language inputs, generate adaptive plans, and manage disruptions such as weather changes or airspace closures. Through a case study of multimodal transportation with electric scooters and air taxis, we demonstrate how this architecture enables dynamic resource allocation, real-time replanning, and autonomous adaptation without centralized control, creating more resilient and efficient urban transportation networks. By advancing decentralized control and AI-driven adaptability, this work lays the groundwork for resilient, human-centric UAM ecosystems, with future efforts targeting hybrid AI integration and real-world validation.",
  "summary": "This paper proposes a new system architecture for managing Urban Air Mobility (UAM), a complex network of air taxis, ground vehicles, and infrastructure.  It uses a \"holonic\" approach, meaning the system is made up of independent but cooperating parts (holons), like a swarm.  Crucially, these holons leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret commands, make plans, and adapt to real-time changes like traffic or weather, demonstrating the potential of LLM-driven reasoning in a complex, multi-agent environment. This enhances the system's flexibility and resilience compared to traditional methods.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents a compelling vision for applying LLMs to multi-agent systems in UAM, and its core concepts translate well to other web development domains.  Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights to LLM-based multi-agent projects, focusing on web development scenarios:\n\n**1. Holonic Architecture with JavaScript:**\n\n* **Concept:**  Decentralized, hierarchical structure with semi-autonomous agents (holons) that can operate independently and as part of a larger whole.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * **Agent Framework:**  Develop a custom agent class or leverage libraries like `Agent.js` or create a simple system with interacting objects and functions.\n    * **Communication:** Utilize WebSockets or server-sent events (SSE) for real-time communication between agents. Consider message brokers like Redis or RabbitMQ for more robust messaging.\n    * **Hierarchy:** Represent the holarchy using nested JavaScript objects or a graph database (e.g., Neo4j, implemented in JavaScript using the `neo4j-driver` library).  Parent holons can issue commands and receive status updates from children.\n* **Web Scenario:** An e-commerce platform with multiple agent types: product recommendation agents, inventory management agents, customer service agents, and a supervisor agent coordinating overall strategy.\n\n**2. LLM-Driven Reasoning:**\n\n* **Concept:**  LLMs parse natural language instructions, generate plans, and adapt to changing conditions.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * **LLM Integration:** Integrate with cloud-based LLM APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Cohere, or other providers offering embeddings and text generation capabilities).\n    * **Prompt Engineering:** Carefully craft prompts to elicit desired behavior from the LLM.  For example, \"Given current inventory levels and predicted demand, generate a restocking plan for product X.\"\n    * **Plan Interpretation:** Parse the LLM's output (likely JSON or a structured text format) into actionable instructions for the agents.\n* **Web Scenario:**  A collaborative writing tool where an LLM agent suggests edits, rephrases sentences, and ensures consistency based on user input and context.\n\n**3. Dynamic Replanning:**\n\n* **Concept:**  Agents adapt their plans based on real-time data and LLM-driven reasoning.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * **Event Handling:** Use JavaScript event listeners to respond to changes in the environment (e.g., new user data, updated inventory levels).\n    * **LLM-Based Adaptation:**  When a significant change occurs, query the LLM with a prompt describing the new situation and request an updated plan.\n* **Web Scenario:** A ride-sharing app where route planning agents dynamically adjust routes based on traffic conditions, accidents reported by user agents, or changes in destination requested by rider agents.\n\n**4. Multimodal Interaction:**\n\n* **Concept:**  Agents handle different data types and communication channels.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:**\n    * **Data Parsing:** Use JavaScript libraries to process different data formats (e.g., JSON for structured data, Web Audio API for audio input).\n    * **Modal Switching:** Design agents that can seamlessly switch between different communication modalities (e.g., text chat, voice commands).\n* **Web Scenario:** A smart home system with agents controlling lights, temperature, and security.  Users can interact using voice commands, a web interface, or mobile app, and agents coordinate actions accordingly.\n\n**5. JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries:**\n\n* **Frontend Frameworks:** React, Vue, or Angular for building user interfaces for interacting with the multi-agent system.\n* **Node.js:** For building backend services and managing agent communication.\n* **TensorFlow.js or WebDNN:** If running smaller LLMs client-side, enabling on-device inference.\n* **D3.js or other visualization libraries:** For visualizing the agent interactions and system status.\n\n**Example Code Snippet (Conceptual):**\n\n```javascript\n// Example of a simple agent with LLM integration (using a placeholder API)\nclass Agent {\n  constructor(role, llmAPI) {\n    this.role = role;\n    this.llmAPI = llmAPI;\n  }\n\n  async generatePlan(goal) {\n    const prompt = `Generate a plan for ${this.role} to achieve: ${goal}`;\n    const response = await this.llmAPI.generateText(prompt);\n    // Parse response and return an actionable plan (simplified)\n    return JSON.parse(response);\n  }\n\n  executePlan(plan) {\n    // Execute the plan (implementation-specific)\n    console.log(`${this.role} executing plan:`, plan);\n  }\n}\n\n\n// Example usage\nconst inventoryAgent = new Agent(\"inventory management\", myLLMAPI);\ninventoryAgent.generatePlan(\"Restock low inventory items\").then(plan => {\n  inventoryAgent.executePlan(plan);\n});\n\n```\n\nBy combining the holonic architecture with the reasoning power of LLMs, JavaScript developers can create sophisticated, adaptable, and user-friendly web applications that leverage the potential of multi-agent AI. Remember that this is a simplified illustration. Real-world implementations would require significantly more complex logic for communication, plan parsing, error handling, and integration with specific LLM APIs. However, this provides a starting point for thinking about how to structure such a system in JavaScript.",
