  "title": "DroidSpeak: Enhancing cross-LLM communication",
  "abstract": "In multi-agent systems utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs), communication between agents traditionally relies on natural language. This communication often includes the full context of the query so far, which can introduce significant prefill-phase latency, especially with long contexts. We introduce DroidSpeak, a novel framework to target this cross-LLM communication by leveraging the reuse of intermediate data, such as input embeddings (E-cache) and key-value caches (KV-cache). We efficiently bypass the need to reprocess entire contexts for fine-tuned versions of the same foundational model. This approach allows faster context integration while maintaining the quality of task performance. Experimental evaluations demonstrate DroidSpeak’s ability to significantly accelerate inter-agent communication, achieving up to a 2.78× speedup in prefill latency with negligible loss in accuracy. Our findings underscore the potential to create more efficient and scalable multi-agent systems.",
  "summary": "DroidSpeak enhances communication speed between large language model (LLM) agents, particularly fine-tuned versions of the same base model.  It leverages the similarities in these models by selectively reusing intermediate computation results (embedding and key-value caches) from the sender LLM, reducing redundant processing on the receiver's end and significantly speeding up interactions without substantial accuracy loss. This addresses the bottleneck of prefill latency, which dominates communication time in multi-agent LLM systems.",
  "takeaways": "This paper introduces DroidSpeak, a method for optimizing communication between LLM agents in multi-agent systems, particularly relevant when agents are fine-tuned versions of the same base LLM. Here are practical examples of how JavaScript developers can apply these insights in web development:\n\n**1. Collaborative Web Design Agent:**\n\nImagine building a multi-agent system where one agent generates website mockups (using a base LLM like Llama-2) and another agent refines the design based on user feedback (a fine-tuned version of the same LLM).\n\n* **Current Approach (Natural Language):** The mockup-generating agent would send the entire mockup code (HTML, CSS) as text to the refining agent. The refining agent would re-parse this, leading to significant prefill overhead.\n* **DroidSpeak Approach:**  Instead of sending raw code as text, the mockup agent could send its intermediate representations (E-cache, potentially KV-cache depending on the framework used). The refining agent can directly utilize this, bypassing the expensive prefill phase.\n\n**JavaScript Implementation (Conceptual):**\n\n```javascript\n// Mockup Agent\nconst mockupLLM = new LLMAgent(\"base-llama-2\");\nconst mockup = mockupLLM.generateMockup(userInput);\nconst eCache = mockupLLM.getECache(); // Get intermediate representation\n\n// Send eCache to refining agent (using WebSockets or similar)\nsendMessageToRefiningAgent({ type: \"eCache\", data: eCache });\n\n\n// Refining Agent\nconst refiningLLM = new LLMAgent(\"fine-tuned-llama-2\");\n\nonMessageFromMockupAgent((message) => {\n  if (message.type === \"eCache\") {\n    refiningLLM.setECache(message.data); // Set received E-cache\n    const refinedMockup = refiningLLM.refineMockup(userFeedback);\n    // ... further processing ...\n  }\n});\n```\n\n**Relevant Libraries:**  LangChain.js could be extended to support this kind of intermediate data exchange.  WebSockets or server-sent events would facilitate real-time communication between agents.\n\n\n**2. Multi-Agent Chat Application:**\n\nConsider a customer support application with multiple specialized agents (order status, technical support, billing).  Each agent could be a fine-tuned LLM specializing in its domain.\n\n* **Current Approach:**  Each agent receives the entire conversation history as text, leading to repeated prefill overhead.\n* **DroidSpeak Approach:** Agents can exchange intermediate data. When transferring a conversation to a billing agent, the previous agent can send its E-cache, reducing the billing agent's prefill time significantly.\n\n\n**3. Real-time Collaborative Code Editor:**\n\nMultiple developers could work on a codebase simultaneously with LLM agents assisting them. DroidSpeak could optimize communication between these agents, reducing latency for code suggestions, error detection, and auto-completion.\n\n\n**Key Considerations for JavaScript Developers:**\n\n* **Framework Integration:** How to integrate DroidSpeak-like functionality into existing LLM frameworks like LangChain.js or Transformers.js.\n* **Data Serialization:** Efficiently serializing and transmitting large E-cache and KV-cache data between agents (e.g., using Protobuf or similar binary formats).\n* **Security:** Ensuring secure transfer and handling of sensitive intermediate data.\n* **Experimentation:**  Start by experimenting with smaller models and datasets to test the feasibility and performance gains of this approach. Gradually scale up to larger models and more complex web applications.\n\nBy understanding the principles of DroidSpeak and applying them creatively, JavaScript developers can significantly improve the performance and responsiveness of LLM-based multi-agent applications in diverse web development scenarios. This opens up exciting possibilities for building more sophisticated and interactive user experiences.",
