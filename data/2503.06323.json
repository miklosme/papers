  "title": "Higher-Order Belief in Incomplete Information MAIDs",
  "abstract": "Multi-agent influence diagrams (MAIDs) are probabilistic graphical models which represent strategic interactions between agents. MAIDs are equivalent to extensive form games (EFGs) but have a more compact and informative structure. However, MAIDs cannot, in general, represent settings of incomplete information - wherein agents have different beliefs about the game being played, and different beliefs about each-other's beliefs. In this paper, we introduce incomplete information MAIDs (II-MAIDs). We define both infinite and finite-depth II-MAIDs and prove an equivalence relation to EFGs with incomplete information and no common prior over types. We prove that II-MAIDs inherit classical equilibria concepts via this equivalence, but note that these solution concepts are often unrealistic in the setting with no common prior because they violate common knowledge of rationality. We define a more realistic solution concept based on recursive best-response. Throughout, we describe an example with a hypothetical AI agent undergoing evaluation to illustrate the applicability of II-MAIDs.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces *Incomplete Information Multi-Agent Influence Diagrams (II-MAIDs)*, a new way to model multi-agent interactions where agents have different, potentially inaccurate, beliefs about the game and each other's beliefs.  It shows that II-MAIDs are equivalent to a type of *Extensive Form Game (EFG)*. While traditional game theory solutions like *Nash Equilibria* exist in II-MAIDs, they don't always reflect realistic agent behavior because they can violate common knowledge of rationality. To address this, the paper introduces a simplified *finite-depth II-MAID* with a *recursive best-response* solution that produces more realistic outcomes.\n\nFor LLM-based multi-agent systems, II-MAIDs provide a framework to:\n\n* Model agents with differing or incorrect beliefs about the nature of their interaction.\n* Analyze scenarios where LLMs might have mismatched or evolving understandings of a shared task.\n* Develop more realistic behavior models for LLM agents by incorporating higher-order beliefs and reasoning about those beliefs.\n* Explore solution concepts beyond traditional game theory by considering the depth of LLM reasoning and recursive best response dynamics.",
  "takeaways": "This paper introduces Incomplete Information MAIDs (II-MAIDs), a framework for modeling multi-agent systems where agents have different, potentially inaccurate, beliefs about the game structure and each other's beliefs. Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights to LLM-based multi-agent web applications:\n\n**1. Modeling Complex Interactions:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine building a collaborative writing web app with multiple LLM-powered agents.  Each agent has a different writing style and preferences (e.g., formal, informal, concise, descriptive).  They might also have different understandings of the overall writing goal (e.g., persuasive essay, technical documentation).\n* **Application:** Use II-MAIDs to model this scenario. Each agent's subjective MAID represents its beliefs about the writing goal, its own preferences, and its beliefs about the other agents' styles and preferences. The objective MAID represents the actual overall goal. The differences between subjective and objective MAIDs reflect incomplete information.  You could represent this in JavaScript using objects for each agent's subjective MAID and a separate object for the objective MAID.\n* **JavaScript Example (Simplified):**\n\n```javascript\nconst objectiveMAID = { goal: \"persuasive essay\", styleGuide: \"formal\" };\n\nconst agent1MAID = { \n  goal: \"informative article\",  // Agent 1 misunderstands\n  style: \"informal\", \n  beliefsAboutAgent2: { style: \"formal\" } // Incorrect belief\n};\n\nconst agent2MAID = { \n  goal: \"persuasive essay\", \n  style: \"formal\",\n  beliefsAboutAgent1: { style: \"informal\" } // Correct belief\n};\n// ... and so on for other agents.\n```\n\n**2. Recursive Best Response for LLM Agents:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  In the writing app, agents need to decide on the next sentence to write.  Given incomplete information, simple best response strategies (assuming all agents share correct beliefs) won't work well.\n* **Application:**  Implement the recursive best response algorithm described in the paper. Each agent reasons about what it believes the other agents will do, given their (potentially incorrect) beliefs. This allows the agents to act rationally even with incomplete information. This can be implemented as a recursive function in JavaScript.\n* **JavaScript Example (Conceptual):**\n\n```javascript\nfunction recursiveBestResponse(agent, currentMAID, depth) {\n  if (depth === 0) { // Base case: depth-0 subjective MAID\n    return agent.chooseBestAction(currentMAID);\n  } else {\n    // Reason about other agents' actions based on beliefs\n    const otherAgentActions = agent.predictOtherAgentActions(currentMAID);\n    // ... (recursively call recursiveBestResponse with reduced depth)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**3. Simulating and Visualizing II-MAIDs:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  You want to understand how different initial belief distributions affect the agents' behavior and the overall outcome of the writing task.\n* **Application:**  Develop a JavaScript-based simulator to visualize the II-MAID structure and run simulations.  Libraries like `vis.js` or `D3.js` could be used to visualize the graph structure of the MAIDs and the evolving beliefs over time.\n\n**4. Integration with LLM APIs:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Connect the agents to LLM APIs like OpenAI or Cohere. The agents' policies, derived from the recursive best response algorithm, would determine the prompts sent to the LLM.  The LLM responses would then be incorporated into the simulation.\n* **Application:** Use a JavaScript framework like `Node.js` to manage the interaction between the simulation and the LLM API.\n\n\n**5. Practical Considerations:**\n\n* **Simplified Beliefs:** In practice, representing the full belief hierarchy might be computationally intractable. Consider using simplified representations of beliefs or approximations of the recursive best response algorithm.\n* **Finite Depth:** Use a finite depth for belief hierarchies, as described in the paper, to make computation feasible.\n* **Agent Communication:**  Introduce explicit communication mechanisms into the II-MAID model. Agents could exchange messages to update their beliefs about each other, leading to more effective collaboration.\n\n\nBy combining the theoretical framework of II-MAIDs with practical JavaScript implementation and LLM integration, developers can build more robust and intelligent multi-agent web applications that effectively handle scenarios with incomplete information and inconsistent beliefs. This will lead to advancements in areas like collaborative writing, interactive storytelling, and online gaming.",
  "pseudocode": "The paper contains several algorithm descriptions presented as definitions, but not in a traditional pseudocode block format. Therefore, converting them directly to JavaScript while retaining the mathematical rigor would be challenging and might misrepresent the original intent. However, I can provide JavaScript-style implementations of the core concepts, inspired by the definitions, to illustrate their application in a web development context.\n\n**1. Policy Evaluation in a MAID (Simplified):**\n\n```javascript\nfunction evaluatePolicy(maid, policy) {\n  // Simplified example: Assumes discrete variables and known CPDs.\n  let expectedUtility = 0;\n  for (const outcome of maid.getAllOutcomes()) { // Iterate through all possible outcomes\n    let probability = 1;\n    for (const variable in outcome) {\n      if (variable in policy) { // Decision variable\n        probability *= policy[variable](outcome[variable], outcome); // Policy provides probability given context\n      } else { // Chance variable\n        probability *= maid.getCPD(variable)(outcome[variable], outcome); // CPD from MAID\n      }\n    }\n    expectedUtility += probability * maid.getUtility(outcome); // Utility function from MAID\n  }\n  return expectedUtility;\n}\n\n\n//Example Usage (Refer to Example 1 in the paper)\nconst maid = {\n    //Implementation of CPDs, Utilities, and other MAID specifics\n    getCPD: (variable) => {/*Returns a function to calculate the CPD*/},\n    getUtility: (outcome) => {/*Returns the utility for given outcome*/},\n    getAllOutcomes: () => {/*Returns an array of all possible outcomes*/}\n}\n\nconst policy = {\n    //Example policy implementation for agent A\n    DA: (decision, outcome) => {/*Returns probability of decision given the outcome*/},\n    //Other policies\n}\n\nconst expectedUtility = evaluatePolicy(maid, policy);\nconsole.log(\"Expected Utility:\", expectedUtility);\n\n\n```\n**Explanation:** This function calculates the expected utility of a given `policy` within a simplified `maid` representation.  It iterates through all possible outcomes, calculates the probability of each outcome given the policy and the MAID's CPDs, and sums the utility weighted by the probability. This is a core concept for agent decision-making in a MAID setting.  Note:  A full implementation would require handling continuous variables, complex dependencies, and potentially integrating with an external Bayesian network library.\n\n**2. Best Response (Simplified):**\n\n```javascript\nfunction bestResponse(maid, opponentPolicy) {\n  // Simplified example: Assumes discrete actions and brute-force search.\n  let bestAction = null;\n  let maxExpectedUtility = -Infinity;\n  for (const action of maid.getAvailableActions()) { // Iterate through all actions for the agent.\n    const policy = { ...opponentPolicy, DA: () => action}; //Combine opponent policies and agent action as a complete policy\n    const expectedUtility = evaluatePolicy(maid, policy);\n    if (expectedUtility > maxExpectedUtility) {\n      maxExpectedUtility = expectedUtility;\n      bestAction = action;\n    }\n  }\n\n  return bestAction; \n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:** This function calculates a best response action for an agent, given a `maid` and `opponentPolicy`. It does a simplified search over all available actions for the agent, evaluates the expected utility of each action in response to the given opponent policy, and returns the action maximizing the agent's utility.\nNote: A real-world implementation would often involve more sophisticated optimization techniques (like gradient ascent) rather than brute-force search and handle mixed-strategy scenarios (returning probability distributions over actions).\n\n**3. Recursive Best Response (Conceptual):**\n\nJavaScript doesn't natively support recursive data structures with infinite depth, as represented by the II-MAID in the paper.  However, the core concept can be illustrated with a limited-depth structure and the assumption that we are operating within a depth-k II-MAID where k is known:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction recursiveBestResponse(iiMaid, depth, agent) {\n  if (depth === 0) {\n    // Base case: Depth-0 subjective MAID, single agent decision problem\n    // (Implementation would be similar to bestResponse, maximizing expected utility directly).\n    return bestResponseForDepthZero(iiMaid, agent);\n  } else {\n    const updated_iiMaid = {...iiMaid}\n    for(const otherAgent of iiMaid.agents){\n        if(otherAgent != agent){\n            const sub_iiMaid = iiMaid.getBeliefs(agent, otherAgent) // Access agent's beliefs about other agents\n            updated_iiMaid.setPolicy(agent, otherAgent, recursiveBestResponse(sub_iiMaid, depth - 1, otherAgent))\n        }\n    }\n    return bestResponse(updated_iiMaid.getMaid(agent), updated_iiMaid.getPolicies(agent));\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:** This recursive function conceptually illustrates the process of iterating through beliefs about other agents' beliefs. At each depth, we calculate best responses by assuming best response behavior at lower depths. This captures the core idea of recursive best response. Note: A complete, real-world implementation would require a sophisticated representation of the II-MAID structure, including the subjective MAIDs and agents' beliefs.\n\nThese JavaScript examples provide a starting point for software engineers looking to explore the concepts presented in the research paper.  They illustrate key algorithms and can be further developed into more robust implementations within a JavaScript development environment.  Remember that the core challenge of implementing multi-agent AI systems in the web lies in representing and managing the complex belief hierarchies and subjective models, potentially using techniques like serialization and a dedicated belief representation library/framework.",
