  "abstract": "The vast majority of Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) methods with completeness guarantees require planning full horizon paths. However, planning full horizon paths can take too long and be impractical in real-world applications. Instead, real-time planning and execution, which only allows the planner a finite amount of time before executing and replanning, is more practical for real-world multi-agent systems. Several methods utilize real-time planning schemes but none are provably complete, which leads to livelock or deadlock. Our main contribution is to show the first Real-Time MAPF method with provable completeness guarantees. We do this by leveraging LaCAM (Okumura 2023) in an incremental fashion. Our results show how we can iteratively plan for congested environments with a cutoff time of milliseconds while still maintaining the same success rate as full horizon LaCAM. We also show how it can be used with a single-step learned MAPF policy. The proposed Real-Time LaCAM also provides us with a general mechanism for using iterative constraints for completeness in future real-time MAPF algorithms.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces Real-Time LaCAM, a complete algorithm for Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) that operates under real-time constraints.  It incrementally builds a search tree, reusing previous computations and adding constraints to avoid deadlock/livelock, making it suitable for applications like warehouse robotics where planning time is limited.\n\nFor LLM-based multi-agent systems, Real-Time LaCAM offers a robust framework for coordinating agent actions in dynamic environments.  Its compatibility with learned policies, demonstrated through integration with collision-shield PIBT and models like SSIL, highlights its potential for blending traditional search with learned behaviors in real-time multi-agent scenarios. The constraint-based approach can be viewed as a general mechanism applicable to other windowed MAPF planners and potentially other multi-agent coordination tasks involving LLMs.",
  "takeaways": "This paper introduces Real-Time LaCAM, a complete algorithm for Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) suitable for real-time applications. Here's how a JavaScript developer can apply these insights to LLM-based multi-agent AI projects in web development:\n\n**1. Real-time Collaborative Editing:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine a collaborative document editing platform like Google Docs, but with AI agents assisting users. Multiple agents could suggest edits, reformat text, or even generate content snippets, all operating concurrently.\n* **Application:** Real-Time LaCAM can manage the \"paths\" of these agents' actions, ensuring they don't conflict. For example, two agents shouldn't attempt to edit the same sentence simultaneously.  Each agent's action can be considered a \"move\" in the MAPF configuration space.\n* **Implementation:**  A JavaScript implementation might use a library like `yjs` (for shared data structures) combined with a custom implementation of Real-Time LaCAM. The LaCAM algorithm would decide which agent gets to execute its action next based on the constraint satisfaction principles described in the paper.\n\n**2. Multi-Agent Chatbots for Customer Service:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  A website employs multiple specialized chatbots. One handles shipping inquiries, another deals with returns, and a third specializes in product information. They need to collaborate seamlessly to answer complex customer questions.\n* **Application:**  When a customer asks a question that requires input from multiple bots, Real-Time LaCAM can coordinate their responses. It ensures each bot contributes its relevant information without interrupting or duplicating each other. The \"path\" in this case represents the sequence of messages each bot contributes to the overall conversation.\n* **Implementation:**  A Node.js backend with a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ) could manage communication between bots. A Real-Time LaCAM implementation would determine the order in which bots respond, based on the constraints of the conversation flow and the customer's needs.\n\n**3. AI-Driven Game Development:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  A browser-based strategy game involves multiple AI-controlled factions interacting on a dynamic map.  Each faction needs to plan its moves, manage resources, and engage in combat with other factions in real-time.\n* **Application:** Real-Time LaCAM can manage the pathfinding and action planning of each faction, ensuring they don't collide or interfere with each other's actions.  The game map is the MAPF grid, and each unit's movement is a \"step.\"\n* **Implementation:**  A JavaScript game engine like Phaser or Babylon.js can be used for rendering and game logic. A custom implementation of Real-Time LaCAM would manage the AI factions' actions within the game engine's update loop.\n\n**4. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) on the Web:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  A DAO manages resources and makes decisions through smart contracts. Multiple agents (representing DAO members or automated processes) propose actions and vote on proposals.\n* **Application:** Real-Time LaCAM can be used to coordinate these actions, ensuring that they don't conflict and that the DAO operates efficiently. Each action proposed by an agent constitutes a \"move\" in the DAO's state space.\n* **Implementation:**  Web3 libraries like `ethers.js` or `web3.js` can interact with smart contracts.  A Real-Time LaCAM implementation would determine the order in which actions are processed and voted on, based on constraints defined in the DAO's governance rules.\n\n**Key JavaScript Considerations:**\n\n* **Asynchronous Programming:** Real-time applications heavily rely on asynchronous operations. Promises, async/await, and Web Workers are crucial for preventing blocking operations during planning and execution.\n* **Data Structures:** Efficient data structures are essential for representing the MAPF grid, agent states, and the LaCAM search tree. Libraries like Immutable.js can be helpful for managing complex state updates.\n* **Visualization:**  Visualizing the agents' paths and the MAPF grid can be beneficial for debugging and understanding the system's behavior. Libraries like D3.js or Chart.js can be used for creating visualizations.\n\nBy combining the insights from the Real-Time LaCAM paper with existing JavaScript tools and frameworks, developers can create innovative and efficient LLM-based multi-agent web applications. Remember to adapt the core concepts to your specific scenario and prioritize efficient implementation for real-time performance.",
  "pseudocode": "No pseudocode block found. Although the paper describes the Real-Time LaCAM algorithm in detail, it does so using prose and diagrams (Figure 1), rather than formal pseudocode.  The core logic revolves around iteratively building a Depth-First Search tree, rerooting it after each agent movement, and using constraints to ensure completeness. While a formal pseudocode representation would be beneficial for direct translation to JavaScript, the descriptive explanation provides sufficient information for a JavaScript developer to implement the algorithm.",
