  "title": "Cross-environment Cooperation Enables Zero-shot Multi-agent Coordination",
  "abstract": "Zero-shot coordination (ZSC), the ability to adapt to a new partner in a cooperative task, is a critical component of human-compatible AI. While prior work has focused on training agents to cooperate on a single task, these specialized models do not generalize to new tasks, even if they are highly similar. Here, we study how reinforcement learning on a distribution of environments with a single partner enables learning general cooperative skills that support ZSC with many new partners on many new problems. We introduce two Jax-based, procedural generators that create billions of solvable coordination challenges. We develop a new paradigm called Cross-Environment Cooperation (CEC), and show that it outperforms competitive baselines quantitatively and qualitatively when collaborating with real people. Our findings suggest that learning to collaborate across many unique scenarios encourages agents to develop general norms, which prove effective for collaboration with different partners. Together, our results suggest a new route toward designing generalist cooperative agents capable of interacting with humans without requiring human data. Code for environment, training, and testing scripts and more can be found at https://kjha02.github.io/publication/cross-env-coop.",
  "summary": "This paper explores how to train AI agents that can effectively cooperate with new partners in unfamiliar environments, a concept called Zero-Shot Coordination (ZSC).  It introduces Cross-Environment Cooperation (CEC), where agents train via self-play across diverse, procedurally generated environments, rather than with diverse partners in a single environment (as in Population-Based Training or PBT).  \n\nKey points for LLM-based multi-agent systems:  CEC promotes learning general cooperative \"norms\" instead of overfitting to specific partners or environments.  This is achieved by exposing the agent to many variations of a task, encouraging a broader understanding of its structure.  The results suggest that CEC agents exhibit better generalization to new tasks and partners (including humans), even outperforming specialized models in human-AI collaboration evaluations.  The method leverages the power of procedurally generated environments for scalable and efficient training, crucial for large language models. The procedural generation approach showcased can be directly applied to LLM-based scenarios to evaluate and enhance cooperative skills in simulated environments before real-world deployment.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents exciting opportunities for JavaScript developers working with LLM-based multi-agent systems. The core idea of Cross-Environment Cooperation (CEC) translates beautifully to the web development context.  Here are some practical examples of how a JavaScript developer can leverage these insights:\n\n**1. Building Collaborative LLM-powered Chatbots:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine developing a customer service system with multiple LLM-powered chatbots specializing in different areas (e.g., order tracking, technical support, returns).  These bots need to seamlessly collaborate to resolve complex customer issues.\n* **CEC Application:** Instead of training each bot individually on a limited set of scenarios with simulated partners (PBT), you can use CEC. Create a diverse set of simulated customer journeys, representing various issues and complexities. Train all the bots together on this diverse dataset, encouraging them to learn general collaboration norms.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** Use a JavaScript framework like LangChain or a library like Transformers.js to interact with your LLMs.  Structure your training environment using Node.js and a library like Jest for testing.  The diverse customer journeys can be generated programmatically and stored in a JSON format.  Each chatbot can be implemented as a separate module interacting with a shared environment.\n\n**2. Developing Interactive Narrative Experiences:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Create an interactive story where users influence the plot by interacting with multiple LLM-powered characters. The characters need to react realistically to user input and maintain narrative consistency through their interactions.\n* **CEC Application:**  Train the LLM characters using CEC on a range of procedurally generated story snippets and user interaction scenarios. This fosters a shared understanding of the narrative world, character motivations, and interaction styles.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** Use a front-end framework like React or Vue.js to build the user interface.  Implement the LLM characters using a library like LangChain and store the narrative context using a state management library like Redux or Vuex.  Procedural story generation can be achieved using a combination of JavaScript templating libraries and random data generation.\n\n**3. Creating Multi-agent Web Games:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Develop a web-based strategy game where players control teams of LLM-powered units. The units need to coordinate their actions effectively to achieve shared goals.\n* **CEC Application:**  Train the LLM agents using CEC on procedurally generated game maps and scenarios with varied objectives and unit compositions.  This allows them to learn generalizable coordination strategies, adapting to novel teammates and game situations.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** Use a JavaScript game engine like Phaser or Babylon.js. Implement the LLM agents using a library like LangChain and manage game state using a framework like Colyseus. Procedurally generate game maps and scenarios using JavaScript and store them as JSON data.\n\n**4.  Collaborative Content Creation Tools:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Build a tool that allows multiple users to collaboratively write a story, script, or article using LLM assistance.  The tool needs to manage user contributions and ensure coherence and consistency across the generated text.\n* **CEC Application:** Train multiple specialized LLMs (e.g., dialogue writer, plot generator, character developer) using CEC on a variety of writing prompts and collaborative scenarios. This enables them to understand and complement each other's contributions.\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** Use a collaborative text editor library like ProseMirror or CKEditor 5. Integrate LLMs using LangChain and manage shared context using a database or a real-time communication framework like Socket.IO.\n\n**Key Considerations for JavaScript Developers:**\n\n* **Environment Diversity:** Focus on creating diverse training scenarios. This is more crucial than simulating many partners.  Procedural generation is highly effective here.\n* **Scalability:**  LLMs can be resource-intensive.  Explore serverless functions and efficient JavaScript libraries to manage computational costs during training and deployment.\n* **Evaluation:**  Prioritize qualitative feedback and human studies when evaluating the effectiveness of your multi-agent system. User experience is paramount, especially in collaborative scenarios.\n\nBy leveraging the principles of CEC, JavaScript developers can unlock the potential of LLM-based multi-agent systems, creating innovative and truly collaborative web applications.",

Its purpose is to create a diverse set of solvable levels to train agents on, fostering generalization to novel partners and layouts. It does so by manipulating the placement of essential objects (plate piles, onion piles, pots, goals) and agents within the grid, using a base layout as a starting point.  The algorithm guarantees solvability by placing at least one of each required object in a reachable location. Random rotations further diversify the training data. The algorithm also avoids regenerating levels that are identical to held-out levels, ensuring that the agent is always evaluated on novel environments.  This is crucial for measuring true generalization capabilities.\n\n\nKey aspects of the algorithm:\n\n1. **Base Layout Sampling:** It starts by selecting a base layout from a predefined set of layouts.\n2. **Mandatory Object Placement:**  Ensures at least one of each necessary object type is placed in a reachable area of the grid. This is done by first identifying the reachable wall locations and placing one mandatory object randomly in these areas.\n3. **Supplemental Object Placement:** Places additional objects of each type in any remaining free wall locations, adding complexity and variation.\n4. **Agent Positioning:**  For some layouts, agents need to start on opposite halves of the grid to ensure solvability.\n5. **Rotation and Padding:** Randomly rotates the generated level and pads it with walls to a standardized size. This encourages rotational invariance and provides a consistent input size for the agents.\n6. **Held-out Level Check:** Prevents the generation of levels identical to the held-out evaluation set.\n7. **Helper functions:** The code leverages helper functions like `loadWalls`, `rotateGrid`, `padGrid`, and `levelIsEqual`. These functions are environment-specific and their implementations would depend on how the Overcooked environment is represented.\n\n\nThis JavaScript code provides a concrete implementation of the pseudocode, incorporating checks and data structures necessary for a functional level generator. Note that several helper functions are assumed and would need to be implemented based on the chosen environment representation.  This translation from pseudocode to JavaScript aids software engineers in understanding and utilizing the algorithm for their multi-agent AI application development.",
