  "title": "Multi-Agent Actor-Critic Generative AI for Query Resolution and Analysis",
  "abstract": "Abstract-In this paper, we introduce MASQRAD (Multi-Agent Strategic Query Resolution and Diagnostic tool), a transformative framework for query resolution based on the actor-critic model, which utilizes multiple generative AI agents. MASQRAD is excellent at translating imprecise or ambiguous user inquiries into precise and actionable requests. This framework generates pertinent visualizations and responses to these focused queries, as well as thorough analyses and insightful interpretations for users. MASQRAD addresses the common shortcomings of existing solutions in domains that demand fast and precise data interpretation, such as their incapacity to successfully apply AI for generating actionable insights and their challenges with the inherent ambiguity of user queries. MASQRAD functions as a sophisticated multi-agent system but \"masquerades\" to users as a single AI entity, which lowers errors and enhances data interaction. This approach makes use of three primary AI agents: Actor Generative AI, Critic Generative AI, and Expert Analysis Generative AI. Each is crucial for creating, enhancing, and evaluating data interactions. The Actor AI generates Python scripts to generate data visualizations from large datasets within operational constraints, and the Critic AI rigorously refines these scripts through multi-agent debate. Finally, the Expert Analysis AI contextualizes the outcomes to aid in decision-making. With an accuracy rate of 87% when handling tasks related to natural language visualization, MASQRAD establishes new benchmarks for automated data interpretation and showcases a noteworthy advancement that has the potential to revolutionize AI-driven applications.",
  "summary": "This paper introduces MASQRAD, a multi-agent system that translates imprecise user queries into precise visualizations and analyses using multiple specialized generative AI agents (actor, critic, expert).  It aims to overcome common generative AI limitations like hallucinations and scalability issues while creating and validating complex analytical workflows.\n\nKey to LLM-based multi-agent development: MASQRAD leverages LLMs like RoBERTa, LLaMA, GPT-3.5/4, and Claude to handle query interpretation, script generation, validation, and analysis.  The critic agent uses multi-agent debate (MAD) to refine scripts through iterative feedback among multiple LLM instances, showcasing a novel collaborative approach to ensure code accuracy and efficiency.  Prompt engineering is crucial for guiding each agent's task and maintaining alignment with system goals.  The system's modular design allows for the integration of future LLMs and domain adaptation.",
  "takeaways": "This paper presents MASQRAD, a multi-agent system using LLMs for query resolution and data visualization. Here are practical examples of how a JavaScript developer could apply its insights to LLM-based multi-agent AI web projects:\n\n**1. Building a Collaborative Code Generation and Review Tool:**\n\n* **Scenario:**  Imagine building a web app where users provide natural language descriptions of data visualizations they want (e.g., \"Show me a bar chart of sales by region\"). The app generates the required JavaScript code (using D3.js, Chart.js, or similar).\n\n* **MASQRAD Application:**  Implement two agents: an \"Actor\" agent (using an LLM like GPT-3.5 or Codex through a JavaScript API) that generates the initial JavaScript code snippet, and a \"Critic\" agent (using GPT-4) that reviews and refines the code for correctness, efficiency, and best practices.  The Critic could even suggest alternative visualization libraries or code optimizations.\n\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** Use a JavaScript framework like Node.js for the backend to handle the agent interactions and code execution.  LangChain.js can facilitate prompt engineering and agent management.  The frontend could use React or Vue.js to display the generated code and the visualization itself.\n\n* **Example:** User input: \"Plot the distribution of customer ages\".  Actor generates basic Chart.js code. Critic refines it by adding axis labels, tooltips, and responsive design improvements.\n\n\n**2. Interactive Data Exploration with Multi-Agent Q&A:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Create a web app where users can explore a large dataset by asking natural language questions (e.g., \"What are the top 5 products by revenue?\" or \"Show me the sales trend for product X in the last quarter\").\n\n* **MASQRAD Application:** Implement multiple specialized \"Expert\" agents. One agent could be skilled in SQL queries, another in time series analysis, and yet another in generating natural language summaries of the results. The agents collaborate to answer complex user questions by breaking them down into sub-tasks.\n\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** Use a database connector like Sequelize or Prisma in your Node.js backend. The agents could use libraries like Pandas.js for data manipulation and visualization libraries mentioned before.  Communicate between agents using message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Redis) managed via JavaScript libraries.\n\n* **Example:** User input: \"How did the sales of electronics compare to clothing in Q4 2024?\"  The SQL agent retrieves the raw data, the time series agent performs the comparison, and the summarization agent generates a natural language explanation of the trend.\n\n\n**3. Multi-Agent Content Creation and Fact-Checking:**\n\n* **Scenario:** A web application for collaborative content creation where multiple users can contribute to a document.\n\n* **MASQRAD Application:** \"Actor\" agents (representing individual users) contribute text. A \"Critic\" agent uses LLMs to fact-check the generated content against reliable sources and flags potential inconsistencies or inaccuracies.\n\n* **JavaScript Implementation:** Use collaborative text editors (e.g., ProseMirror, CKEditor 5) on the frontend.  Implement the Critic agent using a fact-checking LLM API. Display fact-checking results in real-time using JavaScript.\n\n* **Example:** User 1 writes, \"The population of Tokyo is 40 million.\" The Critic agent checks this fact and flags it as incorrect, suggesting the accurate figure and providing sources.\n\n\n**Key JavaScript Libraries and Frameworks:**\n\n* **LangChain.js:** For prompt engineering, chain management, and agent interaction.\n* **LLM APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere):**  For accessing powerful language models.\n* **Node.js:**  For backend processing and agent coordination.\n* **React/Vue.js:** For dynamic frontend development.\n* **D3.js/Chart.js/Plotly.js:**  For data visualization.\n* **Pandas.js:** For data manipulation in JavaScript.\n* **Message Queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Redis, Kafka) and their JavaScript libraries:** For inter-agent communication.\n\nBy combining these tools, JavaScript developers can translate the multi-agent principles of MASQRAD into practical, interactive web applications powered by the intelligence of LLMs. Remember that effective prompt engineering, as highlighted in the paper, is crucial for achieving high accuracy and relevant responses from the agents.  Focus on refining prompts through iterative experimentation, considering dataset-specific constraints for actor/critic agents and broader contexts for analysis and interpretation agents.",
  "pseudocode": "Here's the JavaScript conversion and explanation of the algorithms found in the provided research paper:\n\n**1. Metric Relevance Prediction (Equation 1)**\n\n```javascript\nfunction predictLabels(queryEmbeddings, weights, bias) {\n  // weights and bias are assumed to be pre-trained/provided\n  const numLabels = weights[0].length; // Number of metrics/labels\n  const labelProbabilities = [];\n\n  for (let i = 0; i < numLabels; i++) {\n    let sum = 0;\n    for (let j = 0; j < queryEmbeddings.length; j++) {\n      sum += queryEmbeddings[j] * weights[j][i];\n    }\n    sum += bias[i];\n    labelProbabilities.push(1 / (1 + Math.exp(-sum))); // Sigmoid activation\n  }\n\n  return labelProbabilities;\n}\n\n\n// Example Usage (assuming you have the embeddings from RoBERTa):\nconst queryEmbeddings = roberta(query);  // Get embeddings from RoBERTa\nconst labelProbabilities = predictLabels(queryEmbeddings, modelWeights, modelBias);\n\n// labelProbabilities now contains probabilities for each metric's relevance to the query.\n```\n\n* **Explanation:** This function predicts the probability of each metric's relevance to a given query.  It takes the query embeddings (output from RoBERTa), pre-trained weights, and bias vectors as input. It performs a weighted sum of the embedding values and applies a sigmoid activation function to output a probability between 0 and 1 for each metric.\n\n\n\n**2. Multi-Head Attention (MHA) (Equations 4 and 5)**\n\nA direct, efficient JavaScript conversion for MHA is complex because it involves matrix operations and tensor manipulations best handled by specialized libraries.  Here's a conceptual representation, and I will give an example of how to implement this using TensorFlow.js, a popular JavaScript library for machine learning:\n\n```javascript\n// Conceptual representation\nfunction multiHeadAttention(query, key, value) {\n  const numHeads = 8; // Example: 8 attention heads\n  const headOutputs = [];\n\n  for (let i = 0; i < numHeads; i++) {\n      const queryi = linearTransform(query, Wq[i]);\n      const keyi = linearTransform(key, Wk[i]);\n      const valuei = linearTransform(value, Wv[i]);\n      headOutputs.push(scaledDotProductAttention(queryi, keyi, valuei));\n  }\n\n  const concatenatedHeads = concatenate(headOutputs);\n  return linearTransform(concatenatedHeads, Wo);\n\n}\n\nfunction scaledDotProductAttention(q, k, v) {\n  const dk = k.shape[-1];\n  const attentionScores = matMul(q, transpose(k)) / Math.sqrt(dk);\n  const attentionWeights = softmax(attentionScores); // Softmax over the scores\n  return matMul(attentionWeights, v);\n}\n\nfunction linearTransform(input, W) {\n    // Matrix multiplication representing the linear transformation\n    return matMul(input, W);\n}\n```\n```javascript\n// Implementation using TensorFlow.js\n\n// Define the MultiHeadAttention layer\nconst mha = tf.layers.multiHeadAttention({\n  numHeads: 8, // Number of heads\n  // other params\n});\n\nconst queryTensor = tf.tensor(query);\nconst keyTensor = tf.tensor(key);\nconst valueTensor = tf.tensor(value);\nconst outputTensor = mha.apply([queryTensor, keyTensor, valueTensor]); //output\n```\n* **Explanation:** MHA calculates attention weights for different parts of the input sequence.  It uses multiple \"heads\" of attention to focus on different relationships within the data.  Each head performs a scaled dot-product attention, and the results are concatenated and transformed to produce the final output.  This is crucial for capturing complex dependencies in the input sequence.\n\n**3. Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) (Equation 3)**\n\n```javascript\nfunction rotaryPositionalEmbeddings(position, dimension, base=10000) {\n  const freq = 1 / (base**(tf.range(0, dimension, 2).toFloat().div(dimension))) //frequency\n\n  const pos_emb = tf.stack([tf.cos(position*freq), tf.sin(position*freq)], axis=-1);\n\n  return tf.reshape(pos_emb, [-1, dimension])\n\n}\n\n\n//Example use case\nconst max_seq_len = 512;\nconst hidden_size = 768;\nconst rope_cache = tf.variable(tf.zeros([max_seq_len, hidden_size]));\n\nfor(var i=0; i < max_seq_len; i++){\n    rope_cache.assign(rope_cache.scatterND([[i]], [rotaryPositionalEmbeddings(i, hidden_size)]))\n}\n\n\n\n```\n\n* **Explanation:** RoPE is a method to encode positional information of tokens in the sequence.  It's especially relevant in Transformer models. This Javascript implementation employs TensorFlow.js to compute and store RoPEs in a cache.\n\nThese JavaScript adaptations and explanations of the key algorithms from the MASQRAD research paper should provide you with a good starting point for practical implementation. Remember that utilizing machine learning libraries like TensorFlow.js will be essential for efficiently handling the matrix and tensor operations involved.",
