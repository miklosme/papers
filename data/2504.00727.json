  "title": "Personality-Driven Decision-Making in LLM-Based Autonomous Agents",
  "abstract": "The embedding of Large Language Models (LLMs) into autonomous agents is a rapidly developing field which enables dynamic, configurable behaviours without the need for extensive domain-specific training. In our previous work, we introduced SANDMAN, a Deceptive Agent architecture leveraging the Five-Factor OCEAN personality model, demonstrating that personality induction significantly influences agent task planning. Building on these findings, this study presents a novel method for measuring and evaluating how induced personality traits affect task selection processes—specifically planning, scheduling, and decision-making—in LLM-based agents. Our results reveal distinct task-selection patterns aligned with induced OCEAN attributes, underscoring the feasibility of designing highly plausible Deceptive Agents for proactive cyber defense strategies.",
  "summary": "This research explores how assigning personality traits to LLM-based autonomous agents (using the OCEAN model – Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism) affects their decision-making process, specifically task selection and prioritization within pre-planned schedules. \n\nKey points for LLM-based multi-agent systems:\n\n* **Personality induction significantly influences task selection**: Agents prioritize tasks aligning with their assigned traits (e.g., conscientious agents prioritize work-related tasks).\n* **Prompt engineering is key**: Carefully crafted prompts effectively induce desired personality traits in LLMs without model parameter adjustments.\n* **Non-determinism is present but aligned with the persona**: Even with identical prompts and induced personalities, agent behavior shows variations, but these variations remain generally consistent with the given personality.\n* **Advanced LLMs exhibit stronger personality effects**: More sophisticated LLMs like GPT-4 demonstrate a greater capacity for reflecting induced personality traits compared to simpler models.\n* **Sampling temperature impacts determinism**: Higher sampling temperatures introduce more randomness in task selection, potentially overriding the influence of the induced persona.\n* **Ethical considerations are paramount**: The ability to induce personality traits raises ethical concerns regarding potential misuse for misinformation or manipulation, necessitating careful oversight.",
  "takeaways": "This paper explores how induced personality traits in LLMs influence task selection in multi-agent systems, a concept readily applicable to JavaScript-driven web applications. Here are some practical examples for JavaScript developers:\n\n**1. Simulating User Behavior:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine building an e-commerce site and wanting to test its robustness against different user shopping styles.\n* **Implementation:**  Create multiple LLM-powered agents, each with a distinct OCEAN personality profile (e.g., a highly conscientious agent meticulously compares prices, a neurotic agent abandons carts frequently). Use a JavaScript framework like LangChain.js to manage agent interactions with the website, simulating diverse user journeys. Track their behavior (clicks, purchases, cart abandonment) to identify potential usability issues or optimize for different user personalities.\n* **Libraries:** LangChain.js, Puppeteer (for browser automation)\n\n**2. Personalized Recommendations:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Develop a content recommendation system that tailors suggestions to individual user preferences, beyond collaborative filtering.\n* **Implementation:** Assign each user an inferred or explicitly chosen OCEAN personality profile.  Use LangChain.js to generate personalized recommendations by priming the LLM with the user's personality and current browsing context. For example, an \"Openness (High)\" user might receive recommendations for niche or experimental content.\n* **Libraries:** LangChain.js, a frontend framework like React or Vue.js to display dynamic recommendations\n\n**3. Dynamic Game AI:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Create an online multiplayer game with LLM-powered NPCs that exhibit believable and diverse behavior.\n* **Implementation:**  Assign each NPC a personality profile. Use a JavaScript game engine like Phaser or Babylon.js. In each game tick, prompt the LLM with the game state and the NPC's personality to decide on their next action.  A \"Neuroticism (High)\" NPC might act erratically under pressure, while an \"Agreeableness (High)\" NPC could be more cooperative.\n* **Libraries:** LangChain.js, Phaser, Babylon.js\n\n**4. Collaborative Web Design Tools:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Develop a tool that assists designers in creating website layouts through collaboration with AI agents.\n* **Implementation:** Create multiple LLM agents specialized in different aspects of web design (e.g., layout, color palettes, typography) with distinct \"designer personalities\" (e.g., minimalist, maximalist). Use a JavaScript framework like React or Vue.js to build an interactive interface where designers can provide input and the agents propose designs based on their respective profiles and the user's feedback.\n* **Libraries:** LangChain.js, React, Vue.js, design libraries like D3.js or fabric.js.\n\n\n**5. Enhanced Chatbots:**\n\n* **Scenario:** Build a chatbot that adapts its communication style to the user's personality, providing a more engaging and empathetic conversation.\n* **Implementation:** Infer the user's personality based on their chat interactions using sentiment analysis and other NLP techniques implemented in JavaScript. Then, adjust the chatbot's LLM prompts to reflect the user's personality, adapting the tone, word choice, and even the type of emojis used.\n* **Libraries:** LangChain.js, NLP libraries like Compromise or natural, frontend framework like React.\n\n**Key JavaScript Considerations:**\n\n* **LangChain.js:** This library provides a powerful framework for developing LLM-powered applications, including multi-agent systems.\n* **Browser Automation:**  Libraries like Puppeteer enable agents to interact with web pages, essential for simulating user behavior or testing web applications.\n* **Frontend Frameworks:** React, Vue.js, or Angular provide efficient ways to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces for multi-agent web applications.\n* **Node.js:** Allows server-side execution of JavaScript, useful for coordinating agents or managing interactions with external APIs.\n\nBy integrating the insights from this paper with these JavaScript tools, developers can create innovative and dynamic web applications that leverage the power of LLM-based multi-agent AI. Remember to consider ethical implications and implement safeguards to prevent misuse.",
  "pseudocode": "No pseudocode block found. However, Figure 1 provides a high-level flowchart of the decision-making process. This flowchart can be represented in JavaScript using a loop and conditional statements.  Let's illustrate the core logic with some example code:\n\n```javascript\nasync function agentDecisionMaking(personality, toDoList, currentTime) {\n  const completedList = [];\n\n  while (toDoList.length > 0) {\n    const prompt = `\n      Personality: ${personality}\n      Current Time: ${currentTime}\n      To-Do List: ${JSON.stringify(toDoList)}\n      Completed List: ${JSON.stringify(completedList)}\n      Instructions: Select the next task to perform. Return only the task UID.\n    `;\n\n    const llmResponse = await queryLLM(prompt); // Replace with your LLM interaction logic\n    const selectedTaskUID = llmResponse.trim();\n\n    const selectedTask = toDoList.find(task => task.uid === selectedTaskUID);\n\n    if (selectedTask) {\n      completedList.push(selectedTask);\n      toDoList = toDoList.filter(task => task.uid !== selectedTaskUID);\n      currentTime = addMinutes(currentTime, selectedTask.duration); //  Helper function to increment time\n      console.log(`Selected Task: ${selectedTask.name}, Time: ${currentTime}`);\n    } else {\n      console.error(\"LLM returned an invalid UID. Handling error...\"); //  Error handling mechanism\n      //  You might want to implement strategies like reprompting or selecting a default task.\n    }\n\n  }\n  return completedList;\n}\n\n\n// Example usage:\nconst personality = \"Imagine you are a conscientious person, characterized by being organized, disciplined, efficient.\";\nconst toDoList = [\n  { name: \"Email\", duration: 30, uid: \"email_9am\" },\n  { name: \"Meeting\", duration: 60, uid: \"meeting_10am\" },\n  { name: \"Break\", duration: 15, uid: \"break_11am\" },\n];\nconst currentTime = \"9:00 AM\";\n\nagentDecisionMaking(personality, toDoList, currentTime)\n  .then(completedList => console.log(\"All tasks completed:\", completedList))\n  .catch(error => console.error(\"Error during task selection:\", error));\n\n// Helper function (implementation would depend on your date/time library)\nfunction addMinutes(timeString, minutesToAdd) { /* ... */ }\nasync function queryLLM(prompt){/* ... */} // Example using OpenAI API:\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThis JavaScript code simulates the core agent decision-making loop described in the paper's Figure 1. It iteratively presents a prompt to an LLM (you'll need to integrate your specific LLM interaction here), receives a task UID, updates the task lists and current time, and continues until all tasks are complete. The prompt incorporates the personality, current time, remaining tasks, and completed tasks to contextualize the LLM's decision.  Note that error handling and the specific implementation of time management and LLM querying are left as exercises since the paper doesn't provide those details.  This code focuses on illustrating the core decision-making loop.",
