# Daily Digest (August 30, 2024)

Attention AI enthusiasts! Buckle up for a whirlwind tour of the hottest papers hitting the scene in the last 24 hours. We've got a smorgasbord of cutting-edge research that'll make your neural networks tingle!

First up, cognitive models are taking center stage in the world of engagement prediction. [How can cognitive models improve LLM-based prediction of user engagement?](/2408.16147) This groundbreaking study shows that Instance-Based Learning models are outperforming traditional time-series forecasters in healthcare applications. It's like giving your AI a personalized crystal ball!

But wait, there's more! Ever wondered how to get your AI agents to play nice together? [How can LLM agents with different roles collaborate for efficient planning?](/2408.16462) introduces a game-changing Consensus Planning Protocol. It's like a universal translator for AI agents, allowing them to coordinate seamlessly, no matter their background. This could revolutionize complex systems from supply chains to multi-agent LLM applications!

For the optimization aficionados out there, we've got a treat. [How to optimize non-smooth functions with linear constraints using block-coordinate methods?](/2408.16424) This paper is serving up a decentralized algorithm that's perfect for large-scale problems. It's like giving each of your AI agents their own piece of the optimization pie!

Last but certainly not least, we're tackling the age-old problem of aligning LLMs with rules, but with a twist! [How to align LLMs with rules without human annotations?](/2408.16667) introduces Iterative Graph Alignment, a self-improvement technique for LLMs that doesn't need human hand-holding. It's like sending your AI to charm school, but it teaches itself!

That's all for today's AI digest, folks. Remember, in the world of artificial intelligence, yesterday's science fiction is today's research paper. Stay curious, stay innovative, and keep pushing those boundaries!
